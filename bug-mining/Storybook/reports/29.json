This does not happen when the interfaces from `svelte/elements` are extended/type-intersected \"as is\".\n\n<img width=\"1430\" height=\"781\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88cf337f-3521-4f8c-89f9-209e5def7634\" />\n\n### Reproduction link\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-vat7p589?file=src%2Fstories%2FExtendsModifiesProps.stories.svelte\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Go to the link above.\n2. Open `ExtendsModifiesProps` component story in the preview.\n3. Notice that all the inherited HTML attributes are displayed in the generated args table.\n4. In contrast, view the `ExtendsProps` component story in the preview.\n5. Notice that the inherited HTML attributes are properly ignored.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe generated documentation should only display the component's own, explicitly defined props (e.g., `label`), regardless of whether `Omit<>` or other utility types are used. The long list of inherited HTML attributes should be omitted from the primary controls table to keep the component's API clear and usable.\n\n### System\n\n```bash\nSystem:\n    OS: Linux 6.8 Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)\n    CPU: (14) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 5 125U\n    Shell: 3.7.0 - /usr/bin/fish\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.16.0 - ~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/22.16.0/bin/node\n    npm: 10.9.2 - ~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/22.16.0/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.11.1 - ~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/22.16.0/bin/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 138.0.7204.183\n  npmPackages:\n    @storybook/addon-a11y: ^9.0.15 => 9.0.15 \n    @storybook/addon-docs: ^9.0.15 => 9.0.15 \n    @storybook/addon-svelte-csf: ^5.0.4 => 5.0.4 \n    @storybook/addon-themes: ^9.0.15 => 9.0.15 \n    @storybook/addon-vitest: ^9.0.15 => 9.0.15 \n    @storybook/sveltekit: ^9.0.15 => 9.0.15 \n    eslint-plugin-storybook: ^9.0.13 => 9.0.13 \n    storybook: ^9.0.15 => 9.0.15\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"JReinhold","id":5678122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzgxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5678122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold","html_url":"https://github.com/JReinhold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JReinhold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/32171/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/32171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
