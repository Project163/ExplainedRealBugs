Describe the bug\n\nAfter upgrading to Storybook 9, a simple play function like this\n```tsx\nexport const Primary: Story = {\n  args: {\n    primary: true,\n    label: 'Button',\n  },\n  play: (ctx) => {\n    const canvas = within(ctx.canvasElement);\n    const btn = canvas.getByRole('button');\n    expect(btn).toSatisfy((el: Element) => !!el);\n  },\n};\n```\nfails with\n```\nError: Invalid Chai property: toSatisfy. Did you mean \"satisfy\"?\n```\n\nAlthough replacing `toSatisfy` with `satisfy` makes the tests run, doing this introduces a TypeScript error:\n```\nProperty 'satisfy' does not exist on type 'Assertion<HTMLElement>'. Did you mean 'toSatisfy'?\n```\n\nIt seems like the type definition for `expect` doesn't match the implementation?\n\n### Reproduction link\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-9qdvbb5y?file=src%2Fstories%2FButton.stories.ts\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1. Go to the reproduction link\n2. Wait for Storybook to start\n3. Go to the \"Interactions\" tab in Storybook\n4. See the error message\n\n### System\n\n```bash\n## Original environment\nStorybook Environment Info:\n\n  System:\n    OS: macOS 15.4.1\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.14.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/node\n    npm: 11.2.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.9.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/pnpm <----- active\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 136.0.7103.114\n    Edge: 137.0.3296.52\n    Safari: 18.4\n  npmPackages:\n    @storybook/addon-a11y: ^9.0.4 => 9.0.4 \n    @storybook/addon-docs: ^9.0.4 => 9.0.4 \n    @storybook/addon-vitest: ^9.0.4 => 9.0.4 \n    @storybook/react-vite: ^9.0.4 => 9.0.4 \n    chromatic: ^12.0.0 => 12.0.0 \n    eslint-plugin-storybook: ^9.0.4 => 9.0.4 \n    storybook: ^9.0.4 => 9.0.4 \n    storybook-addon-pseudo-states: ^9.0.4 => 9.0.4 \n    storybook-addon-tag-badges: ^2.0.0 => 2.0.0 \n\n## Reproduction\nStorybook Environment Info:\n\n  System:\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.19.1 - /usr/local/bin/node\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\n    npm: 10.8.2 - /usr/local/bin/npm <----- active\n    pnpm: 8.15.6 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\n  npmPackages:\n    @storybook/addon-docs: ^9.1.0-alpha.2 => 9.1.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/addon-onboarding: ^9.1.0-alpha.2 => 9.1.0-alpha.2 \n    @storybook/react-vite: ^9.1.0-alpha.2 => 9.1.0-alpha.2 \n    storybook: ^9.1.0-alpha.2 => 9.1.0-alpha.2\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kasperpeulen","id":1035299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzUyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1035299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen","html_url":"https://github.com/kasperpeulen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/31643/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/31643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
