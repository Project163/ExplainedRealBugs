Disclaimer** This information might be inaccurate, due to it being generated automatically\nThis appears to be a UX issue where test settings can be modified while tests are running, causing Vitest to hang. To fix this:  1. Disable test settings controls while tests are running by modifying the test runner UI component 2. Add a `isRunning` state check before allowing settings changes 3. Add a loading/disabled state to the settings controls  The relevant code would likely be in the test runner UI components and test manager. Without access to the specific files, I cannot provide exact code locations. However, this would require:  - Adding state management for test run status - Disabling settings controls based on that state - Preventing settings changes during active test runs  This is a straightforward UI fix to prevent an edge case that causes Vitest to hang.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n\n#### About Greptile\n</summary>\n\nThis response provides a starting point for your research, not a precise solution.\n\nHelp us improve!

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing in `/code/addons/test/src/node/test-manager.ts` to prevent channel overload\n- Added new `useTestProvider` hook in `/code/addons/test/src/use-test-provider-state.ts` for unified test state management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing in `/code/addons/test/src/node/test-manager.ts` to prevent channel overload\n- Added new `useTestProvider` hook in `/code/addons/test/src/use-test-provider-state.ts` for unified test state management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing

management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing

management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing in `/code/addons/test/src/node/test-manager.ts` to prevent channel overload\n- Added new `useTestProvider` hook in `/code/addons/test/src/use-test-provider-state.ts` for unified test state management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment

refactor of Storybook's addon-test to use the new Test Provider API and drop Vitest 2 support, focusing on improved state management, error handling, and UI consistency.\n\n- Added new `TestProviderRender` component in `/code/addons/test/src/components/TestProviderRender.tsx` for centralized test status display and control\n- Implemented batched and throttled test result processing in `/code/addons/test/src/node/test-manager.ts` to prevent channel overload\n- Added new `useTestProvider` hook in `/code/addons/test/src/use-test-provider-state.ts` for unified test state management\n- Migrated status handling to server-side in `/code/core/src/shared/test-provider-store/index.ts` for better consistency\n- Updated error handling with detailed stack traces and improved UI feedback in `/code/addons/test/src/components/GlobalErrorModal.tsx`\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment
