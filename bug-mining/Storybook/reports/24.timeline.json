Here's a **clear summary of the bug** and potential **solution directions**:\n\n---\n\n### 🐞 **Bug Summary**\nOn Node.js **23.9 / 23.10**, Storybook fails to:\n1. **Resolve `../frameworks/react-vite/...`**\n   - ✅ Fix: Use `@storybook/react-vite/node` instead.\n   - This is likely due to stricter ESM resolution in newer Node versions.\n\n2. **Handle `__dirname`**\n   - Node 23+ doesn't support `__dirname` in ESM (ECMAScript modules).\n   - ✅ Fix: Replace with:\n     ```js\n     import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n     import { dirname } from 'path';\n\n     const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\n     const __dirname = dirname(__filename);\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ **Reproduction Steps (Reconfirmed)**\n```bash\nnvm use 23\nyarn task compile\ncd code\nyarn storybook:ui\n```\n\nFails due to module resolution + `__dirname`.\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 **Environment**\n- **OS**: Linux (Arch, kernel 6.13)\n- **Node**: 23.9 / 23.10\n- **Yarn**: 4.6.0\n- **Storybook**: In a monorepo (exact version unknown)\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Fix Plan**\n1. Replace all paths like:\n   ```js\n   import something from '../frameworks/react-vite/...';\n   ```\n   with:\n   ```js\n   import something from '@storybook/react-vite/node';\n   ```\n\n2. Replace any use of `__dirname` or `__filename` with:\n   ```js\n   import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n   import { dirname } from 'path';\n\n   const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\n   const __dirname = dirname(__filename);\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### 💬 Additional Notes\n- This issue stems from **Node 23’s stricter ESM rules**, which is why it wasn’t happening on older Node versions.\n- You might want to add a `.cjs` fallback or define `\"type\": \"module\"` smartly in sub-packages if you’re mixing CJS and ESM.\n\n---\n\n

sure!\n\nIt's possibly no longer a good first issue, though.\n\nWhen I reported this, I thought there were code patterns to fix in the `code/.storybook` folder, but now that I'm aware of #30506, there's also a chance that `code/.storybook/manager.tsx` goes undetected, which would prevent you from reproducing and fixing this
