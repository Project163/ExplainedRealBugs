In the `createPlaywrightTest` function, modify the `page.evaluate` calls to exclude props from serialization:  ```ts // Before page.evaluate, destructure props const { props, ...storyRefType } = storyRef;  // Pass storyRefType instead of full storyRef to both page.evaluate calls await page.evaluate(async (wrappedStoryRef: WrappedStoryRef) => {   // ... existing callback code }, storyRefType);  const mountResult = await mount(storyRef, ...restArgs);  await page.evaluate(async (wrappedStoryRef: WrappedStoryRef) => {   // ... existing callback code }, storyRefType); ```  This prevents serialization of function props while maintaining story loading and play functionality.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n\n#### About Greptile\n</summary>\n\nThis response provides a starting point for your research, not a precise solution.\n\nHelp us improve!

Please submit all PRs to the `next` branch unless they are specific to the current release. Storybook maintainers cherry-pick bug and documentation fixes into the `main` branch as part of the release process, so you shouldn't need to worry about this. For additional guidance: https://storybook.js.org/docs/contribute\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nCreate a \"portable\" file which composes all stories of a given component. This is needed because of a limitation of Playwright's CT mechanisms:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Button.stories.playwright (or whatever better name)\r\nimport { composeStories } from '@storybook/react';\r\nimport * as stories from './Button.stories';\r\n\r\nexport default composeStories(stories);\r\n```\r\n\r\nImport these composed stories in your playwright test file, as well as use the newly added `createTest` function from `@storybook/react/experimental_playwright`. The `test` function will contain a `mount` argument which will load, mount and run the play function of the story.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { createTest } from '@storybook/react/experimental_playwright';\r\nimport { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/experimental-ct-react';\r\nimport stories from './Button.stories.playwright';\r\n\r\nconst test = createTest(base);\r\n\r\ntest('Renders the story', async ({ mount }) => {\r\n  await mount(<stories.Primary/>);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [x] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [x] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n_This section is mandatory for all contributions.

#31150\r\n\r\n<!-- If your PR is related to an issue, provide the number(s) above; if it resolves multiple issues, be sure to break them up (e.g. \"closes #1000, closes #1001\"). -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nThank you for contributing to Storybook! Please submit all PRs to the `next` branch unless they are specific to the current release.

For additional guidance: https://storybook.js.org/docs/contribute\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\n #31150 details the proposed fix. Essentially, we do not need to pass the props to the page to perform the storybook load/play steps, which are wrapped in `page.evaluate()`. They are extraneous. Passing them here is a problem since they have to be serialisable to go through `page.evalaute()` and functions are not, which prevents useful playwright CT native functionality that allows functions to be passed from tests.\r\n\r\nSo by omitting them from being passed to the `page.evaluate()` calls in the first place, but retaining them when calling the real \"mount\" function, we get the desired native functionality without disrupting storybook.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [x] integration tests  **--> or whatever the portable stories kitchen sink tests are classified as 🙂**\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nNone needed as this would be exactly the same as doing what I have added to the `\"renders story with props\"`  portable stories kitchen sink test. Essentially, just pass a function from a playwright test to a portable story, and check that it actually works.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to indicate which documentation has been updated. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add or update documentation reflecting your changes\r\n- [ ] If you are deprecating/removing a feature, make sure to update\r\n      [MIGRATION.MD](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md)\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Maintainers\r\n\r\n- [ ] When this PR is ready for testing, make sure to add `ci:normal`, `ci:merged` or `ci:daily` GH label to it to run a specific set of sandboxes.

component testing to properly handle function props in portable stories by modifying the serialization process.\n\n- Separated props from story reference before `page.evaluate()` calls to avoid function serialization issues\n- Modified `createPlaywrightTest` to maintain full props for Playwright's mount function while excluding them from browser evaluation\n- Added test case in `test-storybooks/portable-stories-kitchen-sink/react/stories/Button.playwright.tsx` to verify function prop handling\n- Fixed regression where function event handlers couldn't be passed from test files\n- Ensures compatibility with Playwright's native component testing functionality\n\n\n\n<sub>💡 (1/5) You can manually trigger the bot by mentioning @greptileai in a comment!</sub>\n\n<!--
