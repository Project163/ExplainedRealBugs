Answer -->\nThis is a known accessibility issue in Storybook 8.x: the core tab components (like those used for Controls, Actions, Interactions, etc.) do not set the required `aria-selected` attribute on tab elements. As a result, screen readers—especially Narrator on Windows/Edge—may announce all tabs as \"selected\" or fail to announce the correct state, matching what you’re seeing. This gap is confirmed in multiple issues and is tracked for future improvement, but is not yet fixed in 8.x ([issue #32235](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/32235), [issue #23640](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/23640), [issue #26674](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/26674)).\n\nAs a workaround, you can patch your local Storybook tab components to add `aria-selected={active}` to each tab button, following [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/). For example, in your tab rendering code:\n\n```jsx\n<button\n  role=\"tab\"\n  aria-selected={isSelected}\n  // ...other props\n>\n  Tab label\n</button>\n```\n\nThis will ensure screen readers announce the correct selected state. Storybook is actively working on accessibility improvements for future releases (9.x+), so keep an eye on updates if you want a built-in fix.\n\nIf you’re using custom tab components in your stories, make sure they also follow this pattern. If the issue only appears in your own components and not in the default Storybook UI, please provide a minimal reproduction so we can help further.\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Screen readers now correctly announce selected state, enhancing keyboard navigation and compliance with ARIA tab patterns without changing visual behavior. This ensures clearer focus feedback for assistive technology users and aligns the component with expected accessibility standards, with no impact to mouse or touch interactions.\n\n<!-- end of

It would be lovely if you could give this branch a go and check if indeed it behaves as you intended.\n\nOther fixes on the branch include handling of buttons, tooltips, popovers and toolbars, as well as misc small fixes and partial fixes for the problems in ArgsTable. We still have work planned to rewrite the sidebar, to create a distinct menu component, etc.\n\nYou can see the accessibility roadmap here: https://github.com/orgs/storybookjs/projects/23/views/1\n\nI will close the issue now as fixed in Storybook 10.1 (knowing that we won't be able to backport most of the fixes on that branch).
