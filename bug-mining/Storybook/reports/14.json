We are not in control of this resolution, we simply pass in a string to a custom coverage reporter. See docs at:\n\nhttps://vitest.dev/guide/coverage.html#custom-coverage-reporter\n\nThe problem is here on line 45:\n\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/08dca94c3754e6eb8dcebed3d3ef30f384133964/code/addons/test/src/node/vitest-manager.ts#L44-L50\n\nWe could try to use `require.resolve` (or the ESM equivalent) to get an absolute path at runtime (relative to the current file) instead of referencing the export of our package.\n\n## Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/gawdfrey/storybook-experimental-monorepo\n\n1. `npm install`\n2. `npm run build`\n3. `npm run dev`\n4. Go to `localhost:6006` and try to run a test with coverage enabled, you should see error in console.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ndelangen","id":3070389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzAzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3070389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen","html_url":"https://github.com/ndelangen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/29785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/29785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
