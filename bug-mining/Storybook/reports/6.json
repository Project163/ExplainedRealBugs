They should match.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nOpen storybook in Chrome.\r\n\r\nOpen \"Issues\" in the dev tools.\r\n\r\nNote the error `Incorrect use of <label for=FORM_ELEMENT>`\r\n\r\n> The label's for attribute doesn't match any element id. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form and accessibility tools from working correctly.\r\n> To fix this issue, make sure the label's for attribute references the correct id of a form field.\n\n### System\n\n```shell\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.15 Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.18.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.18.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 3.5.1 - ~/.yarn/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.19.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.18.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 114.0.5735.198\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe label is not visible to non screenreader users. It uses the -10000px position absolute technique to be rendered off the page.\r\nIt's not a large bug, most users won't be affected at all. But, I believe it's an accessibility issue.","closed_by":{"login":"yannbf","id":1671563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzE1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1671563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf","html_url":"https://github.com/yannbf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yannbf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/23463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/23463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
