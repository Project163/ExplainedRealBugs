can fix this problem, but the underlaying issue of this repro is the multiple versions of storybook being installed.\n(multiple CLI versions, multiple core package versions)\n\nThis is causing `npm` to hoist some packages, and not others.\nI've looked at what it's doing, and merging `@storybook/core` and `storybook` package would actually help, I think. (though I did not try this, so am not sure it would resolve all)\n\nWhat I was able to do was hack the `node_modules` a bit to essentially have the `require.resolve` around the string.\n\nThat solves the issue, and I'm able to run the tests.\nI'll open a PR.\n\nBut it does feel like this monorepo setup is not in a state, that seems long-term supportable.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/comments/2535846909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ndelangen","id":3070389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzAzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3070389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen","html_url":"https://github.com/ndelangen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15617809770,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqfmc6hu-pzzwAAAAOi5N1q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/events/15617809770","actor":{"login":"ndelangen","id":3070389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzAzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3070389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen","html_url":"https://github.com/ndelangen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"805e18ab5b3e1c01992d39f4a71a23c23186307b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/commits/805e18ab5b3e1c01992d39f4a71a23c23186307b","created_at":"2024-12-11T12:26:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ndelangen","id":3070389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzAzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3070389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen","html_url":"https://github.com/ndelangen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndelangen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-11T12:26:07Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T12:26:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30026","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30026/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30026/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30026/events","html_url":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/30026","id":2732841652,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAzqfmc6E2jqP","number":30026,"title":"Addon

Greptile Summary\n\nThis PR fixes module resolution issues in monorepo setups by using `require.resolve` to get absolute paths for coverage reporter and setup files in the Storybook test addon.\n\n- Added `packageDir` constant using `require.resolve` and `dirname` to get absolute package root path in `vitest-manager.ts`\n- Updated coverage reporter path in `vitest-manager.ts` to use absolute path with `join(packageDir, 'dist/node/coverage-reporter.js')`\n- Modified setup file paths in `vitest-plugin/index.ts` to use absolute paths with `packageDir` \n- Fixed issue where Vitest failed to resolve `@storybook/experimental-addon-test/internal/coverage-reporter` in monorepo environments\n\n\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment
