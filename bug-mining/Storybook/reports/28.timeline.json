The fix modifies the `useRouter` export in the Next.js navigation mock (`code/frameworks/nextjs/src/export-mocks/navigation/index.ts`) to return the mocked `navigationAPI` instead of the actual Next.js router.\n\nPreviously, `useRouter` was implemented as a passthrough mock that called the real Next.js router implementation. This worked in earlier versions but broke with Next.js 15's changes to the Link component behavior. The new implementation returns the mock `navigationAPI` object when available, ensuring all navigation actions (push, replace, forward, back, prefetch, refresh) stay within the Storybook context.\n\nThis change integrates seamlessly with the existing navigation mock system, which already provides the `navigationAPI` object through the `createNavigation` function and manages mock lifecycle through `getRouter`. The fix maintains the same error handling pattern used elsewhere in the mock system by throwing `NextjsRouterMocksNotAvailable` when mocks aren't initialized.\n\n## Confidence score: 4/5\n\n• This fix addresses a clear regression and follows established patterns in the codebase\n• The solution is targeted and minimal, changing only the problematic `useRouter` implementation\n• Needs manual testing verification since automated test coverage is incomplete\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/32131/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/32131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19087692087,"node_id":"CE_lADOAzqfmc6np_IHzwAAAARxtxE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/events/19087692087","actor":{"login":"valentinpalkovic","id":5889929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODk5Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5889929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic","html_url":"https://github.com/valentinpalkovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valentinpalkovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-11T12:44:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/comments/3180388005","html_url":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30390#issuecomment-3180388005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/30390","id":3180388005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqfmc69kN6l","user":{"login":"MilesWellsSVT","id":80766315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzY2MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80766315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT","html_url":"https://github.com/MilesWellsSVT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-12T17:49:12Z","updated_at":"2025-08-12T17:49:12Z","body":"Hello! I saw the linked PR that closed this issue was released as part of 9.1.2. However I still see this issue when using `appDirectory: true` as described in the original bug report. I have created a minimal reproduction [here](https://github.com/MilesWellsSVT/storybook-9.1.2-link-bug).\n\nThis reproduction was created by:\n\n1. `npx create-next-app@latest` (resolved to 15.4.6, accepted all defaults)\n2. cd into created directory\n3. `npm create storybook@latest` (resolved to 9.1.2, \"Recommended\" configuration)\n4. [Add a usage of `<Link>` to the example Page](https://github.com/MilesWellsSVT/storybook-9.1.2-link-bug/blob/main/src/stories/Page.tsx#L23-L28)\n5. [Add the `appDirectory` parameter](https://github.com/MilesWellsSVT/storybook-9.1.2-link-bug/blob/main/.storybook/preview.ts#L19-L21)\n\nThe following is a recording of the issue after the following steps:\n1. Use the steps to recreate above (or clone the linked reproduction and `npm i`) and run the storybook with `npm run storybook`\n2. Access either of the example Page stories\n3. Click the example link\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7da5fc91-0976-4b3a-a28b-00faae53c6c7\n\n\nIf you remove the `appDirectory: true` parameter and follow the same steps you will see the `Link` mocked as expected (including prefetches):\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df5d01d4-e213-42ea-8752-08ac91ddc8bb\n\nI have also created a branch named `webpack` in the linked reproduction repo which has the same behavior. All I did there was:\n1. Switch `@storybook/nextjs-vite` to `@storybook/nextjs`\n2. Remove usage of the `@storybook/addon-vitest` addon\n\nOn the `webpack` branch I also attempted @MukaNakazato's workaround, unfortunately to no success. I didn't commit this part. All I did to test it was copy the provided `webpackFinal` into `.storybook/main.ts`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/comments/3180388005/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MilesWellsSVT","id":80766315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzY2MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80766315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT","html_url":"https://github.com/MilesWellsSVT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MilesWellsSVT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19118460562,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAzqfmc6np_IHzwAAAARzjI6S","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/events/19118460562","actor":{"login":"MukaNakazato","id":165648966,"node_id":"U_kgDOCd-aRg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165648966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato","html_url":"https://github.com/MukaNakazato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-12T17:49:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19118460583,"node_id":"SE_lADOAzqfmc6np_IHzwAAAARzjI6n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/events/19118460583","actor":{"login":"MukaNakazato","id":165648966,"node_id":"U_kgDOCd-aRg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165648966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato","html_url":"https://github.com/MukaNakazato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MukaNakazato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-12T17:49:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19239271718,"node_id":"SE_lADOAzqfmc6np_IHzwAAAAR6v_0m","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/events/19239271718","actor":{"login":"tpzum","id":144311593,"node_id":"U_kgDOCJoFKQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144311593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum","html_url":"https://github.com/tpzum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tpzum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-20T07:19:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"acto
