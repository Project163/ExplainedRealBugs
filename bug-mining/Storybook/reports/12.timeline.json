Summary\n\nThis PR addresses a CSS conflict causing brand image resizing on hot reloads by modifying the `maxWidth` property in the `Brand.tsx` component.\n\n- Added `!important` to `maxWidth: '150px'` in `code/core/src/manager/components/sidebar/Brand.tsx` for the `Img` styled component\n- This change ensures the brand image maintains its size during theme toggles and hot reloads\n- While
