This is causing a lot of issues in our whole codebase which I now have to solve or use `@ts-expect-error xxx`. \r\n\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nWill add later\n\n### System\n\n```bash\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.4.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.18.2 - /private/var/folders/d8/3cn5tl156v50k40922pwygm80000gp/T/xfs-09549afd/node\r\n    Yarn: 4.1.1 - /private/var/folders/d8/3cn5tl156v50k40922pwygm80000gp/T/xfs-09549afd/yarn <----- active\r\n    npm: 9.8.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.18.2/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 124.0.6367.60\r\n    Safari: 17.4.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    eslint-plugin-storybook: 0.8.0 => 0.8.0\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kasperpeulen","id":1035299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzUyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1035299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen","html_url":"https://github.com/kasperpeulen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasperpeulen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/26912/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/storybookjs/storybook/issues/26912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
