Greeting -->\nHi @frankswarm! I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the storybook team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThis is a regression or at least an undocumented change in Storybook Angular v9. The merging logic now overlays Storybook-specific options from angular.json on top of the options loaded from the browserTarget, but does not inherit missing fields from the browserTarget if they're not explicitly set. This means you now have to duplicate stylePreprocessorOptions, assets, and styles in the storybook/build-storybook block in angular.json—otherwise, they won't be picked up by Storybook, even if they're present in your browserTarget config. This differs from previous versions, where these options would be inherited automatically if not set on the Storybook target.\n\nThere’s no official documentation or migration guide about this change, and it doesn’t appear to be an intentional breaking change—just a side effect of recent architectural updates in the Angular integration for Storybook v9. For now, explicit duplication is required to ensure your styles and assets are picked up as expected. If you want to avoid this, you may want to follow up with maintainers for clarification or a potential fix in future releases.\n\nYou can see the relevant merging logic and context in the code here:  \n[getBuilderOptions in framework-preset-angular-cli.ts](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/6aeb2e39dc3c1c60082c30b897392af95eb062ca/code/frameworks/angular/src/server/framework-preset-angular-cli.ts)  \n[Recent ESM conversion PR](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/32006)\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

The issue occurred in v9 when the framework switched to shallow spread merging (`{...browserTargetOptions, ...options.angularBuilderOptions}`), which overwrote entire nested objects instead of preserving inherited properties from the browserTarget.\r\n\r\nThe fix introduces a custom `deepMerge` function that recursively merges nested objects while preserving arrays and handling null/undefined values properly. This ensures that when Storybook-specific options don't specify nested properties, they are inherited from the browserTarget configuration, maintaining the expected behavior from v8 while still allowing complete override when needed.\r\n\r\nThe implementation adds comprehensive unit tests covering various merge scenarios including preservation of browserTarget options, override behavior, deep merging of nested objects, array handling, and complex nested structures. The `tsConfig` property continues to be handled separately to maintain existing fallback logic for locating TypeScript configuration files.\r\n\r\nThis change integrates with the existing Angular CLI webpack preset system in `framework-preset-angular-cli.ts`, specifically in the `getBuilderOptions` function that prepares configuration for the Angular build system within Storybook's webpack pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Confidence score: 4/5\r\n\r\n• This is a well-implemented fix for a specific regression with comprehensive test coverage\r\n• The implementation correctly handles edge cases and maintains backward compatibility \r\n• The test file duplicates the deepMerge implementation instead of testing the actual exported function, which could lead to implementation drift\r\n\r\n<!--

I don't know if this is a change in Angular or Storybook but the problem is, if the storybook project in an app does not contain `styles: []` it gets initialized with `styles: []` anyways. I haven't found any code within `@storybook/angular` that writes `styles: []` and it's already there in \n\n```typescript\nexport async function webpackFinal(baseConfig: webpack.Configuration, options: PresetOptions\n``` \n\ninside `options` with an empty `styles: []`\n\nThis means, whatever is in browserTarget, it's overwritten by the empty ` styles: []` from the storybook project. \n\nAn easy fix would of course be to just merge them instead of overwrite them during the merge but is this even the wanted behavior? If you explicitly define different `styles: [...]` in your storybook project, you probably expect that it's not using the styles from the `browserTarget`, I might be wrong 😬 \n\n@valentinpalkovic ~~any idea how storybook should behave here or what the Storybook 8 behavior was? I never had styles in my storybook project defined and always relied on the browserTarget styles, so I don't know the use-cases~~\n\n**Edit:** Just verified it in my Storybook 8 project. \n\nIn Storybook 8, if you define `styles: []` explicitly, then it overwrites the `browserTarget` styles\nWe now need a way to check if `styles: []` was set explicitly or implicitly and if implicitly, ignore it and use the browserTarget

An easy fix would of course be to just merge them instead of overwrite them during the merge but is this even the wanted behavior? If you explicitly define different `styles: [...]` in your storybook project, you probably expect that it's not using the styles from the `browserTarget`, I might be wrong\n\nI feels like this should be the behaviour yes. It should take exact options from browserTarget if defined. when I additionally set `styles` in the storybook config, then I would expect storybook to take this options **instead** of the browserTarget option.
