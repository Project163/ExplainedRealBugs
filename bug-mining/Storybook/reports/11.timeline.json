loading Storybook instances built with Vite on devices locked to pre-2022 browser versions.\r\n\r\nCloses #29030\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nReplaced usage of an API potentially unavailable in legacy browsers (`Array.prototype.at`) with a functionally equivalent alternative (`[]`). This should allow running Storybook in browsers that support ES Modules (script type=\"module\") but don't have the `Array.prototype.at` method.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n1. Run a sandbox for template, e.g. `yarn task --task sandbox --start-from auto --template react-vite/default-ts`\r\n2. Open Storybook in your browser without Array.prototype.at support but with ES modules support (e.g. iOS Safari 15.3)\r\n3.
