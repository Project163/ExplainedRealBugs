the problem is related of using posix with a config directory in Win32 format:\r\n\r\nAt line 17\r\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/21013/files#diff-2863b3fa2d25f11b17809621643879a0efe0d28b9512def8fd6708b6a5eb3875R17\r\n\r\nIt's using a mix of slashes, options.configDir has a windows format, but pattern is with posix format, so the final result is like:\r\n\r\n`src/**/*.mdx`\r\n\r\nwhen it was waiting for something like \r\n\r\n/Users/user.dot.name/folder/storybook-sandboxes/vue3-vite/default-ts/after-storybook/src/**/*.mdx\r\n\r\nThat's because the options.configDir is `C:\\Users\\user.dot.name\\folder\\storybook-sandboxes\\vue3-vite\\default-ts\\after-storybook\\.storybook`\r\n\r\nAnd also, glob still retuning absolute paths from each file in windows format, but the code is waiting a posix format.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/21013/files#diff-2863b3fa2d25f11b17809621643879a0efe0d28b9512def8fd6708b6a5eb3875R16\r\n\r\nSo, in the map, for each file, we need to transform into posix to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nI did it a simple test returning an array string like\r\n\r\n```\r\n        return [\r\n
