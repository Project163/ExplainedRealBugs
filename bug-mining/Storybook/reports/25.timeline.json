The fix requires:  1. Update `@storybook/test` types in `code/lib/test/src/index.ts` to include both `satisfy` and `toSatisfy` in the assertion interface:  ```ts interface CustomAssertion {   satisfy(predicate: (value: any) => boolean): void;   toSatisfy(predicate: (value: any) => boolean): void; } ```  2. Add an alias in the test framework adapter to map `toSatisfy` to `satisfy` in Chai assertions.  The relevant code would be in the test framework adapter implementation, likely in `code/lib/test-runner/src/frameworks/`.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n\n#### About Greptile\n</summary>\n\nThis response provides a starting point for your research, not a precise solution.\n\nHelp us improve!
