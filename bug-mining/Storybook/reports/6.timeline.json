What\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the technical \"why\" behind your changes -->\r\nUpgrade storybook to v7.4.1\r\n\r\nWe are expecting to create new guidelines on the way we will write storybook files on storybook 7, that will have to be done in a different task\r\n\r\nIt is also IMPORTANT to keep in mind that even though we refactored storybook files like Icons and Floater to follow the new storybook 7 rules we are not pretending to refactor all the files in this specific PR, so the idea will be to refactor these files and follow the new guidelines while working on components (so we should take that into consideration while estimating). With this current solution we will have some functions and types marked as deprecated from storybook directly, but we are not getting any new warning or error, everything still works as usual\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the whole migration take a deep look into \r\nhttps://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-7-0/\r\nor \r\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md\r\n\r\nThese are the main points we changed in order to make this migration, so here are our releases notes:\r\n* [Minimum supported version of node is 16](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#dropped-support-for-node-15-and-below)\r\n* [Start and build CLI binaries removed](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#start-storybook--build-storybook-binaries-removed)\r\n* [<Description /> replaced by <Markdown />](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#description-block-parametersnotes-and-parametersinfo)\r\n* [ArgsTable block](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#argstable-block)\r\n* [Remove color regex from matchers since is conflicting with the colours type on component props, this was leading to a console warning](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls#custom-control-type-matchers)\r\n* [The `subcomponents` annotation is deprecated](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#argstable-block)\r\n* We are still getting some console issues, but those are related with storybook itself and not our implementation, for example https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/23463\r\n* We are still getting some warnings on the Datepicker component, but we created a ticket in order to take care of them in an isolated environment, you can find the ticket [here](https://carlsberggbs.atlassian.net/browse/DSM-824)\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Lint and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] I have updated storybook (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n## Jira Card\r\n\r\n<!-- if no card is associated, remove the line bellow and add \"Not Applicable\" -->\r\n\r\nDSM-775\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carlsberg/malty/issues/782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carlsberg/malty/issues/782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
