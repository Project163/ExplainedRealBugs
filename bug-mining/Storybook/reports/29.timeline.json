Greeting -->\nHi @steciuk! I'm [Dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot) and I’m helping the storybook team.\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThis is a known limitation with Storybook's auto-docs for Svelte (and other frameworks) when using TypeScript utility types like `Omit<>` on `svelte/elements`. When you use utility types, TypeScript flattens the type and erases the original inheritance information, so the docgen tool sees all inherited HTML attributes as direct props and includes them in the props table. In contrast, direct extension or intersection preserves the inheritance context, allowing the docgen tool to filter out inherited attributes as expected. This behavior is not unique to Storybook or Svelte—it's a common issue for docgen tools that rely on TypeScript's output, and there isn't a configuration option or automated workaround in Storybook to filter these out right now [[source](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/32023)].\n\nWorkarounds include manually documenting only the important props using JSDoc comments or Storybook's MDX/DocsPage features, or explicitly redeclaring key props you want to appear in the docs. For more context, you can review the Svelte arg types extraction logic in Storybook's codebase [[source](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/4dad3f978523a5041943697735af2abf72b579c9/code/renderers/svelte/src/extractArgTypes.ts)].\n\n\n<!-- Dosu Comment Footer -->\n*To reply, just mention [@dosu](https://go.dosu.dev/dosubot).*\n\n---\n<sup>How did I do?

Please submit all PRs to the `next` branch unless they are specific to the current release.

For additional guidance: https://storybook.js.org/docs/contribute\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\n\r\nAs described in the issue, when a component's props are defined using a TypeScript utility type like `Omit<HTMLAnchorAttributes, 'children'>`, autodoc fails to identify these props as originating from `svelte/elements`. This causes the automatic documentation to be flooded with all inherited HTML attributes.\r\n\r\nDuring some debugging, I found that for props derived from a utility type, the `prop.valueDeclaration` property is `undefined` and the existing check fails. However, it seems like the TypeScript compiler retains a link to the original type in `prop.links.syntheticOrigin.valueDeclaration`.\r\n\r\nThis PR shows how falling back to this deeper path skips doc generation for inherited props if `prop.valueDeclaration` is not present (at least for basic cases).\r\n\r\nThis is intended merely as a starting point for the discussion, as accessing _internal-looking_ properties like `links.syntheticOrigin` with the mighty help of `as any` probably isn't the best idea. Just thought this may be helpful.\r\n\r\n## Checklist for Contributors\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check (put an \"x\" inside the \"[ ]\") the applicable items below to communicate how to test your changes -->\r\n\r\n#### The changes in this PR are covered in the following automated tests:\r\n\r\n- [ ] stories\r\n- [ ] unit tests\r\n- [ ] integration tests\r\n- [ ] end-to-end tests\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\n_This section is mandatory for all contributions.
