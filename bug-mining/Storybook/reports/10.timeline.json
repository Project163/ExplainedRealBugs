= (typeof sizes)[number];\r\n\r\n// MyComponent.stories.tsx\r\nconst meta: Meta = {\r\n  ...\r\n  argTypes: {\r\n    size: { options: sizes },\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut since the latest version here and release of storybook 8.0.9, now errors with:\r\n```\r\nThe type readonly ['small', 'medium', 'large'] is readonly and cannot be assigned to the mutable type any[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy adding `readonly` to this type, it supports both examples just fine as per
