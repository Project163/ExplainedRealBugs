Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nI'm a mainly a macOS user, but plan on using ArchLinux soon. That's why I'm currently in process of creating [my private Arch User Repository](https://github.com/bartekpacia/aur) (mirroring my [private Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/bartekpacia/homebrew-tools)). However I'm having a problem with storing many packages in the same repo.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nLet's say I have two programs: `fhome` (the client for my smart home) and `fhomed` (the server for my smart home).\r\n\r\nHere's how I define `brews` in my `.goreleaser.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nbrews:\r\n  - name: fhome\r\n    ids:\r\n      - fhome\r\n    repository:\r\n      owner: bartekpacia\r\n      name: homebrew-tools\r\n    folder: Formula\r\n    homepage: https://github.com/bartekpacia/fhome\r\n    description: Interact with smart home devices connected to F&Home\r\n    license: MIT\r\n  - name: fhomed\r\n    # ... doesn't matter\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above creates [a **separate** formula file](https://github.com/bartekpacia/homebrew-tools/blob/master/Formula/fhome.rb), so I can store other formulas in [my `homebrew-tools` repo](https://github.com/bartekpacia/homebrew-tools/blob/master/Formula).\r\n\r\nI wanted to do the same for my `aur`s - that is, have many directories (1 for every package of mine), and a single `PKGBUILD`s inside each of those directories. But I am not able to achieve this – the following `aur` config creates `PKGBUILD` and `.SRCINFO` in the root of my repository:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\naurs:\r\n  - name: fhome-bin\r\n    ids:\r\n      - fhome\r\n    homepage: https://github.com/bartekpacia/fhome\r\n    description: Interact with smart home devices connected to F&Home\r\n    maintainers:\r\n      - Bartek Pacia <barpac02@gmail.com>\r\n    private_key: '{{ .Env.AUR_SSH_KEY }}'\r\n    git_url: git@github.com:bartekpacia/aur.git\r\n\r\n    package: |-\r\n      cd \"$pkgname-$pkgver\"\r\n      # bin\r\n      install -Dm755 fhome \"${pkgdir}/usr/bin/fhome\"\r\n\r\n      # license\r\n      install -Dm644 LICENSE \"${pkgdir}/usr/share/licenses/mybin/LICENSE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here comes my feature requst:\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to specify the directory in which the `PKGBUILD` and `.SRCINFO` files will be created. Idea:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n...\r\nprivate_key: '{{ .Env.AUR_SSH_KEY }}'\r\ngit_url: git@github.com:bartekpacia/aur.git\r\ndirectory: fhome # <-- this would let me store many PKGBUILDs in a single repo\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\r\n\r\n### Supporter\r\n\r\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThanks for this awesome program!","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
