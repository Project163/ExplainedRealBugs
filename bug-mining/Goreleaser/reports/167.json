What happened?\n\nI ran `goreleaser check` as noted on: https://goreleaser.com/deprecations/\r\n\r\nI expected it to report line numbers of my usage of `empty_folders` as I was seeing from my build commands:\r\n```\r\n      • DEPRECATED: 'empty_folders' is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, create content with type 'dir' and directory name as 'dst' instead\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n```\r\n$ goreleaser check -f .goreleaser.yml\r\n\r\n   • loading config file       file=.goreleaser.yml\r\n   • checking config:\r\n   • config is valid\r\n```\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nAdd a config with:\r\n```\r\nnfpms:\r\n- empty_folders:\r\n  - /foo/bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `goreleaser check`\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\ngoreleaser --version\r\ngoreleaser version 1.8.3\r\ncommit: 63436392db6ac0557513535fc3ee4223a44810ed\r\nbuilt by: homebrew\r\ngoos: darwin\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nTried `goreleaser check --debug` too, nothing interesting there.","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
