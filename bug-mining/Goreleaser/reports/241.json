What happened?\n\nIn the last version, the following source archive is not added to the list of artifacts because `len(ctx.Config.Source.Files) == 0`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsource:\r\n  enabled: true\r\n  rlcp: true\r\n  name_template: \"{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be these lines\r\nhttps://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/ffefd6c4ae257d2e9aeccb5786ba66401cc1bd78/internal/pipe/sourcearchive/source.go#L64-L66\r\n\r\nAdded in a recent commit https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/0eb3e7975c7a134713c7e377dcb8696cb0294357\r\n\r\nAdding a file in the `files` property works properly, the file cannot be present in the archive and needs to be in the .gitignore, if not you will get the dirty git state error.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nRun `goreleaser release --clean --skip-publish --debug` on a file with a source archive:\r\n\r\nYou are supposed to see something like this:\r\n```\r\n  • creating source archive\r\n    • creating source archive                        file=foo_0.25.0.tar.gz\r\n    • running git                                    args=[-c log.showSignature=false archive -o dist/foo_0.25.0.tar.gz 1434cdcc350ace025abfd12c13eea25d521cdbc0]\r\n    • git result                                     stderr= stdout=\r\n    • copying file                                   dst=dist/foo_0.25.0.tar.gz.bkp src=dist/foo_0.25.0.tar.gz\r\n    • added new artifact                             name=foo_0.25.0.tar.gz path=dist/foo_0.25.0.tar.gz type=Source\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd instead, you see:\r\n```\r\n  • creating source archive\r\n    • creating source archive                        file=foo_0.24.0.tar.gz\r\n    • running git                                    args=[-c log.showSignature=false archive -o dist/step-ca_0.24.0.tar.gz 1434cdcc350ace025abfd12c13eea25d521cdbc0]\r\n    • git result                                     stderr= stdout=\r\n```\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n$ goreleaser --version\r\ngoreleaser version 1.17.0\r\ncommit:
