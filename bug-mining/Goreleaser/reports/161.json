I just only want release notes. I set `release.disabled=true` according to documentation [here](https://goreleaser.com/customization/release/#gitlab). It says\r\n\r\n> You can disable this pipe in order to not upload any artifacts.\r\n\r\nBut it didn't work as expected and I saw the related code [here](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/main/internal/pipe/release/release.go#L26). Clearly, if you set `release.disabled=true` you can't get any release. \r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nrelease:\r\n    disable: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nv1.7.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nCC: @yilmazo","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
