uses examples in Markdown in the release notes, one example:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"{{ replace .TranslationBaseName \"-\" \" \" | title }}\"\r\ndate: {{ .Date }}\r\ndraft: true\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Insert Lead paragraph here.**\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n## New Cool Posts\r\n\r\n{{ range first 10 ( where .Site.RegularPages \"Type\" \"cool\" ) }}\r\n* {{ .Title }}\r\n{{ end }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince goreleaser uses `html/template` to handle these release notes, it escapes the brackets and quotes in the above example, and I have to manually edit the release notes to make it look right.\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is a specific reason why not to just use `text/template` here, which, for us, would be a better
