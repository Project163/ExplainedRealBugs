Please describe.\n\nGithub recently added a new feature called \"Artifact Attestations\". From what I can tell, it isn't straightforward to integrate this feature with Goreleaser.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nGithub recently introduced native integration of sigstore signatures. They're calling this \"Artifact Attestations\". It would be very cool if Goreleaser supported automatic artifact attestations for all release artifacts. Or at least documented the recommended integration approach.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nGoreleaser already supports signing various artifacts using sigstore's cosign. However checking signatures is not straightforward and requires a fairly complex cosign command.\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4852/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
