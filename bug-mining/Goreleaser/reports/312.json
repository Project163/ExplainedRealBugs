Please describe.\r\n\r\nI'm using goreleaser to create a homebrew tap where the source repository and its releases are private. Therefore, I currently cannot use the generated tap, as the urls require authentication:\r\n```\r\n==> Downloading https://github.com/thde/..._0.1.1_darwin_arm64.tar.gz\r\ncurl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nHomebrew allows to specify custom headers for download urls as suggested as a solution for this by a Homebrew maintainer.
