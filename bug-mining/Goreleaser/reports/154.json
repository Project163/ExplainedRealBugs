This causes syntax errors and the formula does not install properly.\r\n\r\nIf your goreleaser config has the following:\r\n```yml\r\n...\r\nbrews:\r\n    ...\r\n    post_install: |\r\n        etc.install \"config1.conf\"\r\n        etc.install \"config2.conf\"\r\n        etc.install \"config3.conf\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated formula outputs the following:\r\n```rb\r\n...\r\n  def post_install\r\n    etc.install \"config1.conf\"\r\netc.install \"config2.conf\"\r\netc.install \"config3.conf\"\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of the expected:\r\n```rb\r\n...\r\n  def post_install\r\n    etc.install \"config1.conf\"\r\n    etc.install \"config2.conf\"\r\n    etc.install \"config3.conf\"\r\n  end\r\n```\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nYou can just create a goreleaser config with multiple lines in the `brews.post_install`\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\ngoreleaser version 1.6.3\r\ncommit: 42258cf4733a9f42b17ad1b47fb7e6e2a10369c0\r\nbuilt at: 2022-03-12T01:23:19Z\r\nbuilt by: goreleaser\r\ngoos: linux\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.6.3, checksum: h1:LqHfNmaqGoC7OuabK/UeINWyuQaqm/jdotsALhk0zsE=\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
