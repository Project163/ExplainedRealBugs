might be a stupid question, but is it possible to use goreleaser without the build step? \r\n\r\nI've stumbled accross this project, as I have multiple projects for which I want to create a new release on a regular basis. Most of the projects are dockerized - i.e there exists a `Dockerfile` which contains all the necessary dependencies and compiles the go application during the build step. \r\n\r\nAs everything is already done within the Dockerfile, I do not need an additional build step. So what I would need is just the \"release functionality\" of goreleaser. \r\n\r\nEverything I tried to so far ended in an error similar to this one here: https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/694\r\n\r\nIs that somehow possible to accomplish?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3784400654,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3ODQ0MDA2NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/3784400654","actor":{"login":"mohammed90","id":2636183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzYxODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2636183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90","html_url":"https://github.com/mohammed90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammed90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5734366c54919f927febc33aec0147f4a861a79d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hacdias/webdav/commits/5734366c54919f927febc33aec0147f4a861a79d","created_at":"2020-09-18T22:13:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/730060649","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/694#issuecomment-730060649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/694","id":730060649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDA2MDY0OQ==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-19T01:19:56Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T01:19:56Z","body":"This issue has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
