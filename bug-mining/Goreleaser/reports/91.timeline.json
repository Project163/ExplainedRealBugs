`homebrew-tap` repo and removed the deprecation notices.\r\n\r\nI then set the `custom_require` config value in my `.goreleaser.yml`:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nbrew:\r\n  github:\r\n    owner: foo\r\n    name: homebrew-tap\r\n\r\n  # Allows you to set a custom download strategy.\r\n  download_strategy: GitHubPrivateRepositoryReleaseDownloadStrategy\r\n\r\n  # Allows you to add a custom require_relative at the top of the formula template\r\n  custom_require: \"../custom_download_strategy\"\r\n\r\n  # Folder inside the repository to put the formula.\r\n  folder: Formula\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is working pretty nicely!\r\n\r\n@caarlos0 perhaps we just need to update the docs at https://goreleaser.com/homebrew/ and not necessarily include the download strategies here but point to them
