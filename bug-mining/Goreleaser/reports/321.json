What happened?\n\nWith a config file like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nrelease:\r\n  skip_upload: true\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n.. when I run `goreleaser release --clean` it doesn't upload the artifact, but neither the git tag created.\r\n\r\nMy expectation is that it doesn't upload the artifact, but the tag just created should be pushed!\r\n\r\nAfter I removed `skip_upload: true` everything works again: git tag is pushed, but also the artifact.\r\nI have the feeling this is something changed in the last week or so.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\n`goreleaser release
