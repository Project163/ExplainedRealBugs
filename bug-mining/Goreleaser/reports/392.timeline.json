with it a bit, and it's pretty much what you did indeed.\r\n\r\nI think this issue is documentation enough of it for now, will add a blog post in the future if needed.\r\n\r\nBut, basically:\r\n\r\n- give the workflow the `attestations: write` permission\r\n- use the `actions/attest-build-provenance` action (can set `subject-path: dist/*` for example)\r\n- if using docker images or manifests, you'll also need to use `jq` to get the digests and names of them from the `artifacts.json` that the goreleaser-action produces\r\n  - this might require more fiddling with than the snipped provided by @smlx if you have more images\r\n- in the same token, you might attest SBOMs too, you can use the `actions/attest-sbom` action for this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntldr, besides fiddling with `jq`, pretty much can follow this: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds

[multiple.intoto.jsonl](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua/releases/download/v2.34.0/multiple.intoto.jsonl)\r\n\r\nSo users can install aqua securely using Cosign and slsa-verifier.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier\r\n\r\nAnd `aqua update-aqua` and `aqua-installer` have already used them.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-installer\r\n\r\nBut GitHub Artifact Attestations still has some benefits.\r\n\r\n- The verification command is simpler than Cosign and slsa-verifier\r\n- You don't need to know about Cosign and slsa-verifier\r\n- You don't need to install Cosign and slsa-verifier\r\n- GitHub Artifact Attestations is GitHub's official feature and has the potential to spread\n\n### Example Code\n\n_No response_\n\n### Note\n\nslsa-github-generator and GoReleaser don't support GitHub Artifact Attestations natively, but they have issues about it.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/issues/3618\r\n- https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4852\r\n\r\nI think we may create GitHub Artifact Attestations using GitHub CLI
