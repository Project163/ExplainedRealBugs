Please describe.\r\n\r\nI know there is the `archlinux` format for `nfpms`.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I removed the previous description because I was misled by my own commit message error... Sorry.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nCurrently, only pre-compiled packages (`-bin`) are supported.\r\n\r\nI think it's possible to use the [source archive](https://goreleaser.com/customization/source/) to create a package from sources.\r\n\r\nAs a user should respect the difference between `-bin` or not, I think a new \"type\" can be introduced to be sure that only sources are used in this context.\r\n\r\nSomething like that:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\naurs:\r\n  -\r\n    git_url: \"ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/foo-bin.git\"\r\n    # ...\r\n  -\r\n    git_url: \"ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/foo.git\"\r\n    type: \"source\"\r\n    # ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```go\r\nctx.Artifacts.Filter(artifact.ByType(artifact.UploadableSourceArchive))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, some extra configurations can be required:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\naurs:\r\n  -\r\n    git_url: \"ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/foo.git\"\r\n    type: \"source\"\r\n    # ...\r\n    makedepends: ...\r\n    prepare: ...\r\n    build: ...\r\n    package: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nref: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Creating_packages\r\n\r\nThis is just a raw idea, and I don't know the architecture of goreleaser, maybe there is a better way than the `type` field.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nUses `archlinux` format?\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\r\n\r\n### Supporter\r\n\r\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nTo be able to publish automatically [nfpm](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nfpm) and [nfpm-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nfpm-bin).","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
