guys, totally get uname concept and get discussion!  From that it led me to understand the bug better.   I'll comment on defaults separately.\r\n\r\nI think the \"bug\" (feature?) I bumped into is this:\r\n\r\nIf you *do not* use any archive/replacements, everything defaults to uname values.  That's what goreleaser is doing.  All good.\r\n\r\nIf you add *one* entry to archive/replacements, everything defaults to GOOS values.  Even for things you didn't specify.   \r\n\r\nHere's my experiment:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/client9/misspell/blob/master/goreleaser.yml\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# goreleaser.yml\r\n\r\nbuild:\r\n  main: cmd/misspell/main.go\r\n  binary: misspell\r\n  goos:\r\n    - darwin\r\n    - linux\r\n  goarch:\r\n    - amd64\r\n  env:\r\n    - CGO_ENABLED=0\r\n  ignore:\r\n    - goos: darwin\r\n      goarch: 386\r\n\r\narchive:\r\n  name_template: \"{{.Binary}}_{{.Version}}_{{.Os}}_{{.Arch}}\"\r\n\r\n  replacements:\r\n    amd64: 64-bit\r\n    386: 32-bit\r\n    darwin: macOS\r\n\r\nsnapshot:\r\n  name_template: SNAPSHOT-{{.Commit}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how I'm *not* specifying anything for `linux` in the `replacements` section.\r\n\r\nbut Yet...  here are my releases:   GOOS `linux` lower case.\r\n\r\na62640e4122a033cf4098d2de41dc335a8ad708b668ed41ac9a1304848fb8f57  misspell_0.1.0_linux_64-bit.tar.gz\r\n5189df7b59e54a8439324eab7da6cbd708ca724b287c432dc950788de384cfb5  misspell_0.1.0_macOS_64-bit.tar.gz\r\n\r\nThat doesn't seem right.  If you want to change one default, you really have to change defaults for every possible value.\r\n\r\nI thin hugo bumped into this which is why their replacements sections is
