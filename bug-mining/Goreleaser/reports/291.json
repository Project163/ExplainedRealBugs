What happened?\n\n**What happened**\r\nI'm wanting to only build one target that doesn't get published. To do this, I'm using the following\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 goreleaser build --clean --snapshot --single-target\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that this should clean out the dist folder and then build a single binary for linux amd64 without using a git tag. Instead, it's still building a binary for all platforms\r\n\r\n```\r\n  • starting build...\r\n  • loading                                          path=.goreleaser.yaml\r\n  • building only for linux/amd64                    reason=single target is enabled\r\n  • skipping validate...\r\n  • loading environment variables\r\n  • getting and validating git state\r\n    • ignoring errors because this is a snapshot     error=git doesn't contain any tags. Either add a tag or use --snapshot\r\n    • git state                                      commit=d4b5de7509de37b868a8051e090fed22e5d1cbcf branch=CI current_tag=v0.0.0 previous_tag=<unknown> dirty=false\r\n    • pipe skipped                                   reason=disabled during snapshot mode\r\n  • parsing tag\r\n  • setting defaults\r\n  • snapshotting\r\n    • building snapshot...                           version=0.0.0-d4b5de7\r\n  • checking distribution directory\r\n    • cleaning dist\r\n  • loading go mod information\r\n  • build prerequisites\r\n  • writing effective config file\r\n    • writing                                        config=dist/config.yaml\r\n  • building binaries\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/windows_386/binary.exe\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/linux_amd64_v1/binary\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/linux_386/binary\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/linux_arm64/binary\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/darwin_amd64_v1/binary\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/darwin_arm64/binary\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/windows_arm64/binary.exe\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/windows_amd64_v1/binary.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What I expected to happen**\r\nOnly the binary for linux amd64 should've been built\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nI'm running ubuntu 22.04 and using goreleaser from snap. I use the following command\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 goreleaser build --clean --snapshot --single-target\r\n```\r\n\r\nUltimately, this will be running an ubuntu 22.04 image in CI which downloads goreleaser as part of a goreleaser action. I'm getting the same behavior in CI.\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n1.22.0\r\n\r\nI just checked in CI and 1.21.2 works as expected\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
