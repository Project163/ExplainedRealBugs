Please describe.**\r\nIt's not exactly straight forward to install goreleaser and use it in GitLab CI. I wouldn't opt for this - https://goreleaser.com/ci/#gitlab-ci\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA solution that allows me to use goreleaser in my GitLab Ci with a simple config such as this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrelease-job:\r\n  image: some-image\r\n  stage: publish\r\n  only:\r\n    - tags\r\n  script:\r\n    - goreleaser release\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut currently the image `goreleaser/goreleaser` cannot be used in the image field as it has an entrypoint, so gitlab errors with the error \r\n\r\n```\r\ngoreleaser: error: unexpected sh, try --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently I use the below script to install goreleaser and then run it using the gitlab ci config I mentioned. \r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\nset -ex\r\n\r\npackage_name=\"goreleaser/goreleaser\"\r\n\r\nget_latest_release() {\r\n  curl \"https://api.github.com/repos/$package_name/releases/latest\" | grep '\"tag_name\":' | sed -E 's/.*\"([^\"]+)\".*/\\1/'\r\n}\r\n\r\nlatest_version=$(get_latest_release)\r\necho $latest_version\r\n\r\necho \"Installing goreleaser${latest_version}\"\r\nwget \"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/download/$latest_version/goreleaser_Linux_arm64.tar.gz\"\r\n\r\ntar -xvzf goreleaser_Linux_arm64.tar.gz\r\nmv goreleaser /usr/local/bin/\r\n\r\necho \"goreleaser has been installed:\"\r\ngoreleaser version\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome pros of providing script:\r\n1. Install goreleaser in any docker image easily\r\n\r\nAlternative solution ideas:\r\nI would expect a script to install goreleaser or provide an image that doesn't have an entrypoint. This will make the user experience better\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
