main use case for GoReleaser seems to be running it via CI for Git tags only.\r\nHowever, nothing stops you from running it on any other branch.\r\n\r\nBy running it on another branch GoReleaser still uses the latest Git tag to name the release, \r\nbut for building it actually uses the source of the current active branch (if I don't miss anything here?).\r\nAlso, it's not possible to create a release that doesn't depend on a Git tag.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to either always use the source of the latest tag\r\nor to allow releasing without a relation to Git tags.\r\n\r\nThe first solution would require to get the source from the tag for building or to only allow building when the current branch is the latest tag.\r\n\r\nThe second solution would need more thinking about other scenarios for releasing Go projects.","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/72/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/72/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
