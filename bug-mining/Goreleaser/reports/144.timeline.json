Bug description\r\nThe build toolchain and ppa packages tells it supports `armhf` which on debian seems to be `arm6` and `arm7` (_...don't ask me why_).\r\nBut when building for `armhf` (32bit arm), it was compiling `armv7l` binaries for `armv6l`, causing myst executable to crash with `\"fatal error illegal instruction\"`.\r\n\r\nThis same problem/bug happened on this other project: https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2721\r\nSo my solution was lightly inspired on it.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nGot it working on my _raspbery pizero W_, with both \r\n - directly running `./myst` binaries (dynamic and static compilation)\r\n - generating `.deb` package and installing it\r\n\r\nIt was crosscompiled from a linux x86_64 machine.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nCurrently this PR is incomplete and can only generate the\r\n - `armv6` binaries (see `buildBinaryFor()` and `packageStandalone()` changes)\r\n - `.deb` package (see `PackageLinuxDebianArmv6l()` changes)\r\n - static build binaries (see `PackageLinuxArmv6l()` changes)\r\n \r\nIt didn't know what more needed to be refactored, since i don´t know how what happens after artifacts gets uploaded to S3 bucket.\r\n\r\nSo any assistance is welcome.\r\nAlso feel free to reach on discord, i'm on the mysterium-network channel!

Still the case in April 2025.\n\n---\n\nRelated:\n- https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues/2348\n- https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues/2085#issuecomment-1327494298\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nGHCR and DockerHub registries should be publishing the same image builds.\n\n**Actual behavior**\n\n```console\n# Different images:\ndocker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock wagoodman/dive docker.io/drwetter/testssl.sh:3.2\ndocker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock wagoodman/dive ghcr.io/testssl/testssl.sh:3.2\n```\n\nYour DockerHub and GHCR publishing seems to be handled differently? You have a Github Actions workflow for the GHCR registry, but it's targeting the `Dockerfile.git` (Old Alpine) image in the 3.2 branch:\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/.github/workflows/docker-3.2.yml#L55\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/.github/workflows/docker-3.2.yml#L61-L63\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/Dockerfile.git#L3\n\nDockerHub is apparently watching the repo and builds automatically (_thus the `Dockerfile` used [from each branch associated to a tag?](https://hub.docker.com/r/drwetter/testssl.sh/tags)_): https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues/2085#issuecomment-1327494298\n\n---\n\nThis file was only added AFAIK for CI usage, where it builds differently by performing a `git clone` of the repo instead of using `COPY`:\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/Dockerfile.git#L14\n\nAllowing via build `ARG` to control the repo and branch (_`ARCHIVE_URL` doesn't appear to be used_):\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/Dockerfile.git#L7-L9\n\nThe CI itself is only using the build version:\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/.github/workflows/docker-3.2.yml#L57\n\n---\n\nThere is rarely a need for this style of image building?\n- Usually any fork of `testssl.sh` is going to also have the `Dockerfile` associated to it.\n- This would just be building with the source a remote of a repo + branch where you don't want to use the `Dockerfile` in sync with that commit?\n- What advantage / need does it serve over a local `git clone` and building from the `Dockerfile` in that repo?\n\nIIRC, it was possibly used in the past to have the CI support building the different branches of this project. However the CI should be triggered and building with the correct branch source here?:\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/.github/workflows/docker-3.2.yml#L21-L22\n\n**EDIT:** You've been reluctant to remove it because of the [possibility of someone else building from it](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/pull/2347#issuecomment-1481040403). There is ~~no other known~~ consumer beyond the CI, I'd encourage dropping it until you have a valid reason to keep it (_revert the removal and address the image changes required at that point_).\n\nI am aware of one user @jauderho that would need to update [their workflow](https://github.com/jauderho/dockerfiles/blob/6cb7bbfc0c03391ef94d04eeacb0952794763907/.github/workflows/testssl.sh.yml#L123), should the file be dropped. Perhaps they can weigh in on if that'd be an issue for them.\n\n---\n\nLikewise you have for both `3.0` and `3.2` these branch triggers, both with scheduled `cron` jobs:\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/b21c5ee7805630738a2f0253632fed0b3f1a4c06/.github/workflows/docker-3.2.yml#L3-L9\n\nhttps://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/blob/ece9447ac4a9d5ae4a594744339734480f2f50ea/.github/workflows/docker-3.0.yml#L3-L9\n\nHowever scheduled workflows are only from the default branch (now `3.2`): https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/actions/workflows/docker-3.2.yml\n\nAs you'll see no scheduled builds are in the `3.0` history for the past year: https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/actions/workflows/docker-3.0.yml\n\nYou could [adapt the scheduled workflow of `docker-mailserver`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/blob/82c38f242648290ab109de8e3994ea7564120deb/.github/workflows/scheduled_builds.yml), which references a workflow to run and the associated branch (`@`).\n\nThat lives on the default branch, and without providing a branch reference, will run the referenced workflow from that scheduled run workflows last commit (_not what you want when referencing workflows to run that get updated_), thus referencing the branch is important.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testssl/testssl.sh/issues/2422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testssl/testssl.sh/issues/2422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"polarathene","id":5098581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTg1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5098581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene","html_url":"https://github.com/polarathene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/polarathene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-01T07:44:18Z","updated_at":"2025-05-01T07:44:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/chisel/issues/223","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/chisel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/chisel/issues/223/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/chisel/issues/223/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/chisel/issues/223/events","html_url":"https://github.com/canonical/chisel/issues/223","id":3033356547,"node_id":"I_kwDOHYnVdM60zVkD","number":223,"title":"Better

Have `chisel cut --arch` map/normalize [BuildKit supplied platform `ARG`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#automatic-platform-args-in-the-global-scope)s to the appropriate `--arch` value, making cross-platform builds much simpler with `docker build --platform` (_which is commonly used on GH CI with `docker/build-push-action`_):\n\n```bash\n# Creating a container driver for Buildx to build with:\ndocker buildx create --name=container --driver=docker-container --bootstrap --use\n\n# Now we can build multiple platforms concurrently:\ndocker buildx build \\\n  --builder=container \\\n  --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm/v6,linux/386,linux/ppc64le \\\n  --tag localhost/testssl \\\n  .\n```\n\n---\n\n## Problem and workarounds\n\nUsing `chisel` to get packages for a different arch is fairly [simple with `chisel cut --arch`](https://github.com/canonical/chisel/issues/129) (_provided you know what the supported architecture values look like, otherwise for the unfamiliar there's ab it more legwork to search that up_).\n\nHowever, I recently looked into [building a multi-arch image with Chisel beyond the common `amd64`/`arm64` archs](https://github.com/testssl/testssl.sh/issues/2422#issuecomment-2841813704), and encountered a few points of friction.\n\nWhile `chisel cut --arch` maps to the same archs that Ubuntu repos use:\n- The [GH Releases](https://github.com/canonical/chisel/releases/tag/v1.1.0) omit several of those archs, so you cannot pull from there for a convenient executable when building non-native arch images by using `TARGETARCH` with the default `docker build` behaviour emulating that target arch.\n\n    ```Dockerfile\n    # NOTE: This will be redundant once an official chisel image is released:\n    FROM alpine AS chisel\n    ARG CHISEL_VERSION=1.1.0\n    ARG TARGETARCH\n    ARG CHISEL_RELEASE=\"https://github.com/canonical/chisel/releases/download/v${CHISEL_VERSION}/chisel_v${CHISEL_VERSION}_linux_${TARGETARCH}.tar.gz\"\n    RUN wget -qO - \"${CHISEL_RELEASE}\" | tar -xz --no-same-owner -C /usr/local/bin chisel\n    ```\n\n  While this is typically slower, it does infer the platform arch emulated for `chisel cut`, removing any need for an explicit `--arch`. That's useful because of the next point..\n- `chisel cut --arch` does not map `TARGETARCH` (or related `ARG` from BuildKit) to the repo architectures expected / supported.\n\n  `TARGETARCH` can be `arm`, which matches the GH release arch. But that is presumably `armhf` (`arm/v7`), since unlike Debian, Ubuntu only has support for that arch. The legacy `armel` (`arm/v6`) would still be `arm` for `TARGETARCH`, you need to pair it with `TARGETVARIANT` to get the `v7` vs `v6` distinction. Regardless, these `ARG` values do not match the `apt` repo arch, so some logic is now required to map between the two.\n\n  Similar story for `ppc64le` => `ppc64el` and `386` => `i386`.\n\n  So we end up with something like this:\n\n  1. Use `--platform=${BUILDPLATFORM}` to only use a base image native to your build host for all targets, and likewise only pull a compatible binary for that (_`BASEARCH` instead of `TARGETARCH`_) which won't be required once there is an official chisel image.\n\n      ```Dockerfile\n      # NOTE: This will be redundant once an official chisel image is released:\n      FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM} alpine AS chisel\n      ARG CHISEL_VERSION=1.1.0\n      ARG BUILDARCH\n      ARG CHISEL_RELEASE=\"https://github.com/canonical/chisel/releases/download/v${CHISEL_VERSION}/chisel_v${CHISEL_VERSION}_linux_${BUILDARCH}.tar.gz\"\n      RUN wget -qO - \"${CHISEL_RELEASE}\" | tar -xz --no-same-owner -C /usr/local/bin chisel\n      ```\n\n  2. Map platforms to package arch:\n\n      ```Dockerfile\n      # Workaround - Performance improvement (avoid emulation for non-native image builds)\n      # Map TARGETPLATFORM from BuildKit to equivalent input for `chisel cut --arch`:\n      FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM} alpine AS chisel-arch-target\n      ARG TARGETPLATFORM\n      RUN <<HEREDOC\n        case \"${TARGETPLATFORM}\" in\n          ( 'linux/amd64' )\n            echo 'amd64' > /target-arch.txt\n            ;;\n          ( 'linux/arm64' )\n            echo 'arm64' > /target-arch.txt\n            ;;\n          ( 'linux/arm/v7' )\n            echo 'armhf' > /target-arch.txt\n            ;;\n          ( 'linux/arm/v6' )\n            # NOTE: This presumably isn't reliable and should be `armel` (if Ubuntu supported it):\n            echo 'armhf' > /target-arch.txt\n            ;;\n          ( 'linux/386' )\n            echo 'i386' > /target-arch.txt\n            ;;\n          ( 'linux/ppc64le' )\n            echo 'ppc64el' > /target-arch.txt\n            ;;\n          ( * )\n            echo \"ERROR: Unsupported target platform: '${TARGETPLATFORM}'\"\n            return 1\n            ;;\n        esac\n      HEREDOC\n      ```\n  \n      or alternatively:\n  \n      ```Dockerfile\n      # The suffix matches TARGETARCH + TARGETVARIANT\n      # TARGETPLATFORM is not valid in the stage name due to presence of `/`\n      FROM chisel AS chisel-amd64\n      ENV CHISEL_ARCH=amd64\n      FROM chisel AS chisel-arm64\n      ENV CHISEL_ARCH=arm64\n      FROM chisel AS chisel-armv7\n      ENV CHISEL_ARCH=armhf\n      FROM chisel AS chisel-armv6\n      ENV CHISEL_ARCH=armel\n      FROM chisel AS chisel-386\n      ENV CHISEL_ARCH=i386\n      FROM chisel AS chisel-ppc64le\n      ENV CHISEL_ARCH=ppc64el\n      ```\n\n  3. Have `chisel cut --arch` access that arch value from `/target-arch.txt`:\n\n      ```Dockerfile\n      # Prepare root-fs with required packages:\n      FROM chisel AS root-fs\n      COPY --link --from=chisel-arch-target /target-arch.txt /target-arch.txt\n      WORKDIR /root-fs\n      RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/.cache/chisel,id=\"chisel-cache\" \\\n          chisel cut --arch \"$(cat /target-arch.txt)\" --release ubuntu-24.04 --root /root-fs \\\n              base-files_base bash_bins\n      ```\n  \n      or with alternative pulling in the appropriate stage for the correct `CHISEL_ARCH` ENV:\n  \n      ```Dockerfile\n      # Prepare root-fs with required packages:\n      FROM chisel-${TARGETARCH}${TARGETVARIANT} AS root-fs\n      WORKDIR /root-fs\n      RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/.cache/chisel,id=\"chisel-cache\" \\\n          chisel cut --arch \"${CHISEL_ARCH?arch-required}\" --release ubuntu-24.04 --root /root-fs \\\n              base-files_base bash_bins\n      ```\n\nYou can now build for `i386` (_and for `armhf` & `ppc64el` more performantly_), but it's awkward (_I don't personally need this, but the referenced project was reluctant to drop supporting it_).\n\n---\n\nThis is something that could be improved on, so that examples [like I showed here](https://github.com/canonical/chisel/issues/157#issuecomment-2333426100) would work as intended without that mapping workaround demonstrated above.\n\n`chisel cut --arch` should ideally recognize `TARGETPLATFORM` and `TARGETARCH` to normalize/map to the equivalent `--arch` value supported, or fail early when that is not a valid/supported arch (if possible). Should `chisel` support alternative distros/repos like Debian or Fedora, this may be less straight-forward and need some config support at that point to support specifying the appropriate mappings?\n\n[Raspbian apparently considers `armhf` as `arm/v6`](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2721#issuecomment-985552594), I've also seen on DockerHub where Debian and openSUSE Leap images archs differ a bit, `linux/arm` seems to resolve to the lowest supported variant, so if both armv6 and armv7 are published you'd get armv6 (openSUSE Leap is known for this with 15.5 at least), Debian I've seen only publishes `linux/arm/v5` and `linux/arm/v7`, where pulling a `linux/arm/v6` gets you the `linux/arm/v5` platform image (_which Raspbian also considers as `armel`_).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/chisel/issues/223/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canonical/chisel/issues/223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
