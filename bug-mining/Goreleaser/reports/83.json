I run `make release-prerelease`. When I do, it creates a github release, but does not mark it as a pre-release.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect that it will be a pre-release\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: mac\r\n- OS version: Darwin CZIPA1OSX149.local 18.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.2.0: Fri Oct  5 19:41:49 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4903.221.2~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n\r\n- GoReleaser Version: 0.95.2, commit 47f1fd81ea544f3197eff92f68d9a7a600cb4e34, built at 2018-12-28T22:24:11Z\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/917/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
