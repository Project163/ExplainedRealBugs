What happened?\n\nI noticed that the generated archive contained entries with both `root` and local-user owners.\r\n\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nCheckout goreleaser at a recent commit, e.g. 17a955458ca085b010a75127d2a0572ea89d22eb, and run goreleaser on itself:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser.git\r\n...\r\n$ cd goreleaser\r\n$ git checkout 17a955458ca085b010a75127d2a0572ea89d22eb\r\n...\r\n$ go run . release --clean --snapshot --skip=chocolatey,sign,publish,sbom,docker\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen inspect the contents of `dist/goreleaser_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ tar tvzf dist/goreleaser_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz                                  \r\n-rw-rw-r-- twp/twp        1085 2024-08-17 09:19 LICENSE.md\r\n-rw-rw-r-- twp/twp       12982 2024-08-17 09:19 README.md\r\n-rw-rw-r-- twp/twp       11975 2024-08-17 18:10 completions/goreleaser.bash\r\n-rw-rw-r-- twp/twp       10061 2024-08-17

manpages/goreleaser.1.gz\r\n-rwxrwxr-x root/root  66003096 2024-08-16 19:49 goreleaser\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `goreleaser` entry is owned by `root/root`, whereas all other entries are owned by the local user (`twp/twp` in my case).\r\n\r\n\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n17a955458ca085b010a75127d2a0572ea89d22eb\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nRunning `go releaser check` warns about goreleaser's own `.goreleaser.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ go run . check\r\n  • checking                                 path=.goreleaser.yaml\r\n  • DEPRECATED:  snapshot.name_template  should not be used anymore, check https://goreleaser.com/deprecations#snapshotnametemplate for more info\r\n  • .goreleaser.yaml                                 error=configuration is valid, but uses deprecated properties\r\n  ⨯ command failed                                   error=1 out of 1 configuration file(s) have issues\r\nexit status 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I had to check the \"goreleaser check shows no errors\" checkbox to be able to submit this issue.","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5086/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
