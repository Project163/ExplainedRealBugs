Please describe.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to conditionally create a draft release with GoReleaser in my GitHub workflow. I tried using the `--draft` flag with the `goreleaser release` command, but I got an `unknown flag: --draft` error message. This prevents me from creating draft releases conditionally based on the tag name (e.g. `alpha`, `beta`).\r\n\r\nHere's the GitHub workflow example:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ngoreleaser:\r\n  name: GoReleaser\r\n  if: github.ref_type == 'tag'\r\n  needs: [lint, check-deps, tests]\r\n  environment: github-releases\r\n  permissions:\r\n    contents: write\r\n  env:\r\n    DRAFT: ${{ contains(github.ref, 'alpha') || contains(github.ref, 'beta') }}\r\n  runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n  steps:\r\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\r\n      with:\r\n        fetch-depth: 0\r\n\r\n    - uses: actions/setup-go@v5\r\n      with:\r\n        go-version: stable\r\n\r\n    - name: Run GoReleaser\r\n      uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@7ec5c2b0c6cdda6e8bbb49444bc797dd33d74dd8 # v5.0.0\r\n      with:\r\n        version: latest\r\n        args: release --clean --draft ${{ env.DRAFT }}\r\n      env:\r\n        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, the only way to create a draft release now is to set the `draft` field to `true` in the `.goreleaser.yml` file.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like the `--draft` flag to be recognized by the `goreleaser release` command.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\r\n\r\n### Supporter\r\n\r\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4767/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
