your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI do release-candidate releases. It would be nice if people could install them using homebrew.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install [...] --devel\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is currently already sort-of doable using the `custom_block` directive but it would be nicer if this happened automatically based on the `release.prerelease` directive.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIf a prerelease is detected (based on `release.prerelease`) the brew pipeline should **not** update the main portion of the formula. Instead it should add a `devel` section as described here: https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#devel. The rest of the formula should not change (i.e. it should still point to the previous stable version).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIf the location of the build artifacts is already known, one can do a normal release and add the pre-release artifacts using the `custom_block` directive. This is tricky because it means:\r\n\r\n1. the artifacts need to get created upfront\r\n2. need to convince goreleaser to re-publish the brew formula for the latest stable version with the new pre-release version without re-publishing the stable version (there are flags to disable things, not sure if they are enough)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1488/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/729873035","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1772#issuecomment-729873035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1772","id":729873035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTg3MzAzNQ==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-18T18:32:10Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T18:32:10Z","body":"This issue has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
