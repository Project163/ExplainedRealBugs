I was following the docs from https://goreleaser.com/customization/release/ \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  # Set this to true if you want to disable just the artifact upload to the SCM.\r\n  # If this is true, GoReleaser will still create the release with the changelog, but won't upload anything to it.\r\n  #\r\n  # Defaults to false.\r\n  skip_upload: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd was confused on why the latest release [v1.10.3]( https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/tag/v1.10.3) was giving an error:\r\n```console\r\n> goreleaser release --snapshot --rm-dist\r\n  • starting release...\r\n  • loading config file                              file=.goreleaser.yaml\r\n  ⨯ release failed after 0s                  error=yaml: unmarshal errors:\r\n  line 55: field skip_upload not found in type config.Release\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\nI think the feature #3282 where the `skip_upload` was implemented is slated for v1.11.0. This confusion can be avoided by having a versioned doc. For example https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ vs https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\n1. `goreleaser init` to produce `goreleaser.yaml`\r\n2. Edit add a `release.skip_upload: true` entry to the YAML above\r\n3. Run `goreleaser check`\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n> goreleaser --version\r\ngoreleaser version 1.10.3\r\ncommit: 315935aedc9908b078ae525b33ddb42b2fafcc54\r\nbuilt at: 2022-07-27T12:55:55Z\r\nbuilt by: goreleaser\r\ngoos: darwin\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.10.3, checksum: h1:mNSqSgqOwCyJCEmL35aDvGsZaucKF9yQyARxznqCtDM=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [ ] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nAwesome tool.
