Of course, you can also install it locally if you\r\n       wish.\r\n\r\n       You can also customize your entire release process through a\r\n\r\n       single .goreleaser.yaml file.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the [long description](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/a5d3e7bf4b061d2ea58a4e8a6b3f242844a747fd/cmd/root.go#L57) has hard line breaks but the package you use to generate a man page from that takes any line break to mean a paragraph break.
