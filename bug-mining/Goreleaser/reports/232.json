Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n\r\nI have a goreleaser setup that pushes docker images and manifest lists on tag builds AND on builds of certain branches (e.g. our `main` branch).  To do this successfully for branches, I need to disable the changelog and release configurations. But I still want to publish docker images and docker manifests.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI see that as of #3710, I can now template `release.disable` to use something like `{{ eq .Tag \"\"}` or `{{ .Env.DISABLE }}`.\r\n\r\nI'd like to make `changelog.skip` template-able in the exact same way that `release.disable` is so that I can use the same template to enable/disable them together.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nRight now my workaround is to set `release.disable` and `changelog.skip` to true in my goreleaser config. But then during CI, I modify the goreleaser config file just before the `goreleaser release` call to set `release.disable` and `changelog.skip` to false when its a tag build.\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
