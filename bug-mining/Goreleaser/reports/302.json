What happened?\n\nSo for private code, I think the best \"bet\" is to set the license to `unfree`.\r\n\r\nBut that's only what I found out after the fact — I set it to \"proprietary\" at first.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if there's a better one to use, as I only read through the [licenses.nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/lib/licenses.nix) in the nixpkgs repo.\r\n\r\nAnyway, having said all this, it would be nice if the pipeline could validate this, or maybe the config should do that? Or, add a little docs page how to distribute private code in form of documentation? Do you have any thoughts on this? I looked at the code, it seems like the license value is passed into the template that's rendered and that's it.\r\n\r\nAlso, not entirely sure if that's something that can be fixed in code. So a docs thing would work, IMHO? I can try to add something here: https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/c4dafdf55e8f1961ef20420d5d3514c6104046f9/www/docs/customization/nix.md\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nSet license to `proprietary` and watch the nur _fail_ to build:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       error: attribute 'proprietary' missing\r\n| \r\n|        at /Users/till/Documents/workspaces/reponur/pkgs/tool/default.nix:49:15:\r\n| \r\n|            48|     homepage = \"https://example.org/\";\r\n|            49|     license = lib.licenses.proprietary;\r\n|              |               ^\r\n|            50|\r\n\r\n```\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\ncurrent\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
