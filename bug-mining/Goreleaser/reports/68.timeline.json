spent all day trying to make `goreleaser` work with a floating tag.\r\n\r\nGithub doesn't make it easy to provide a short command to download a release artefact. You have to either find release number (e.g. using `jq`), or do something else. We've been using `latest_release` tag with some success in e.g. [Weave Net](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/docs/release-process.md),  however we use a fork for `github-release` there and a shell script to drive `github-release`.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to use `goreleaser` and it worked nicely for most part, however there is no option to re-create a release, and when I try to use it with a floating tag it fails while trying to re-upload artefacts. A \r\noption to re-create release on the same tag but with a new name, description and artefacts would be very nice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1687148338,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2ODcxNDgzMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/1687148338","actor":{"login":"errordeveloper","id":251467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQ2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/251467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/errordeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/errordeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fd35ed433f6e58b4988c98703f517bc810aee2fa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eksctl-io/eksctl/commits/fd35ed433f6e58b4988c98703f517bc810aee2fa","created_at":"2018-06-18T20:40:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/730060653","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/691#issuecomment-730060653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/691","id":730060653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDA2MDY1Mw==","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-19T01:19:57Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T01:19:57Z","body":"This issue has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
