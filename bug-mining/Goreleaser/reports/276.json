What happened?\n\nWhen running a snapshot build, the version passed as `{{ .Version }}` to the global hooks differs from the one specified in `snapshot.name_template`.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the snapshot pipe running after the before pipe (https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/4526c5b6813ade905f9658467c3a85aa25bdc9b9/internal/pipeline/pipeline.go#L62-L65), thus the global hooks receive the semver parsed version off the tag, yet not the modified version.\r\n\r\nOnce one builds a binary with ldflags and passes the version to a variable in the binary, the versions are different.\r\n\r\nThis can be especially hard to deal with when the before hooks generate version-specific files embedded into the binary.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nI've created a small repo for this showcase: https://github.com/ThomasK33/goreleaser-snapshot-precedence-repro\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n❯ goreleaser --version\r\n  ____       ____      _\r\n / ___| ___ |  _

[X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nI think this can be fixed by changing\r\n\r\n```go\r\n    // run global hooks before build\r\n    before.Pipe{},\r\n    // snapshot version handling\r\n    snapshot.Pipe{},\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```go\r\n    // snapshot version handling\r\n    snapshot.Pipe{},\r\n    // run global hooks before build\r\n
