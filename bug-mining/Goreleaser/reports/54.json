would be nice if you could give custom name for the generated brew tap `.rb` file.\r\n\r\nBy default `goreleaser` [uses project name](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/master/pipeline/brew/brew.go#L115) as the brew tab name.\r\nBut for example in my project [eliot](https://github.com/ernoaapa/eliot) I would like to name it as `eli`.\r\nAs an example, now user needs to `brew install ernoaapa/eliot/eliot` but I would like to use brew install `ernoaapa/eliot/eli`.\r\n\r\nI can create a PR of
