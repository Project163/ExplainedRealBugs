What happened?\r\n\r\n`nfpms.replacements` was deprecated in #3589, and the deprecation warning does indeed work properly if you use `nfpms.replacements` directly. However, the deprecation warning isn't generated if format-specific *overrides* use the replacements field.\r\n\r\nFor example, using `nfpms.overrides.rpm.replacements` doesn't seem to trigger the deprecation warning. But I assume this usage is still deprecated.\r\n\r\nOn a related topic, is there any non-deprecated way to achieve this functionality? For example, if I want to replace \"arm64\" with \"aarch64\" only on rpm and apk, but not deb, is there any way to do this in `file_name_template`? I couldn't find a template variable that reflects the format or extension for nfpm use-cases.\r\n\r\nI understand that the preferred approach now is to use `.ConventionalFileName`, and that makes sense for new projects. But for an existing project, changing to this will result in different file names than were used previously, which is non-ideal (it will break downstream users whose automation assumes the name format isn't changing)\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nThis is just a partial snippet to demonstrate the problem (no deprecation warning is generated)\r\n```\r\nnfpms:\r\n  -\r\n    overrides:\r\n      rpm:\r\n        replacements:\r\n          arm64: aarch64\r\n      apk:\r\n        replacements:\r\n          arm64: aarch64\r\n```\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n$ goreleaser --version\r\ngoreleaser version 1.15.2\r\ncommit: 90531fc87975e9b7e1dda5f7a108ae2a8064b0f2\r\nbuilt at: 2023-02-07T18:12:36Z\r\nbuilt by: goreleaser\r\ngoos: darwin\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.15.2, checksum: h1:VYCFKTzzZFnFfSqfjvOmT8ip7VcZv1Y9JV13hAuDDB8=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThank you for creating GoReleaser and nFPM, it's wonderful software!","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
