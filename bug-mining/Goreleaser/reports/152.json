What happened?\n\n`.TagSubject` and `.TagContents` in Release output are using the underlying commit subject/contents instead of the ones from the annotated tag.\r\n\r\n[Here is a test repo](https://github.com/Tuxdude/go-scratch-gh/tags) where you can see this bug in action in the release notes generated, with the release for either of tags:\r\n- [v0.3.0](https://github.com/Tuxdude/go-scratch-gh/releases/tag/v0.3.0) or\r\n- [v0.3.1-rc0](https://github.com/Tuxdude/go-scratch-gh/releases/tag/v0.3.1-rc0)\r\n\r\nBoth have annotated subject and message body, that I have also verified using git as confirmed by these commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git tag -l --format='%(contents)' v0.3.1-rc0\r\nLot of exciting features in this release.\r\n\r\n- Mix of both small and large changes in the same release.\r\n- Improves performance by 5x compared to previous release.\r\n- And more smaller changes to the codebase to improve readability.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git tag -l --format='%(contents:subject)' v0.3.1-rc0\r\nLot of exciting features in this release.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git tag -l --format='%(contents)' v0.3.0\r\nThirs release.\r\n\r\nExcited to get a third release going for this test package, getting more\r\nimpactful changes out there!\r\n\r\nThat's all folks!\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git tag -l --format='%(contents:subject)' v0.3.0\r\nThirs release.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy [`.goreleaser.yml`](https://github.com/Tuxdude/go-scratch-gh/commit/f1583aa39a7ce4fc66380f827add8d87abb9afa0#diff-7326b55c062b0f46fe9e39aace0a25f4515cf206040fb91a6fd2cae839f5e826) contains these sections to include both `.TagSubject` and `.TagContents` in the release notes header for demonstration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrelease:\r\n  header: |\r\n    ## {{ .TagSubject }}\r\n    {{ .TagContents }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I am using the `goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v2` github action in my workflow to cut releases. The [config](https://github.com/Tuxdude/go-scratch-gh/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) is available here if it makes any difference.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\n1. Create an annotated tag with both a tag subject and a message body.\r\n2. Add the following to the `goreleaser.yml`\r\n3. Invoke `goreleaser` to cut a new release.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrelease:\r\n  header: |\r\n    ## {{ .TagSubject }}\r\n    {{ .TagContents }}\r\n```\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\nv1.5.0\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
