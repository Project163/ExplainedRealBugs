Please describe.**\r\nIf I define an environment variable in the `env` section. It cannot be overridden and itself overrides an existing value.\r\nI have the following config:\r\n```yaml\r\nsnapshot:\r\n  name_template: \"{{.Tag}}-{{.Env.SNAPSHOT_NAME}}-{{.ShortCommit}}\"\r\n```\r\nIn our CI we define `SNAPSHOT_NAME=staging` or `SNAPSHOT_NAME=prerelease`.\r\nWhen working locally, a dev will have to call `SNAPSHOT_NAME=\"dev\" goreleaser build --snapshot`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like the option to define a default value for an `env` variable in the config file. Something like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndefaults:\r\n  - SNAPSHOT_NAME=\"dev\"\r\n```\r\nsuch that:\r\n- when calling `goreleaser build --snapshot`, `SNAPSHOT_NAME` resolves to `dev`\r\n- when calling `SNAPSHOT_NAME=\"custom\" goreleaser build --snapshot`, `SNAPSHOT_NAME` resolves to `custom`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI tried playing with the template and defining:\r\n```yaml\r\nname_template: \"{{.Tag}}-{{if .Env.SNAPSHOT_NAME}}{{.}}{{else}}dev{{end}}-{{.ShortCommit}}\"\r\n```\r\nBut that doesn't work since the template has the [option `missingkey=error`](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/a92774f602331c53cd6b2c3c3ec8ec9058a26a7f/internal/tmpl/tmpl.go#L161) Bash substitutions for default variables (`${SNAPSHOT_NAME:=default}`) are also ignored\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1795/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
