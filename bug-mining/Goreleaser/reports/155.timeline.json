your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, to push a release to Gitlab, one needs to setup a new API token, and configure the pipelines with it. However, there is already a job token available, via the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` env-var. It could be used to create a new release, but needs a special header to be set.\r\n\r\nRight now, goreleaser uses [`gitlab.NewClient`](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/167d95e67fe0266fd75bc5dffc949f5db550dc73/internal/client/gitlab.go#L46), which registers a [`PrivateToken`](https://github.com/xanzy/go-gitlab/blob/f8ceb0600dbec1eef4cb11d9779cc4804375dd0e/gitlab.go#L214-L222) which sets the [`PRIVATE-TOKEN`](https://github.com/xanzy/go-gitlab/blob/f8ceb0600dbec1eef4cb11d9779cc4804375dd0e/gitlab.go#L682) header value.\r\n\r\nWhat should be possible, is to call [`NewJobClient`](https://github.com/xanzy/go-gitlab/blob/f8ceb0600dbec1eef4cb11d9779cc4804375dd0e/gitlab.go#L241-L249) instead if the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` is present (or via an option I guess), which would mostly remove the need to manage an API token.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2743/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1012302322","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2738#issuecomment-1012302322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2738","id":1012302322,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBJgEXs48VoHy","user":{"login":"matteosilv","id":729629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTYyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/729629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv","html_url":"https://github.com/matteosilv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteosilv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T16:31:40Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T16:31:40Z","body":"Confirmed to work with use_package_registry=false and a [Project Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html).
