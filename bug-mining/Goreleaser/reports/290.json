What happened?\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to GoReleaser v1.22.0 this morning, our Go projects stopped building when using `--single-target`:\r\n```\r\n  ⨯ build failed after 0s                    error=build for test does not contain a main function\r\nLearn more at https://goreleaser.com/errors/no-main\r\n```\r\nNote that this is happening for projects with `main` _not_ in the root of the repository (see reproduction example).\r\n\r\nOur projects were building correctly until v1.21.2.\r\n\r\nI noticed this in the changelog for v1.22.0, maybe is related:\r\n* https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/95c990b166b047838f14a844c44aae545dadc998: fix: build --single-target (https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/pull/4370) (@caarlos0)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nConsider the following reproduction example.\r\n\r\n* `go.mod`\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule test\r\n\r\ngo 1.21.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n*

println(\"Ba dum, tss!\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout `--single-target` the build works:\r\n```\r\n$ goreleaser build --clean --snapshot\r\n  • starting build...\r\n  • loading
