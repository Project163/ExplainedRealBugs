Please describe.\r\n\r\nI tried to do a release after adding Chocolatey to the config (note: previous releases without Chocolatey worked as expected). It fails with \r\n```\r\nchocolatey requires a windows build and archive\r\n```\r\nFrom the source I can tell it is filtering for \r\nhttps://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/d2c0e4c6ad93c950c1462a653fef854c05f6e14d/internal/pipe/chocolatey/chocolatey.go#L96\r\n\r\nand from debugging I can tell the artifacts list for Windows only contains `Binary` and `UploadableBinary` types.\r\n\r\nThe `chocolatey` section in my config is adjusted from the [example](https://goreleaser.com/customization/chocolatey/?h=chocolatey) in the documentation. Unless I missed it there seems to be no notes that additional steps have to be taken to ensure we're generating `UploadableArchive` types. Therefore I expected this to work out of the box.\r\n\r\nI was initially writing this report as a bug, but while doing so I realised I have my `archives` set to `format: binary`. Again because there was no explicit warning I made the (wrong) assumption that goreleaser would take the necessary step to package my binary into whatever is needed for chocolatey.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think adding a warning/note to the mentioned page that we have to ensure that the `archives` section of the config is at least creating a `.zip` for Windows binaries would save some head scratching.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nconsidered reporting it as bug because it could be taken care of automatically, but a note in the documentation is a quick win.\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\r\n\r\n### Supporter\r\n\r\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4450/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
