I started looking into how to add this feature, I realised that goreleaser has support for the `custom_artifact_name` parameter which if `false` tells goreleaser not to append the artifact name automatically. By using this option I can actually solve the issue with a config such as:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nartifactories:\r\n  -\r\n    name: default\r\n    exts:\r\n      - deb\r\n    target: my.jfrog.io/artifactory/repo/pool/{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}.deb;deb.component=impish\r\n    custom_artifact_name: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI couldn't see this documented for Artifactory (but it is for HTTP uploads), so I added a small snippet to the docs which I think should be sufficient. See #3953 for this change.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you think there's still mileage in adding matrix parameters separately, I did get a working version which I raised as #3952
