What happened?\r\n\r\nWhen using extra files like this, with a sub-folder:\r\n```YAML\r\ndockers:\r\n  - id: test\r\n    image_templates:\r\n      - \"test\"\r\n    extra_files:\r\n      - \"files/images\"\r\n```\r\nIt will correctly read and include all files. But it will create a double folder structure. As seen from the debug info:\r\n```\r\n• copying file                  dst=dist\\goreleaserdocker2020978553\\files\\images\\ranks src=files\\images\\files\\images\\ranks\r\n```\r\nThis is due to: \r\nhttps://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/a3d3ab2058bceb4041087beab0178f1e0ea940b1/internal/gio/copy.go#L30 \r\nWhere it removes the extra subdirectory (the `src`) from the `path`. This is a wrong assumption on windows, as it uses backslashes as folder delimiters.\r\nI do not think this is a user error, as it should correctly convert between the two, and so the same config can be used on both Windows and *nix. (Locally and CI for example).\r\n \r\nRunning the above config with `files\\images` works as expected on windows. But then the issue just appears on non-Windows machines.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngoreleaser version dev\r\ngoos: windows\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.15.1, checksum: h1:GWI+6mpdyEsGU0rEtKvTA7/10L9JZhkHPh9wqXg7kSk=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis probably applies to other extra_files fields in other configuration areas. I have not checked it though. Changing the gio package to automatically convert path strings from forward to backslash on windows should fix it everywhere.\r\n\r\nOr for a more general solution sanitize all filepaths to use forward slashes, but that seems to be a bigger undertaking.","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
