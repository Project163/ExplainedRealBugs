What happened?\n\nAdding docker.extra_files in directory `dist_files/*` fails with  `invalid docker.files: can't be . or inside dist folder: dist_files`. \r\n\r\nThe problem occurs because the docker.extra_files only checks strings.HasPrefix() between `dist` folder and `files_extra` folder. \n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nCreate a config file and build a release. The build task will fail.\r\n```yaml\r\n# .goreleaser.yaml\r\n\r\ndist: ./dist\r\ndockers:     \r\n    extra_files:\r\n       - dist_files    #Fails\r\n       - dist_files/   #Fails\r\n       - ./dist_files/   #Works\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n$> goreleaser --version\r\ngoreleaser version 1.15.1\r\ncommit: 7c6bd86b286ee76cfb0a0b4ec17d18d4ee9daeec\r\nbuilt at: 2023-02-02T02:25:36Z\r\nbuilt by: goreleaser\r\ngoos: darwin\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.15.1, checksum: h1:GWI+6mpdyEsGU0rEtKvTA7/10L9JZhkHPh9wqXg7kSk=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
