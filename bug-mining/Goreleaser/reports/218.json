What happened?\r\n\r\nTrying to publish a cross-platform build that includes windows binaries to generate a Scoop manifest.\r\n\r\nIt can't find the windows builds.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nscoop requires a windows build and archive\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\n- [goreleaser config](https://github.com/DelineaXPM/dsv-cli/blob/main/.goreleaser.yaml)\r\n\r\nNote that the goos for windows is there, but it's not a single build config.\r\n\r\nIt's not finding the windows asset for the Scoop manifest.\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngoreleaser/goreleaser@v1.13.1 (stored in the aqua.yml file in the repo)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nMight be delay till first weeks in jan for response if I don't see it as I'm stepping out for holidays. Will do best to respond but bear with any delay.
