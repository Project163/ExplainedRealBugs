images:\n      - \"goreleaser/goreleaser\"\n      - \"ghcr.io/goreleaser/goreleaser\"\n    tags:\n      - \"v{{ .Version }}\"\n      - \"{{ if not .IsNightly }}latest{{ end }}\"\n      - \"{{ if .IsNightly }}nightly{{ end }}\"\n    dockerfile: Dockerfile # default\n    use: buildx # default\n    platforms:\n      - linux/amd64\n      - linux/arm64\n    labels:\n      io.artifacthub.package.readme-url: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/main/README.md\"\n      io.artifacthub.package.logo-url: \"https://goreleaser.com/static/avatar.png\"\n      io.artifacthub.package.maintainers: '[{\"name\":\"Carlos Alexandro Becker\",\"email\":\"carlos@carlosbecker.dev\"}]'\n      io.artifacthub.package.license: \"MIT\"\n      org.opencontainers.image.description: \"Release engineering, simplified\"\n      org.opencontainers.image.created: \"{{.Date}}\"\n      org.opencontainers.image.name: \"{{.ProjectName}}\"\n      org.opencontainers.image.revision: \"{{.FullCommit}}\"\n      org.opencontainers.image.version: \"{{.Version}}\"\n      org.opencontainers.image.source: \"{{.GitURL}}\"\n    build_flag_templates:\n      - \"--pull\" \n    extra_files:\n      - scripts/entrypoint.sh\n```\n\nThis would replace both `dockers` and `docker_manifests` in the current configuration.\n\nThis would mean deprecating many options in `dockers`, and the entire `docker_manifests` as well.\n\n##### Discussed in https://github.com/orgs/goreleaser/discussions/5442\n##### Another discussion in https://github.com/orgs/goreleaser/discussions/5991\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5733/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
