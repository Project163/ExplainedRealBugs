Nixpkgs already has goreleaser\r\n\r\nnixpkgs already has a setup for goreleaser, which you can run with nix using `nix shell nixpkgs#goreleaser` (modern flake-enabled CLI), or `nix-shell -p goreleaser` (older syntax, but still current).\r\n\r\nThe nix search \r\nhttps://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=22.11&show=goreleaser&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=goreleaser shows that 1.13 is the stable version.\r\n\r\nThe stable Nix configuration is at https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-22.11/pkgs/tools/misc/goreleaser/default.nix while the unstable version is bang up to date at v1.16.0 - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/tools/misc/goreleaser/default.nix\r\n\r\n# Issues with nixpkgs\r\n\r\nThe goreleaser Nix maintainers are doing a great job (thanks!) of keeping up to date, but having a central nixpkgs repo has some drawbacks in terms of getting releases merged into the central repo, and also, I often want to update just one tool (like `goreleaser`), not take in all of the downstream updates.\r\n\r\nWith nixpkgs, I'd often find myself maintaining my own version of something just to use a specific version, e.g. https://github.com/a-h/dotfiles/commit/6363839dca6a226bf3d064a4f70b355d90d7d48d or I'd have to pin a specific commit like the left hand side of this: https://github.com/a-h/dotfiles/commit/ea06709d306e80af920e02b359c5a95827d6e2f4\r\n\r\n# How flakes help and how tool makers can help\r\n\r\nSome tools are maintaining their own flake.nix files, so that you can use them as overlays. For example the xc tool maintains a flake here: https://github.com/joerdav/xc/blob/main/flake.nix\r\n\r\nIf I want to use it, I can run `nix shell github:joerdav/xc` and it will pull the latest commit of the repo, execute the build if required and I've got it.\r\n\r\nBut... I can also update my config to use @joerdav's flake as an overlay: https://github.com/a-h/dotfiles/commit/89ddf6254e911edd1030836d0d29dc534afa5e2a\r\n\r\nThe `flake.nix` takes in the stable nixos packages, but then I'm overlaying `xc` with the flake. Since @joerdav maintains the flake, I can remove my self-maintained version. Pinning is taken care of by the flake lock file, and because I can specific a specific git tag in the `github:joerdav/xc` input.\r\n\r\n```nix\r\n{\r\n  inputs = {\r\n    nixpkgs.url = \"nixpkgs/nixos-22.11\";\r\n    home-manager = {\r\n      url = \"github:nix-community/home-manager\";\r\n      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\r\n    };\r\n    xc = {\r\n      url = \"github:joerdav/xc\";\r\n      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\r\n    };\r\n    darwin = {\r\n      url = \"github:lnl7/nix-darwin\";\r\n      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\r\n    };\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  outputs = inputs@{ self, nixpkgs, darwin, home-manager, xc, ... }:\r\n    let\r\n      pkgs = import nixpkgs {\r\n        overlays = [\r\n          (self: super: {\r\n            xc = xc.packages.aarch64-darwin.xc;\r\n          })\r\n        ];\r\n      };\r\n    in rec {\r\n      homeConfigurations = {\r\n        adrian-linux = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {\r\n          system = \"x86_64-linux\";\r\n          inherit pkgs;\r\n          modules = [ ./.config/nixpkgs/home.nix ];\r\n        };\r\n      };\r\n      darwinConfigurations = {\r\n        adrian-mac = darwin.lib.darwinSystem {\r\n          system = \"aarch64-darwin\";\r\n          specialArgs = {inherit inputs;};\r\n          inherit pkgs;\r\n          modules = [ ./.config/nixpkgs/darwin-configuration.nix ];\r\n        };\r\n      };\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I wanted to use the latest `goreleaser` today, I created a flake for it at https://github.com/a-h/nix-goreleaser for personal use.\r\n\r\nIf I run `nix shell github:a-h/nix-goreleaser` I get a shell with the latest commit.\r\n\r\nIf I run `nix run github:a-h/nix-goreleaser`, it runs `goreleaser` from the latest commit of the flake.\r\n\r\nUnlike with nixpkgs, I can tag versions, so I have tagged v1.15.2 and v1.16.0. Now I can run `nix shell github:a-h/nix-goreleaser/v1.15.2` to get that version and `nix shell github:a-h/nix-goreleaser/v1.16.0` to get the other.\r\n\r\nI think this is pretty cool.\r\n\r\n# Binary distribution vs source\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion in the other issues related to nix support around wanting to ship binaries. As it happens, I didn't bother to look at the existing nixpkgs configuration and jumped straight into making my own, and gave up when the tests failed (due to goreleaser tests expecting to be in a git repo), and didn't notice that the existing nixpkgs configuration dealt with it by setting `doCheck = false;`\r\n\r\nSo... I made a hacky binary distribution version that really isn't in the spirit of nix, but got me working this morning. FWIW, the existing nixpkgs config works great, and is more appealing than binary distribution to me, but if you want to go that route, my example shows it's possible:\r\n\r\n```nix\r\n{ pkgs, stdenv, fetchurl, autoPatchelfHook }:\r\n\r\nlet\r\n  mapPlatformToName = platform:\r\n    if platform.isDarwin then \"Darwin\"\r\n    else if platform.isLinux then \"Linux\"\r\n    else platform.parsed.kernel.name;\r\n\r\n  suffixToHash = {\r\n    # Use `print-hashes.sh` to generate the list below\r\n    Linux_x86_64 = \"19n5ywhg8gdav611w0iil1drnr4l1ba7akb8andi9fk54h8r70a9\";\r\n    Linux_arm64 = \"0j28cddj5vvw6ni0hpgzazsn5qmg4pmmm23vqlrw535xvixi40jw\";\r\n    Darwin_x86_64=\"0mfsv7r2gm8zichc3rgfx45ivwfcvw6yjnl19rwmh0damir5c6yr\";\r\n    Darwin_arm64 = \"1z6na7q4ws1mxbyiimp8vagb0wvfl9pqd4pvcisz62hw7wkza2fr\";\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  mapPlatformToArchitecture = platform: {\r\n    \"x86_64\" = \"x86_64\";\r\n    \"aarch64\" = \"arm64\";\r\n  }.${platform.parsed.cpu.name} or (throw \"Unsupported CPU ${platform.parsed.cpu.name}\");\r\n\r\n  version = \"v1.16.0\";\r\n\r\n  mapPlatformToSuffix = platform: \"${mapPlatformToName platform}_${mapPlatformToArchitecture platform}\";\r\n\r\n  suffix = mapPlatformToSuffix stdenv.hostPlatform;\r\nin\r\nstdenv.mkDerivation {\r\n  pname = \"goreleaser\";\r\n  version = version;\r\n  src = fetchurl {\r\n    url = \"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/download/${version}/goreleaser_${suffix}.tar.gz\";\r\n    sha256 = suffixToHash.${suffix} or (throw \"Missing hash for suffix ${suffix}\");\r\n  };\r\n  sourceRoot = \".\"; # goreleaser doesn't have a folder in the tar.gz file.\r\n  nativeBuildInputs = if pkgs.stdenv.isLinux\r\n    then [ autoPatchelfHook ]\r\n    else [];\r\n  installPhase = ./install.sh;\r\n  system = builtins.currentSystem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# My thoughts\r\n\r\nI currently think it would be best to maintain a `flake.nix` file in the `goreleaser` project, much like the https://github.com/joerdav/xc project does. Flakes seem to be the direction of travel, and it will keep the nix ecosystem up to date immediately when a new goreleaser release hits.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1458562412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"a-h","id":1029947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjk5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1029947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h","html_url":"https://github.com/a-h","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-h/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8688581318,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBJgEXs5VueXozwAAAAIF4TrG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/8688581318","actor":{"login":"joerdav","id":19927761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI3NzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19927761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav","html_url":"https://github.com/joerdav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-07T17:31:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8688581330,"node_id":"SE_lADOBJgEXs5VueXozwAAAAIF4TrS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/8688581330","actor":{"login":"joerdav","id":19927761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI3NzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19927761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav","html_url":"https://github.com/joerdav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joerdav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-07T17:31:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1458606360","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3537#issuecomment-1458606360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3537","id":1458606360,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBJgEXs5W8JEY","user":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-07T18:04:43Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T18:04:43Z","body":"Thanks for the writeup, @a-h!\r\n\r\nI think the main advantages to being able to install binaries are being able to install closed source software, and having the build flags/etc in a single place (in our particular case, `.goreleaser.yml`).\r\n\r\nSo, that's why I initially wanted to go that way... we might make it optional to our users, though.\r\n\r\nThat being said, to make this work, goreleaser

I think that's the way.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's very easy to get into Nix, but I never tried to really sit down and learn it methodically.

I was trying to read examples, and not really understanding what the code was doing for a while.
