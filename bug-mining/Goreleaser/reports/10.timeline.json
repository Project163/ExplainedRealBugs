least two people I talked to mentioned that they wish `goreleaser` would automatically create a tag for them.\r\n\r\nI guess there are quiet a few people out there not running GoReleaser on CI.\r\nWhen running it manually, it would be definitely nice if running `goreleaser` would take a version number or something and create the tag for you.\r\nI wish we can support this use case too.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can add a command-line argument like `-tag string`.\r\nWhen you set it the specified tag will be created for you.\r\n\r\nFor the \"create a new tag\" scenario we would also not run into the problem we had with #72 \r\nbecause we don't need to switch branches since the current state is exactly what will end up in the tagged version.\r\nCreation of a new tag should be only allowed with a clean Git state though.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition these checks the [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) tool (for node.js) does could also ne useful for us:\r\n> - Ensures you are publishing from the `master` branch\r\n> - Ensures the working directory is clean and that there are no unpulled changes\r\n> - Reinstalls dependencies to ensure your project works with the latest
