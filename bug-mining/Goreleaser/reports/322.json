What happened?\r\n\r\nUsing GoReleaser with an existing published Github release make it draft and republish it.\r\nThis is painful when using goreleaser for Golang artifact management in addition to another release system like release please or semantic release cause it generates a new github event release published on the repository.\r\n\r\nI suspect this behaviour to be related to https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/ef90821ee75ef97d78a125427e6294677b4dd408#diff-5d19445232b5dbd4efabd983155c6802ae1ef1be4370176f6c30cf766d30ec22R362.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nManually create a release (a github event release published is triggered)\r\nRun goreleaser (a new github event release published is triggered)\r\n\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n1.25\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before
