See the section below for a reproduction example.\r\n\r\nThis is because GoReleaser checks for the Git state _before_ performing the clean-up, and therefore untracked files such as `dist/` mark the Git state as dirty, failing the validation.\r\n\r\nI know that this can be fixed simply by adding `dist/` (or any other configured dist directory) to `.gitignore`, but I believe that GoReleaser should not depend on ignoring files in Git and therefore I think this is a bug.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nConsider the following MRE project:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir test\r\n$ cd test\r\n$ git init\r\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/test\r\n$ go mod init test\r\n$ cat > main.go << '__EOF__'\r\npackage main\r\nimport \"fmt\"\r\nfunc main() { fmt.Println(\"Hello world!\") }\r\n__EOF__\r\n$ cat > .goreleaser.yaml << '__EOF__'\r\nversion: 2\r\nbefore:\r\n  hooks:\r\n    - go mod tidy\r\n__EOF__\r\n$ git add .\r\n$ git commit -m 'First commit'\r\n$ git tag v0.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen doing a build for the first time, it works as expected:\r\n```\r\n$ goreleaser build --clean --single-target\r\n  • loading environment variables\r\n  • getting and validating git state\r\n    • couldn't find any tags before \"v0.1.0\"\r\n    • git state                                      commit=62717029cfd2dcbff357cb8576ae5b5f883308c9 branch=master current_tag=v0.1.0 previous_tag=<unknown> dirty=false\r\n  • parsing tag\r\n  • setting defaults\r\n  • partial\r\n  • running before hooks\r\n    • running                                        hook=go mod tidy\r\n  • checking distribution directory\r\n  • setting up metadata\r\n  • writing release metadata\r\n  • loading go mod information\r\n  • build prerequisites\r\n  • building binaries\r\n    • partial build                                  match=target=linux_amd64\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/test_linux_amd64_v1/test\r\n  • writing artifacts metadata\r\n  • build succeeded after 0s\r\n  • thanks for using goreleaser!\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if you do another build immediately after, it fails because now the previously existing `dist/` directory marks the Git repository as dirty, despite asking for it be cleaned with `--clean`:\r\n```\r\n$ goreleaser build --clean --single-target\r\n  • loading environment variables\r\n  • getting and validating git state\r\n    • couldn't find any tags before \"v0.1.0\"\r\n    • git state                                      commit=62717029cfd2dcbff357cb8576ae5b5f883308c9 branch=master current_tag=v0.1.0 previous_tag=<unknown> dirty=true\r\n  ⨯ build failed after 0s                    error=git is in a dirty state\r\nPlease check in your pipeline what can be changing the following files:\r\n??
