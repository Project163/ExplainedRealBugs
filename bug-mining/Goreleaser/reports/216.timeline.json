los0 here's a test that demonstrates the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Test to show that goreleaser .tar.gz artefacts are not reproducible.\r\n# The key here is the setting of GOCACHE to a new directory. This\r\n# correctly simulates building a release binary with the same sha256sum\r\n# (assuming -trimpath etc are used) but which has different timestamps\r\n# because it was created fresh.\r\n\r\n# To test https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/pull/3618\r\n# uncomment the following line\r\n# mv .goreleaser.yaml.new .goreleaser.yaml\r\n\r\n# run1\r\nenv GOCACHE=$WORK/cache1\r\nexec goreleaser release --rm-dist --snapshot\r\nexec sha256sum dist/hello_world_Linux_arm64.tar.gz\r\ncp stdout run1\r\n\r\n# run2\r\nenv GOCACHE=$WORK/cache2\r\nexec goreleaser release --rm-dist --snapshot\r\nexec sha256sum dist/hello_world_Linux_arm64.tar.gz\r\ncp stdout run2\r\n\r\n# Ensure the sums from both runs are identical\r\ncmp run1 run2\r\n\r\n-- go.mod --\r\nmodule mod.com\r\n\r\ngo 1.18\r\n-- main.go --\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport \"fmt\"\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tfmt.Println(\"Hello, world\")\r\n}\r\n-- .goreleaser.yaml --\r\nproject_name: hello_world\r\ngomod:\r\n  proxy: true\r\nbefore:\r\n  hooks:\r\n    - go mod tidy\r\n    - go generate ./...\r\nbuilds:\r\n  - env:\r\n      - CGO_ENABLED=0\r\n    flags:\r\n      - -trimpath\r\n    ldflags:\r\n      - -s -w\r\n    goos:\r\n      - linux\r\n      - windows\r\n      - darwin\r\n\r\narchives:\r\n  - format: tar.gz\r\n    name_template: >-\r\n      {{ .ProjectName }}_\r\n      {{- title .Os }}_\r\n      {{- if eq .Arch \"amd64\" }}x86_64\r\n      {{- else if eq .Arch \"386\" }}i386\r\n      {{- else }}{{ .Arch }}{{ end }}\r\n      {{- if .Arm }}v{{ .Arm }}{{ end }}\r\n    format_overrides:\r\n    - goos: windows\r\n      format: zip\r\nchecksum:\r\n  name_template: 'checksums.txt'\r\nsnapshot:\r\n  name_template: \"{{ incpatch .Version }}-next\"\r\nchangelog:\r\n  sort: asc\r\n  filters:\r\n    exclude:\r\n      - '^docs:'\r\n      - '^test:'\r\n\r\n-- .goreleaser.yaml.new --\r\nproject_name: hello_world\r\ngomod:\r\n  proxy: true\r\nbefore:\r\n  hooks:\r\n    - go mod tidy\r\n    - go generate ./...\r\nbuilds:\r\n  - env:\r\n      - CGO_ENABLED=0\r\n    flags:\r\n      - -trimpath\r\n    ldflags:\r\n      - -s -w\r\n    goos:\r\n      - linux\r\n      - windows\r\n      - darwin\r\n\r\narchives:\r\n  - format: tar.gz\r\n    name_template: >-\r\n      {{ .ProjectName }}_\r\n      {{- title .Os }}_\r\n      {{- if eq .Arch \"amd64\" }}x86_64\r\n      {{- else if eq .Arch \"386\" }}i386\r\n      {{- else }}{{ .Arch }}{{ end }}\r\n      {{- if .Arm }}v{{ .Arm }}{{ end }}\r\n    format_overrides:\r\n    - goos: windows\r\n      format: zip\r\n    builds_info:\r\n      group: root\r\n      owner: root\r\nchecksum:\r\n  name_template: 'checksums.txt'\r\nsnapshot:\r\n  name_template: \"{{ incpatch .Version }}-next\"\r\nchangelog:\r\n  sort: asc\r\n  filters:\r\n    exclude:\r\n      - '^docs:'\r\n      - '^test:'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that with a clear `GOCACHE`, then the binaries generated by `go build` have different timestamps. They have identical `sha256sum` values, but different timestamps. Hence, the test of simply running two consecutive builds is not sufficient AFAICT. \r\n\r\nThe test above: \r\n\r\n* fails on current tip ddf7660b6d6621804c15cbbb3864a66de9f06876\r\n* fails against #3618 (381a11b15ece27b08511d50b668fdf016e4d4c01), even with the uncommenting shown in the test above\r\n* succeeds against a hack PR I put together in #3635 (c56e015c46334bf5695867f5c11f23116857cec7)\r\n\r\nPlease use from #3635 whatever you want. I'm quite happy for you to close it and submit a proper more clean fix. It was just a proof of concept.
