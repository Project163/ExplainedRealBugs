part of https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/5  I'm processing / parsing the checksum file that is generated.\r\n\r\nIt appears \" the standard\" is  HASH-TWOSPACES-FILENAME (one space as delimiter, one other space indicating something else.. it could be a '*' or '?' but no one seems to use them).\r\n\r\ngoreleaser is doing HASH-TAB-FILENAME  which sha256sum and all it variations do not like.  sha256sum -c barfs when  this is passed in.  I've tested macOS, busy box and gnu implementations.  All do not like it.\r\n\r\nI do not know anything about windows, so no idea.\r\n\r\nAny idea why tab is used?\r\n\r\nNot a huge deal as I can hack around this via regular unix CLI tools.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to fix I can submit a PR (trivial).\r\n\r\nn\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
