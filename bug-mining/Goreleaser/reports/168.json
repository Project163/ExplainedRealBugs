Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nWe'd like to be able to publish the terraform module to our GitLab terraform registry for our Go project as part of GoReleaser. This requires archiving our terraform module directory and uploading it to GitLab.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to be able to create an archive from arbitrary files within the repository, without requiring a binary to be bundled with the archive. For example:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\narchives:\r\n  -\r\n    id: terraform\r\n    name_template: \"{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_terraform\"\r\n    files:\r\n      - terraform/*\r\n\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI've considered using a custom publisher which contains a script to archive + push to the terraform registry however this would become quite cumbersome to use as it'd require copying the script across numerous repositories with the same code.\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
