these.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1045867522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Tuxdude","id":1243873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1243873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude","html_url":"https://github.com/Tuxdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Tuxdude","id":1243873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1243873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude","html_url":"https://github.com/Tuxdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tuxdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-19T06:24:31Z","updated_at":"2022-02-19T06:24:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/issues/290","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/issues/290/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/issues/290/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actions/checkout/issues/290/events","html_url":"https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/290","id":645943022,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NDU5NDMwMjI=","number":290,"title":"Preserve
