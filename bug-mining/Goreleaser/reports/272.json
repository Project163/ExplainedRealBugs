Please describe.\n\nThe Winget pipeline creates one commit per file added to the PR to the upstream microsoft/winget-pkgs repo, for example: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/112476/commits. All three commits have the same message, which makes it hard to understand exactly what each commit does.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally, goreleaser would create a single commit that contains all three files.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nAlternatively, the commit messages could be updated to be more descriptive, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNew version: twpayne.chezmoi 2.35.2: add manifest\r\nNew version: twpayne.chezmoi 2.35.2: add installer\r\nNew version: twpayne.chezmoi 2.35.2: add locale\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [X] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe code that needs changing is [here](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/2a3009757a8996cdcf2a77deb0e5fa413d1f2660/internal/pipe/winget/winget.go#L353-L357).","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
