This is how the homebrew pipeline works and should be consistent with the --skip-publish flag according to the docs (user is resposible for publishing the produced files).\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nRun `goreleaser release --skip-publish` in the goreleaser (this repo:s) top folder. A goreleaser.json is not written to the dist/ folder.\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\ngoreleaser version dev\r\nmodule version: v0.174.1, checksum: h1:els5gB5csBDQbgx0zVoIaEAKWGebc8Lu1kUH4yibMzs=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt's a simple deletion of three lines on https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/master/internal/pipe/scoop/scoop.go#L37 - I'd be happy to submit a fix if this is a valid error","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
