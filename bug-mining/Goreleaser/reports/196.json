Please describe.\n\nI use my personal access token to release code to some projects on GitLab (private) and GitHub (public). Currently, when goreleaser has access to both tokens via `~/.config/goreleaser/gitlab_token` and `~/.config/goreleaser/github_token` respectively the application fails to deploy with an error message:\r\n\r\n> multiple tokens found, but only one is allowed: GITHUB_TOKEN, GITLAB_TOKEN\r\n> \r\n> Learn more at https://goreleaser.com/errors/multiple-tokens\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nMy project's goreleaser.yml has an explicit `release` block configured. I'd like it's presence to indicate that _this scm_ should be used, and that the inferring logic be disabled.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI tried setting the env_files.gitlab_token to a custom path but that also does not work. It seems the presence of both tokens makes it impossible to opt-out of the default targets.\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
