In the src/dst semantics I think the way it is DOCUMENTED (dst = real locataion, src = link name) makes the most sense, since it corresponds to what `dpkg -c` and `ls -al` will output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nl--------- 0/0               0 2020-12-30 09:36 ./usr/bin/pcp -> /usr/bin/pcopy\r\nl--------- 0/0               0 2020-12-30 09:36 ./usr/bin/ppaste -> /usr/bin/pcopy\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- OS version: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n- GoReleaser Version 0.150.1\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
