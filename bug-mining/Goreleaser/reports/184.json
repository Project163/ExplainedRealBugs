Please describe.\r\n\r\nIsn't #1310 fairly easy now with [nfpm](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm)?\r\nTried a `deb` build with different `bindir` and could install it successfully with `dpkg --force-all` (was just complaining about achitecture not being specified as `aarch64`).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nTermux config or ability to set architecture name for deb file. Maybe not even needed and was just sth. related to installing it with `dpkg` instead of `pkg`.
