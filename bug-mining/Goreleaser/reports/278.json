status 1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I call `cyclonedx-gomod` directly from my shell it works successfully.\r\n\r\nFrom the error, I saw that `cyclonedx-gomod` calls the `go list` command itself -- that also does not give me an error when run from my shell.  But, after a lot of debugging / building minimal test cases, I was able to get this error out of it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild cache is required, but could not be located: GOCACHE is not defined and %LocalAppData% is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nGoreleaser's reduced set of environment variables when calling external commands does not pass through `LocalAppData`.   I locally added this to the list of `passthroughEnvVars` and my problem is solved.
