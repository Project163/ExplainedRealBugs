Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nThe quick start documentation [here](https://goreleaser.com/quick-start/) implies that after running `goreleaser init`, `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean` should succeed.\r\n\r\nHowever, `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean` invocation ends in an error:\r\n\r\n```error=couldn't guess project_name, please add it to your config```\r\n\r\nThis is because the default generated `.goreleaser.yaml` does not have a `project_name` name set in the yaml file. \n\nAdding the `project_name` makes the run to succeed.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThere are two options:\r\n\r\n- Add the `project_name` attribute to the generated yaml file when the `goreleaser init` is run\r\n- Add an extra step in the documentation asking the user to set the `project_name` attribute\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI added the `project_name` attribute myself and it worked, but had to dig around for what's possibly wrong since the Quick start does not mention it.\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
