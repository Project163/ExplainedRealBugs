This has worked very well for several months. On 6 February 2020 tried to release a new version, but the snap was automatically rejected by the snap store with the message:\r\n\r\n    chezmoi-completion.bash does not exist lint-snap-v2_completer (chezmoi)\r\n\r\nThe log from the release process is [here](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/runs/430851329?check_suite_focus=true).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nThe relevant lines from my `.goreleaser.yaml` file are:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsnapcrafts:\r\n- builds:\r\n  - chezmoi-cgo-snap\r\n  - chezmoi-nocgo-snap\r\n  summary: \"Manage your dotfiles across multiple machines, securely.\"\r\n  description: \"Manage your dotfiles across multiple machines, securely.\"\r\n  publish: true\r\n  grade: stable\r\n  confinement: classic\r\n  apps:\r\n    chezmoi:\r\n      completer: completions/chezmoi-completion.bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expected the snap to pass the snap linter and be accepted by the snap store.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- OS version: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS\r\n- GoReleaser Version 0.126.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI suspect (but am not sure) that the this is due to commit is a4c91105, and specifically the call to `filepath.Base` at line 245 (new version) which strips the directory from the path to the completer script. This (I think) needs to be replaced with a function that maintains the relative path to the completer script.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
