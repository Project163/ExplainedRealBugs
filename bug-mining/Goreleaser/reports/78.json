NFPM will fail complaining about the empty package name\r\n\r\n\r\nlog sample:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n   • LOADING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\r\n   • skipped                   reason=release pipe is disabled\r\n...\r\n   • LINUX PACKAGES WITH NFPM\r\n   ⨯ release failed after 6.43s error=invalid nfpm config: package name cannot be empty\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. do not set `project_name` in `.goreleaser.yml`\r\n2. add `disable: true` under `release`\r\n3. run goreleaser\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# project_name: xxx\r\nrelease:\r\n  disable: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`ProjectName` will be inferred from the git project name. You can tell that from the result packages.
