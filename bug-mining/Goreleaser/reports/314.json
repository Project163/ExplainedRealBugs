Please describe.\n\nThe checksum feature currently lumps all the checksums for a release into a single `checksums.txt` file. If we're using automation to download and verify our release binaries, some tools may not be able to parse the `checksums.txt` file correctly.\r\n\r\nFor our use-case, we're using gorelease to build and release a Vault plugin. To register the vault plugin, we need to pass the binary and sha256 has to vault: https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-catalog Because the hash is store in `checksums.txt`, rather than in an individual checksum file per file, it is a bit hard to automate.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to be able to produce checksums for each released asset individually in self-contained files.\r\nFor example, if my release has 2 artifacts, I'd like to have 2 checksums:\r\n- `my_plugin.exe`\r\n- `my_plugin.exe.sha256`\r\n- `my_plugin_linux`\r\n- `my_plugin_linux.sha256`\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nNone\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4618/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
