However, Raspbian, a derivative of Debian still used today, considers armhf to be armv6. Therefore, the Debian packages generated by GoReleaser does not work and users get \"Illegal instruction\" errors.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nWe are using this configuration file: https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/blob/master/.goreleaser.yml\r\n\r\nI am a bit lost at what exactly GoReleaser does because GoReleaser seems to get `armhf.deb` and `armel.deb`, while we get `armv6.deb` and `armv7.deb`. I don't know if there is an easy way to check the real EABI of the DEB files from GoReleaser as `file` says `ARM, EABI5 version 1` whatever it is for ARMv6 or ARMv7.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/pull/626 and https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/pull/624#issuecomment-984784505.\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n1.1.0 fails: https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/runs/4396570024?check_suite_focus=true\r\n1.0.0 fails too: https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/runs/4258994552?check_suite_focus=true\r\n0.182.0 is OK: https://github.com/nextdns/nextdns/runs/4400025574?check_suite_focus=true\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2721/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
