GOWORK=off\r\n    goos:\r\n      - linux\r\n    goarch:\r\n      - amd64\r\n      - arm\r\n      - arm64\r\n    flags:\r\n      - -mod=vendor\r\n      - -tags=\"linux\" # sqlite3 requirement https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#linux\r\n      - -v\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the step/pipe `loading go mod information`, `goreleaser build` tries to run `go list -m ` but it fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfailed to get module path: exit status 1: go: open /tmp/sdk-go/go.mod: no such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's because there are some `replace` directives in my `go.mod` file.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem outside goreleaser if we set the env variable `GOWORK=off` as in `GOWORK=off go list -m -mod=vendor`.\r\n\r\nI already include `- GOWORK=off` as part of my `env` but `internal/pipe/gomod/gomod.go` is not using to call `go list -m`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\n1. Create a project with a go module\r\n2. Use a `replace` directive in `go.mod`\r\n3. use go workspaces (`go.work`)\r\n4. Run `goreleaser build`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngoreleaser version dev\r\ngoos: linux\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.11.4, checksum: h1:bmXfkrBa6xv3WzzZM7U0QCOmpFAanIm+91tFB4DYUnI=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI can send a PR to make sure we execute the external command with `ctx.Config.Env`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
