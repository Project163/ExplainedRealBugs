Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Are you running the latest version?\r\n* [x] Did you perform a search to see if this problem was already reported?\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/download/v0.57.1/goreleaser\r\n_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz (current for `https://git.io/goreleaser | bash`) is building flat Zip archives.  This appears to be a regression, and changes depending on how I install goreleaser.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nPlease paste the output of:\r\n\r\n* go version go1.9.3 linux/amd64 (and 1.9.4 on travis-ci.org)\r\n* Linux cubi 4.14.0-3-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.14.17-1 (2018-02-14) x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n* The --debug output is very very long due to javascript dependencies, but I can attach if absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nConfig: https://github.com/jhillyerd/inbucket/blob/v1.3.0/.goreleaser.yml\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  git clone https://github.com/jhillyerd/inbucket\r\n2.  cd inbucket\r\n3.  goreleaser --snapshot\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\ninbucket_SNAPSHOT-f58e51d9218cabe7c389d98d8f0a37d57939734a_windows_amd64.zip contains top-level directories: etc, themes (and many subdirs)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nAll 600+ files are in the root of the Zip archive.\r\n\r\nWhen I install via `go get github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser`, this does not happen.  But my travis build is using the `|bash` setup.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kaihendry","id":765871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/765871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry","html_url":"https://github.com/kaihendry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaihendry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-08T08:19:17Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T08:19:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/695","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/695/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/695/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/695/events","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/695","id":330563187,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzA1NjMxODc=","number":695,"title":"Docker

the bug**\r\n\r\nI'm trying to send binaries to a local [`hoarder`](https://github.com/nanopack/hoarder) instance.\r\n\r\nWithout a `PUT_HOARDER_SECRET` environment variable `goreleaser` complains:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreason=put section 'hoarder' is not configured properly (missing PUT_HOARDER_SECRET environment variable)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nBut if I set the variable the output looks like this (`--debug` flag provided):\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n   • SIGNING ARTIFACTS\r\n      • skipped                   reason=artifact signing is disabled\r\n   • CREATING DOCKER IMAGES\r\n      • skipped

There is no request sent to the http server.

}}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why do you use \"{{ .ProjectName }}\" instead of \"{{ .Binary }}\" in the name template?**\r\nAccording to the [documentation](https://goreleaser.com/archive/):\r\n```yaml\r\n# Archive name template.\r\n# Defaults:\r\n# - if format is `tar.gz`, `tar.xz`, `gz` or `zip`:\r\n#   - `{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}{{ if .Arm }}v{{ .Arm }}{{ end }}{{ if .Mips }}_{{ .Mips }}{{ end }}`\r\n# - if format is `binary`:\r\n#   - `{{ .Binary }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}{{ if .Arm }}v{{ .Arm }}{{ end }}{{ if .Mips }}_{{ .Mips }}{{ end }}`\r\n```\r\nI also see it a little weird, but ok.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIt should build and compress the binary without trying to add any more files\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nIt fails with the following message: \r\n\r\n> ⨯ release failed after 1.61s error=failed to add README.md to the archive: gzip: failed to add README.md, only one file can be archived in gz format\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- OS version: Linux platon 5.6.7-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Apr 23 10:50:31 UTC 2020 x86_64
