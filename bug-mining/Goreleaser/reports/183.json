Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nIn Hugo, there have been situations where the build fails for some reason and I need to make some adjustments to a script or similar and then try again.\r\n\r\nWhat I do now is:\r\n\r\n* Push a release tag to GitHub.\r\n* Run Goreleaser.\r\n* If it fails and I need to change something, I delete the remote tag and try again.\r\n\r\nI know I should probably increment a version number, but that is just too much work. I don't mind doing the above, but with the new `gosumdb` validation in place and people running `go install github.com/gohugoio/hugo@v0.97.0` to install Hugo, we now end up with `checksum mismatch` errors that seem to be impossible to get out of.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/9785\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI assume that the current workflow \r\n\r\n1. does not require the remote tag to exist when building the binaries/archives\r\n2. does require the remote tag to exist when pushing the release to GitHub\r\n\r\nThe GitHub release API does allow a non-existing tag to be provided if you also provide the commit hash to be used for the tag (via `target_commitish`).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"514\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/394382/163558300-04422962-4bbf-48a7-bcb6-05afe9bf4c54.png\">\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how feasible the above would be in Goreleaser, but it would be nice to delay the creation of the release tag as long as possible.\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI have looked at the Goreleaser documentation for a way to split the release build in 2: 1) Build archives and 2) Push tag to GitHub 3) Release to Github, but that does not seem to be possible (there is a `--skip-publish` flag, but not a `--just-publish` flag).\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3044/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
