I currently have the following block in my `goreleaser.yaml` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrews:\r\n  - dependencies:\r\n      - name: xclip\r\n         os: linux\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the generated Forumla includes `depends_on \"xclip\"` instead of `depends_on \"xclip\" if OS.linux?`\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nThis can be reproduced with a config similar to the one I shared above. You can see the full config I have in [here](https://github.com/jahvon/flow/blob/main/.goreleaser.yaml#L52-L54) and the generated formula [here](https://github.com/jahvon/homebrew-flow/blob/main/Formula/flow.rb).\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\nGitVersion:    2.2.0\r\nGitCommit:     111121bbd98df17cc5d81888aa94a8d3694bc157\r\nGitTreeState:  clean\r\nBuildDate:     2024-08-15T01:56:53\r\nBuiltBy:       homebrew\r\nGoVersion:     go1.22.6\r\nCompiler:      gc\r\nModuleSum:     unknown\r\nPlatform:      darwin/arm64\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
