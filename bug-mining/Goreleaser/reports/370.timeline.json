PR adds support for generating source RPMs, fixing #3136.\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you for the excellent architecture in `goreleaser`! It was much easier to add this initial functionality than I expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not ready for merge yet, but is in reasonable shape, and ready for expert input:\r\n\r\n* [x] It generates reasonable `.src.rpm` files that seem to have the correct contents.\r\n* [x] the `.spec` file is configurable.\r\n* [x] it seems to integrate well with goreleaser's architecture.\r\n\r\nThere are a certainly missing features:\r\n\r\n* [ ] more thorough tests\r\n* [ ] documentation\r\n\r\nThere are a number of unanswered questions:\r\n\r\n* [ ] does this integrate with goreleaser correctly?\r\n* [x] right now, this PR uses `google/rpmpack` directly instead of `goreleaser/nfpm`; should it use `goreleaser/nfpm` instead?\r\n* [ ] what, exactly should the spec file template look like? I tried to follow [Fedora's guidelines on `.spec` files for Go projects](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Golang/) but still have many questions, especially as we're distributing source RPMs that build final binaries and don't want to create packages for every single dependency.\r\n\r\nAll feedback very welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses
