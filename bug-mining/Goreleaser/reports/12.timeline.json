the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen building snap packages with multiple builds, there is a bug where the application names are being overwritten.\r\n\r\nContext:

./cmd/ttn-lw-stack\r\n    binary: ttn-lw-stack\r\n  - id: cli\r\n    main: ./cmd/ttn-lw-cli\r\n    binary: ttn-lw-cli\r\nsnapcrafts:\r\n  - id: stack\r\n    builds:\r\n      - cli\r\n      - stack\r\n    apps:\r\n      ttn-lw-stack:\r\n        plugs: [ home, network, network-bind ]\r\n      ttn-lw-cli:\r\n        plugs: [ home, network, network-bind ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Make sure your config file is valid by running\r\n> `goreleaser check -f path-to-config-file`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`ttn-lw-stack` should execute the binary `ttn-lw-stack`.\r\n`ttn-lw-stack.ttn-lw-cli` should execute the binary `ttn-lw-cli`. \r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: ubuntu\r\n- OS version: Linux matrix 4.15.0-91-generic #92-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 28 11:09:48 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n- GoReleaser Version: dev (running from latest master)\r\n- GitLab version (if using a private hosted one)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack/issues/2351#issuecomment-614949533 \r\n\r\nTested with `v0.124.1` and the bug is not present, so I would assume that the bug was introduced with this
