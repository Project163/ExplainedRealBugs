Please describe.\n\nI use goreleaser to both build and release my projects (it's pretty great, btw ❤️). During development I like to keep an eye on the binary size to watch out for bloat, and I currently always add something like the following to my Makefile:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild:\r\n\tgoreleaser build --clean --snapshot --single-target\r\n\tdu -h \"${BIN_BUILD_PATH}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but has two issues:\r\n\r\n- It's not cross platform w/out cluttering the makefile w/ additional complexity.\r\n- The output isn't as pretty as goreleaser's 😞.\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to add something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  • building binaries\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/myapp_darwin_amd64/myapp size=6.5M\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/myapp_darwin_arm64/myapp size=6.5M\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven [where that line is currently written](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/9d91b5576a39cb0a4cba879f82c96e9320178143/internal/pipe/build/build.go#L214), I would need to relocate it to happen post-build. If that's not preferable, I could just add a new line post-build like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  • building binaries\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/myapp_darwin_amd64/myapp\r\n    • inspecting                                     size=6.5M\r\n    • building                                       binary=dist/myapp_darwin_arm64/myapp\r\n    • inspecting                                     size=6.5M\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little noisier, but a simpler addition. Up to you 🤷.\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe `du` line mentioned above.\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nThanks again for a wonderful project!","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
