What happened?\r\n\r\nI expected the following command to complete successfully:\r\n```\r\nbrew style fidelity/tap\r\n```\r\nHowever, it fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nOffenses:\r\n\r\n/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/fidelity/homebrew-tap/Formula/kconnect.rb:48:3: C: [Correctable] depends_on (line 48) should be put before on_macos (line 10)\r\n  depends_on \"aws-iam-authenticator\"\r\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n1 file inspected, 1 offense detected, 1 offense auto-correctable\r\n```\r\nI believe the issue is because within the `formulaTemplate` it lists the `Dependencies` after the `MacOS` and `Linux` packages:\r\nhttps://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/4c477b5cd186d11f096a23352b66045ea2bc7fd9/internal/pipe/brew/template.go#L145-L150\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nThis should be easily reproducible by having a formula template, *.rb, with the dependencies `depend_on` following the MacOS and or Linux packages, `on_macos` or `on_linux`.\r\n\r\nAn example formula can be found here: https://github.com/fidelity/homebrew-tap/blob/master/Formula/kconnect.rb\r\n\r\nError logs might be available here within the Github Action: https://github.com/fidelity/homebrew-tap/runs/7304043925?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n% goreleaser --version\r\ngoreleaser version 1.9.2\r\ncommit:

search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nOutput for `goreleaser check`:\r\n```\r\n% goreleaser check\r\n   • loading config file       file=.goreleaser.yml\r\n   • checking config: \r\n   • config is valid \r\n```\r\nI think this is an easy enough change, and I would be happy to help contribute. Please let me know if I can take on this issue, or if I am mistaken.\r\n\r\nWe can also see within the Homebrew Formula Cookbook, they appear to have the `Dependencies` defined early on in the formula:\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Formula-Cookbook.md#grab-the-url","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
