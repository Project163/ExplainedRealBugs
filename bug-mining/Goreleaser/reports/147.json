What happened?\n\nCreated a new release for Changie which writes its own release notes file and passes it to goreleaser. In the latest release I also added docker releases and the body of the release only has the docker image details and not the contents of the release notes file.\r\n\r\nI edited the release so below is what the output was versus what I expected.\r\n\r\nOutput was:\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Docker images\r\n\r\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/miniscruff/changie:v1`\r\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/miniscruff/changie:v1.1`\r\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/miniscruff/changie:v1.1.0`\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected: ( release note file should be above docker images )\r\n```\r\n## v1.1.0 - 2021-10-24\r\n### Added\r\n* [#166](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie/issues/166) Option to use environment variable for config path\r\n* [#166](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie/issues/166) Try and load .changie.yml if .changie.yaml fails\r\n\r\n## Docker images\r\n\r\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/miniscruff/changie:v1`\r\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/miniscruff/changie:v1.1`\r\n- `docker pull ghcr.io/miniscruff/changie:v1.1.0`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did have some issues with my build so this could be something I messed up on but the params seem right and I didn't get any errors.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nMy run: https://github.com/miniscruff/changie/runs/3991143359?check_suite_focus=true\r\nRepo: https://github.com/miniscruff/changie/\r\n\r\nMy guess at steps would be:\r\nUsing a config that has changelog: skip and docker images defined, pass --release-notes to goreleaser release.\r\n`/opt/hostedtoolcache/goreleaser-action/0.183.0/x64/goreleaser --rm-dist --release-notes=changes/v1.1.0.md --skip-validate`\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\nusing the latest goreleaser action ( dependabot auto updates for me )\r\nv0.183.0\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
