Please describe.\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nThanks for goreleaser !\r\n\r\nI use goreleaser in a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/blob/29a516ad51c90292280c277bc222cb0f907ed836/docker/Dockerfile#L5). I'm building both snapshot and release. I use goreleaser build instead of release to use --single-target. However, there I need to workaround the miss of `--auto-snapshot` available in release command.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to use `gorelease build --clean --single-target --auto-snapshot`.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI work around using a script:\r\n\r\n``` dockerfile\r\nRUN if git describe --tags --exact-match; then \\\r\n    goreleaser build --clean --single-target; \\\r\n    else \\\r\n    goreleaser build --clean --single-target --snapshot ; \\\r\n    fi\r\n```\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [ ] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4891/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
