allow env vars for `archive.name_template`\r\n* inject binary filename into `Dockerfile`\r\n\r\nLet me provide some background for this PR and if you agree with the approach then I'll add tests and update the documentation.\r\n\r\nI want to use goreleaser to release https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio. I have some special requirements for naming and packaging most of which were already supported by goreleaser. At this point I don't want to change the naming of the artifacts since this would break the debian/ubuntu packages that people are building and which they have automated. \r\n\r\nFor fabio I need to publish releases with the binary artifacts for multiple platforms with the following names:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfabio-VERSION-go1.x.x-GOOS_GOARCH\r\nfabio-1.5.3-go1.9.2-linux_amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also need to publish Docker containers which contain the go version in the tag since I sometimes publish the current version built with a newer go version, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfabiolb/fabio:1.5.3-go1.8.5\r\nfabiolb/fabio:1.5.3-go1.9.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n#437 added support for the env vars in the Docker tags which allows me to inject the go version into the Docker tags.\r\n\r\nThis change now adds support for env vars in the `name_template` so that I can build artifacts with the go version. \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\narchive:\r\n  name_template: '{{ .ProjectName }}-{{ .Version }}-{{ .Env.GOVERSION }}-{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}'\r\n  format: binary\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, that breaks the generation of the Docker container since the name of the binary is no longer known upfront in a static Dockerfile. `COPY fabio /` no longer works since the binary is now `fabio-1.5.3-go1.9.2-linux_amd64`. \r\n\r\nThe Dockerfile has an `ENV` directive which allows for some templating but I couldn't figure out how to overwrite the ENV variable from the command line with `docker build`. If that is possible then the change becomes much simpler and works outside of goreleaser as well and I would actually prefer that. (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#environment-replacement)\r\n\r\nThe approach in this PR is to copy the Dockerfile and expand the `${BINARY}` variable in the `Dockerfile` to the true filename of the artifact. Then you can write something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM scratch\r\nENV BINARY fabio\r\nCOPY ${BINARY} /fabio\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/fabio\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
