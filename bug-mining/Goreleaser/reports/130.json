What happened?\n\nIn goreleaser 0.170.0+, if your binary is in a subdirectory, that subdirectory is trimmed out when the binary is added to the package.\r\n\r\nhere is some debug output from a 0.169.0 release:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      • adding binary to package  arch=amd64 dst=/apps/testapp/bin/testbin package=testapp_latest.deb src=/build/dist/testbin_linux_amd64/testbin\r\n      • adding binary to package  arch=amd64 dst=/apps/testapp/bin/nesteddir/nestedbin package=testapp_latest.deb src=/build/dist/nestedbin_linux_amd64/nesteddir/nestedbin\r\n```\r\n\r\nand here is some debug output from a 0.170.0 release:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      • adding binary to package  arch=amd64 dst=/apps/testapp/bin/testbin package=testapp_latest.deb src=/build/dist/testbin_linux_amd64/testbin\r\n      • adding

commit. It seems the commit a0dd4559, which was to fix #2311, fixed the archive part of the bug, but left the nfpm part of the bug there.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nIn `builds`, specify a binary in a subdirectory (e.g. `binary: some/dir/mybinary`).\r\n\r\nThen, create a deb with `nfpms`.\r\n\r\n`some/dir` will be left out of the deb, and `mybinary` will exist directly in the `bindir` specified in `nfpms`.\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\nThe subdir is omitted in 0.170.0+. 0.169.0 works as I would expect.\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
