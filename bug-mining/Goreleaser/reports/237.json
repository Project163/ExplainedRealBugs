What happened?\n\nWhen using Gitbash on Windows within VSCode, gpg signing fails, giving the error: `gpg: no default secret key: No secret key`, despite having a valid GPG key.\r\n\r\n### Suspected Cause of the Error\r\nGoRealeaser is using the wrong installation of GPG (Gitbash GPG instead of GnuPG). Both are available via the %PATH%.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ where gpg\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\gpg.exe\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\nBefore executing GPG:\r\n1. Check `git config gpg.program`\r\n2. If string empty, break sequence and use default path.\r\n3. Use `git config gpg.program` as the gpg binary path.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git config gpg.program\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe\r\n```\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\n1. Install: VScode, Gitbash, GnuPG\r\n2. Import a key into Kleopatra.\r\n3. Set `goreleaser.yml` to appendix A\r\n4. Open a Gitbash terminal in VSCode and execute `goreleaser release`.\r\n\r\n#### Appendix A\r\n> .goreleaser.yml\r\n```bash\r\nsigns:\r\n  - artifacts: checksum\r\n    output: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\ngoreleaser version dev\r\ngoos: windows\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.14.1, checksum: h1:b+cW4BSDL5Ii32scSX8IoXrnpwHIItXgZyMskBhNK8s=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nThere is a temporary hacky fix by setting:\r\n```yaml\r\nsigns:\r\n  - artifacts: checksum\r\n    output: true\r\n    cmd: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuPG\\bin\\gpg.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is, different users and CI/CD systems have different configurations, thus different GPG paths. Thus, builds will fail depending on the build environment. Hence, the need for a more robust solution, e.g. accessing the `git config gpg.program` variable for a seamless developer experience.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"go-compile","id":97609133,"node_id":"U_kgDOBdFlrQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97609133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile","html_url":"https://github.com/go-compile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-compile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
