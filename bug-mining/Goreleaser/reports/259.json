What happened?\r\n\r\nGenerated Homebrew formulas  from valid .goreleaser.yaml files should not trigger this warning on `brew install` and `brew doctor`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Calling plist_options is deprecated! Use service.require_root instead.\r\nPlease report this issue to the bbkane/tap tap (not Homebrew/brew or Homebrew/homebrew-core), or even better, submit a PR to fix it:\r\n  /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/bbkane/homebrew-tap/Formula/grabbit.rb:49\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this in [grabbit](https://github.com/bbkane/grabbit). The generated formula is [here](https://github.com/bbkane/homebrew-tap/blob/91e00744ab969e9cee9858df94113a09f0a4eaf2/Formula/grabbit.rb).\r\n\r\nYou can see this warning from Homebrew with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install bbkane/tap/grabbit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also reproducible locally with the latest `goreleaser` with the following steps:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/bbkane/grabbit.git\r\ncd grabbit\r\ngoreleaser release --snapshot --clean\r\nbrew install --build-from-source ./dist/grabbit.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis notably fails with a bunch of other errors due to it being a snapshot build, but the first `plist_options` one is the one that shows up even from a non-snapshot build.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install --build-from-source ./dist/grabbit.rb\r\nWarning: Calling plist_options is deprecated!
