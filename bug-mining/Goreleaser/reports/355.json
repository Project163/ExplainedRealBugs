What happened?\n\nIf you have a app named `baton-1password`, goreleaser generates a class name for the homebrew Formula of `Baton1Password`, while homebrew expects a class name of `Baton1password` (lowercase p).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in this situation, homebrew will error out like this:\r\n```\r\nIn formula file: /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/conductorone/homebrew-baton/Formula/baton-1password.rb\r\nExpected to find class Baton1password, but only found: Baton1Password.\r\n```\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nhttps://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-1password/blob/main/.goreleaser.yaml#L68-L77\r\n\r\noutputs:\r\nhttps://github.com/ConductorOne/homebrew-baton/blob/main/Formula/baton-1password.rb\r\n\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\ngoreleaser/goreleaser-action@v6\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is a related issue to https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/pull/3117 and https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3116\r\n\r\nBasically the improved function doesn't match all of the behaviors of the ruby function.","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
