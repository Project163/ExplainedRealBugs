What happened?\n\nThe last version of GoReleaser (1.14.1) fails if we add an override like this in the nfpms section:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nnfpms:\r\n  - ...\r\n    overrides:\r\n      deb:\r\n        depends:\r\n          - some-package\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe message displayed looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ⨯ release failed after 0s                  error=yaml: unmarshal errors:\r\n  line 127: field depends not found in type config.NFPMOverridables\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `dependencies` instead of `depends` works as expected.\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nUse `depends` as is documented at https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/c747445d0bdf3b6d7024c8d776df7da244e8d9af/www/docs/customization/nfpm.md?plain=1#L239-L252\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\n$ goreleaser
