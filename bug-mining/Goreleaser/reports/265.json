Please describe.\n\nAt present, this is automatically set to `true` due to GitHub's [default API behavior around `make_latest`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-release), and goreleaser not [providing any value](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/c57cdab0c6f30be07979669a465a17062345c3ef/internal/client/github.go#L346-L352).\r\n\r\nThis can be problematic when you are maintaining a series of minor release ranges, as any time a release is made it is marked as \"latest\" while this may not actually be true in terms of SemVer ordering.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n```yaml\r\n# .goreleaser.yaml\r\nrelease:\r\n  # If set to false, will not mark the release as \"latest\".\r\n  # Not compatible with \"prerelease\".
