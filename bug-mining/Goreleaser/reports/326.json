Please describe.\r\n\r\nGoReleaser already supports `tar.gz` and `tar.xz` as archive formats. It would be helpful for me if GoReleaser also supported `tar.zst` (tar + [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/)). This is because Zstandard can compress and decompress faster when the compression ratio is about the same as gzip.\r\n\r\nThere is an implementation of Zstandard written in Go (<https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd>), so I think this can be implemented.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think the same solution as for `tar.gz`, `zip`, etc. is desirable.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# .goreleaser.yaml\r\narchives:\r\n  - format: tar.zst\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAfter creating tar archives, use the `zstd` command to compress them.\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\r\n\r\n### Supporter\r\n\r\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4820/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
