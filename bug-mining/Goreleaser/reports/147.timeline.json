setup a much smaller project with a more minimal setup hopefully and the issue seems to happen again. Here is that project and build https://github.com/miniscruff/gekko/runs/4994509579?check_suite_focus=true, ( it is just a dumb little echo CLI ). One more maybe hint, the release description isn't 100% empty, there is an empty line. So maybe something failed to read or write but got one line in there? Not sure.\r\n\r\nEdit: As an extra sanity check I added a `cat ${release notes path}` just to make sure the file does, in fact, exist. \r\nhttps://github.com/miniscruff/gekko/runs/4994555912?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nEdit 2: I removed the docker builds here https://github.com/miniscruff/gekko/releases/tag/v0.3.0 and the issue persists, so at least its not related to that.\r\n\r\nEdit 3: Ok I found the diff that makes it work and not work. Build 0.5.0 here https://github.com/miniscruff/gekko/runs/4994608162?check_suite_focus=true does NOT work but Build 0.4.0 here https://github.com/miniscruff/gekko/runs/4994592749?check_suite_focus=true does work. The diff in the two: https://github.com/miniscruff/gekko/commit/c4e5d799442b738d6bc8d41645f69e1b6e52a8da#diff-42e26dc67aed8aa3edb2472b4403288c1699fb6dc47419b9a475f0f224fe4689L43 \r\n```yaml\r\nchangelog:\r\n  skip: false = works, true = does not\r\n```\r\nNow reading the docs again it seems that when skip=true that means no changelog is generated whatsoever, where as at some point in the past this meant it was not auto-generated but the env var for release notes path was still used? It is not quite clear from the docs but it seems to be the case that, if you want to use a pre-made file you set changelog skip to false ( or just leave it out as I think that is the default ). But then still set your env var for release notes path which is then used? \r\n\r\nI hope this helps, and I can always doing more tests if needed.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1025054967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"miniscruff","id":8585244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODUyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8585244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff","html_url":"https://github.com/miniscruff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miniscruff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1025154376","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2601#issuecomment-1025154376","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2601","id":1025154376,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBJgEXs49Gp1I","user":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-30T14:24:49Z","updated_at":"2022-01-30T14:24:49Z","body":"pretty
