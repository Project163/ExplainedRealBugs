After taking a look at the goreleaser_Windows_x86_64.zip file for version v0.174.0, it appears that the internal directory structure has changed:\r\n\r\nPreviously, it looked like this:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── completions\r\n│   └── *\r\n│       └── completions\r\n│           ├── goreleaser.bash\r\n│           ├── goreleaser.fish\r\n│           └── goreleaser.zsh\r\n├── goreleaser.exe\r\n├── LICENSE.md\r\n│   └── LICENSE.md\r\n└── README.md\r\n    └── README.md\r\n\r\n5 directories, 6 files\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now it looks like this:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── completions\r\n│   ├── goreleaser.bash\r\n│   ├── goreleaser.fish\r\n│   └── goreleaser.zsh\r\n├── goreleaser.exe\r\n├── LICENSE.md\r\n└── README.md\r\n\r\n1 directory, 6 files\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that the \"*\" in the path is what's causing the issue, as this is an illegal character for Windows file names.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by running the `goreleaser` workflow located here:\r\nhttps://github.com/NoamDolovichWS/GoReleaserReproduce\r\n\r\nIn addition, an example run with the success/failures can be accessed
