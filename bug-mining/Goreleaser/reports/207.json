What happened?\r\n\r\nOur *Dockerfile* used this COPY command:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nCOPY refs-controller /bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut we were getting an error like this:\r\n```\r\n#6 ERROR: \"/refs-controller\" not found: not found\r\n------\r\n > [2/3] COPY refs-controller /bin/:\r\n------\r\nerror: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: \"/refs-controller\" not found: not found\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nMaybe it happens with any binary that includes a `-` in the name?\r\n\r\nWe tried this instead:\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nCOPY * /bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we got this in bin:\r\n```\r\nbin/Dockerfile\r\nbin/refs-controller\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo basically we knew that `refs-controller` was there.\r\n\r\nWe end up tricking **goreleaser** with:\r\n```\r\nCOPY *controller /bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngoreleaser version dev\r\ngoos: linux\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.12.3,
