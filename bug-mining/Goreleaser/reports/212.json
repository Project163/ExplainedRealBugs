Please describe.\r\n\r\nGoReleaser exposes various information for single artifacts via templates, as mentioned in https://goreleaser.com/customization/templates/#single-artifact-extra-fields. I have binaries generated by `xgo` that need to be placed inside an archive. Binaries compiled by `xgo` use the Go naming convention for architectures, so `amd64`, `arm64`, etc.\r\n\r\nI also instruct users to choose the correct file to download by using `uname -m`. This means I have to use replacements to make it match that convention (`x86_64`, `aarch64`, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible to use `{{.Arch}}` to select the correct binary.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI'd like there to be new template fields for non-replaced values, maybe something like `{{.OriginalArch}}`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI could remove the replacements, but this would make it a lot harder for users to download the correct file for their machine. I could also use a template string with a bunch of if statements to convert it back, but that isn't a very good solution.\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
