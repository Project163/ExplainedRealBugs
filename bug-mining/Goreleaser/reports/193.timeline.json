for the ping @dirien!\r\nHi @caarlos0, the PR is created against the `withfig/autocomplete` repo so apart from having an action running here (e.g. when you release a new version) everything would be handled by the fig team.\r\n\r\nOf course the integration can be used as you mean. Essentially we expose two main methods:\r\n- An \"high-level\" one that automatically adds the \"generate-fig-spec\" command to your cli so that when you run \"goreleaser generate-fig-spec\" it prints the completion file\r\n- A \"low-level\" that instead of doing everything mentioned above just takes as input your root command and returns a stringified spec\r\n\r\nWe can bind the second one to \"goreleaser completion fig\" in the github action use it easily.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1228922479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fedeci","id":38510000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTEwMDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38510000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci","html_url":"https://github.com/fedeci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedeci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7270240719,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBJgEXs5QLTpuzwAAAAGxVxHP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/7270240719","actor":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-26T20:31:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7270240725,"node_id":"SE_lADOBJgEXs5QLTpuzwAAAAGxVxHV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/7270240725","actor":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-26T20:31:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7270240729,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBJgEXs5QLTpuzwAAAAGxVxHZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/7270240729","actor":{"login":"dirien","id":38325136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzI1MTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38325136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien","html_url":"https://github.com/dirien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-26T20:31:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7270240732,"node_id":"SE_lADOBJgEXs5QLTpuzwAAAAGxVxHc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/7270240732","actor":{"login":"dirien","id":38325136
