What happened?\r\n\r\ngoreleaser requires both `GITLAB_TOKEN` and `CI_JOB_TOKEN` when used in a GitLab CI with docker releases as described [here](https://goreleaser.com/ci/gitlab/#releasing-archives-and-pushing-images). If the `GITLAB_TOKEN` is set to mirror `CI_JOB_TOKEN` and the `use_job_token` option is set in the `.goreleaser.yaml` it is necessary to pass both variables to the docker container.\r\n\r\nWhat I would have expected to happen is that goreleaser would use the `GITLAB_TOKEN` as if it was the `CI_JOB_TOKEN`. This is what I understood from the documentation at least.\r\n\r\nI get why the choice was made for the current method because this enables the use of goreleaser without setting any additional CI variables, however I would update the documentation or fall back on the `GITLAB_TOKEN` as the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` when the `use_job_token` option is set.\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation of the [useJobToken](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/main/internal/client/gitlab.go#L500) function I think updating the documentation would the easier route to take.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions from [the documentation](https://goreleaser.com/ci/gitlab/#releasing-archives-and-pushing-images) and [the accompanying repository](https://gitlab.com/goreleaser/example) and add releasing to the GitLab package registry. This will fail with:\r\n```bash\r\nerror=scm releases: failed to publish artifacts: GET https://localgitlabinstance/api/v4/projects/group/project/releases/v0.2: 401 {message: 401 Unauthorized}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n```\r\nGitVersion:    1.22.1\r\nGitCommit:     52d976beaea9ba8a5b0f09f90f22135b468c33c2\r\nGitTreeState:  false\r\nBuildDate:     2023-11-08T23:40:43Z\r\nBuiltBy:       goreleaser\r\nGoVersion:     go1.21.4\r\nCompiler:      gc\r\nModuleSum:     h1:7+P9DHpKPmg160mni77AC6x43tch0DKNqULIfrYRyOU=\r\nPlatform:      linux/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\r\n\r\n### Supporter\r\n\r\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
