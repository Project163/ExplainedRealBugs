The dashboard for adding permissions doesn't allow manually adding them (as far as I can see) and you need to do it through the process of adding \"Products\" to your app, which then add relevant scopes (although this is quite opaque, it doesn't say which scopes will be added for each Product).\r\n\r\nIt looks like they've made it more difficult to request scopes.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1812844802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stefanlogue","id":28792194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NzkyMTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28792194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanlogue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanlogue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10969501092,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBJgEXs52jYX-zwAAAAKN1U2k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/10969501092","actor":{"login":"gabrielcipriano","id":20933608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTMzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20933608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielcipriano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-15T16:18:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10969501106,"node_id":"SE_lADOBJgEXs52jYX-zwAAAAKN1U2y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/events/10969501106","actor":{"login":"gabrielcipriano","id":20933608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTMzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20933608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielcipriano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-15T16:18:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/comments/1816350914","html_url":"https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4421#issuecomment-1816350914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/4421","id":1816350914,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBJgEXs5sQ1DC","user":{"login":"gabrielcipriano","id":20933608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTMzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20933608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielcipriano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielcipriano/repos","events_url":"https://api.g

They deprecated `/v2/me` in favor of `v2/userinfo`, so new applications will not have old permissions such as `r_liteprofile`.\r\n\r\n`v2/userinfo` needs the new permission `profile`\r\n\r\nI will
