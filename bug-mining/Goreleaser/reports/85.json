It will then carry on with the rest of the pipeline happily.\r\n\r\nHope to provoke that there isn't really a very intimate build support needed for Rust, or for that matter any language -- just the ability to provide a shell script, and to copy artifacts in a predictable manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/962/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
