Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Are you running the latest version?  HEAD\r\n* [x] Did you perform a search to see if this problem was already reported?\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how to specify no additional files to be included in the archive.  Bug? Doc Bug?  Feature?\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n$go version\r\ngo version go1.10 darwin/amd64\r\n\r\n$ uname -a\r\nDarwin nickg-macbook 17.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.4.0: Sun Dec 17 09:19:54 PST 2017; root:xnu-4570.41.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\ni wanted \"classic goreleaser\" behavior where the tar.gz contained just the binary.  Currently, it tries to add license, readme and changelog info.\r\n\r\nIn the `archive` stanza, in the `files` section, I tried\r\n\r\n* empty.  That just used the default behavior, and not no additional files -- expected no additional files, but I get it... sorta a yaml limitation\r\n* \"none\"  (an non-existent file) That broke the build saying it couldn't find the file - definitely not expected, but I guess I get it\r\n* \"none*\"  -- that worked.   Weird.\r\n\r\n```\r\narchive:\r\n  name_template: \"{{ .Binary }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}\"\r\n  replacements:\r\n    amd64: 64bit\r\n    386: 32bit\r\n    darwin: mac\r\n  files:\r\n    - none*\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can screw around in \r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/client9/misspell.git\r\ncd misspell\r\n./scripts/goreleaser-dryrun.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be just a documentation bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/602/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
