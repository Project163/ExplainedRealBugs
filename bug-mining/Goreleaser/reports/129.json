What happened?\r\n\r\nI want to install goreleaser by go install and I did running `go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest` as from document, but it is interrupted and return info:\r\n```\r\ngo/pkg/mod/github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@v0.177.0/internal/pipe/reddit/reddit.go:11:2: reading github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit/go.mod at revision v2.0.1: unknown revision v2.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems [vartanbeno/go-reddit](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit/) revoked v2.0.1 from [tags](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit/tags)\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\n`go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest`\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nIt's not installed yet.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nEDIT: For people who have the same problem recently, since goreleaser fixed but hasn't release the new tag yet, the go install command will still download 0.177.0 and we need a workaround, using the command below instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOPROXY=goproxy.io go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nor install the latest fixed commit of goreleaser:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@077d3491477182af5086aa8e9bf733d5c71da5c8\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
