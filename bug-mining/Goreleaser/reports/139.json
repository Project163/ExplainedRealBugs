What happened?\r\n\r\nAdding `skip_push: true` to docker steps causes the subsequent manifest step to fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   • docker images\r\n      • building docker image

quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v1.1.1-devel: exit status 1: no such manifest: quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v1.1.1-devel-amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\nThis is the config we have currently for publishing multi-arch images:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndockers:\r\n  - image_templates:\r\n      - &amd_image \"quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v{{ .Version }}-amd64\"\r\n    dockerfile: &dockerfile \"Dockerfile.release\"\r\n    skip_push: true\r\n    goos: \"linux\"\r\n    goarch: \"amd64\"\r\n    use: \"buildx\"\r\n    build_flag_templates:\r\n      - \"--platform=linux/amd64\"\r\n  - image_templates:\r\n      - &arm_image \"quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v{{ .Version }}-arm64\"\r\n    dockerfile: *dockerfile\r\n    skip_push: true\r\n    goos: \"linux\"\r\n    goarch: \"arm64\"\r\n    use: \"buildx\"\r\n    build_flag_templates:\r\n      - \"--platform=linux/arm64\"\r\ndocker_manifests:\r\n  - name_template: \"quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v{{ .Version }}\"\r\n    image_templates:\r\n      - *amd_image\r\n      - *arm_image\r\n  - name_template: \"quay.io/authzed/spicedb:latest\"\r\n    image_templates:\r\n      - *amd_image\r\n      - *arm_image\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works well, but it publishes three tagged images (for example):\r\n\r\n- `quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v1.1.1-amd64`\r\n- `quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v1.1.1-arm64`\r\n- `quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v1.1.1`\r\n\r\nThis technically doesn't cause any problems, but it would be much nicer to only push the final multiarch image (`quay.io/authzed/spicedb:v1.1.1`). OCI image clients will either pick the right arch automatically or provide options for a user to pick the underlying image, so the extra tags are unneeded. Adding `skip_push: true` causes the error above.\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngoreleaser version 0.183.0\r\ncommit: be6199f08167cc85b0b16cefc02d8106237853b1\r\nbuilt by: homebrew\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2606/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
