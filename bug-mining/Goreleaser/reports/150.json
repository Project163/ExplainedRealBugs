The default for Debian packages is to be installed in /usr/bin instead. I though of making a PR for that but not really sure how it affects APK and RPM packages. Maybe change just for DEB?\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nRun lintian on a package done with latest nfpm. You will get something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% lintian cleancontacts_0.3.0_linux_amd64.deb \r\nE: cleancontacts: dir-in-usr-local usr/local/bin/\r\nE: cleancontacts: file-in-usr-local usr/local/bin/cleancontacts\r\nW: cleancontacts: file-in-unusual-dir usr/local/bin/cleancontacts\r\n```\n\n### nfpm version\n\n```bash\n2.13.0\n```\n\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2909/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
