What happened?\r\n\r\nIn VS Code using the Red Hat YAML Extension, .goreleaser.yml fails to provide any intellisense due to the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ref '/$defs/FileInfo' in 'https://goreleaser.com/static/schema.json' can not be resolved. YAML(768)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this is an issue with the schema provided by Goreleaser itself and not with the YAML extension, since I also noticed that this ref was missing.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce this?\r\n\r\n1. Download The Red Hat YAML Extension in VSCode\r\n1. Create or open a project in VSCode\r\n1. Create a .goreleaser.yml file in the project root\r\n1. Notice the error and lack of auto complete and validation in the editor for that file\r\n\r\n### goreleaser version\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngoreleaser version 1.10.2\r\ncommit: de3f381f55c88014b0d0eba91b28923eb1a992ac\r\nbuilt at: 2022-07-08T01:15:51Z\r\nbuilt by: goreleaser\r\ngoos: linux\r\ngoarch: amd64\r\nmodule version: v1.10.2, checksum: h1:MxgA0hDbDbTLep0u3pnu7Uh1Q1p0q60mpb88eApZbgw=\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### GoReleaser Check\r\n\r\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\r\n\r\n### Search\r\n\r\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3238/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
