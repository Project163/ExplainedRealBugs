What happened?\n\nI went to publish a new version (v0.5.0) of [`osv-detector`](https://github.com/G-Rath/osv-detector) and it failed right at the end when trying to push the release to github:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   ⨯ release failed after 170.51s error=scm releases: failed to publish artifacts: PATCH https://api.github.com/repos/G-Rath/osv-detector/releases/0: 404 Not Found []\r\nError: The process '/opt/hostedtoolcache/goreleaser-action/1.9.0/x64/goreleaser' failed with exit code 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried restarting the build, and with a new tag (v0.5.1) just in case it was being thrown off by the release & tag previously being drafted and then deleted (which I _think_ I did for v0.5.0, but can't remember so I tried a new tag just incase).\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/G-Rath/osv-detector/runs/6513401634?check_suite_focus=true\r\n* https://github.com/G-Rath/osv-detector/runs/6513046522?check_suite_focus=true\r\n* https://github.com/G-Rath/osv-detector/runs/6513271249?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nI've not changed anything in my GitHub profile or repository - the only difference I knew of between these runs and the last release (which was a month ago) was that that run was using v1.8.3, and these runs were using v1.9.0.\r\n\r\nSo I pinned `goreleaser` to v1.8.3 (https://github.com/G-Rath/osv-detector/pull/97) and that was successful: https://github.com/G-Rath/osv-detector/runs/6513592978?check_suite_focus=true\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nI don't know for sure - hopefully it will be enough to use my actions workflow:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  goreleaser:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\r\n      - run: git fetch --prune --unshallow\r\n      - uses: actions/setup-go@v3\r\n        with:\r\n          go-version: ${{ env.GO_VERSION }}\r\n\r\n      - uses: actions/cache@v3\r\n        with:\r\n          path: |\r\n            ~/.cache/go-build\r\n            ~/go/pkg/mod\r\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}\r\n          restore-keys: |\r\n            ${{ runner.os }}-go-\r\n      - name: Run GoReleaser\r\n        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v2\r\n        with:\r\n          version: 1.9.0\r\n          args: release --rm-dist\r\n        env:\r\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\r\n```\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\nv1.9.0\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\nLooking over the changelogs, the main change that jumped out at me was that `go-github` was updated from v43 to v44.","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
