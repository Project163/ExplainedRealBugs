Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAs a new team member I joined my colleague on a Go project where we use `goreleaser`. Looking at the docs at goreleaser.com I am unable to understand in detail what this tool does and how to configure it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI am mainly missing two things from the docs:\r\n\r\n1) something like a CONCEPT page where the workflow / idea / concept of goreleaser is described. First we fire before-hooks, then we build, then we package and sign ...\r\n2) Explain the configuration file. Even with an existing config file I feel unable to modify things because I have no way to lookup what is supported and what each value expects.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n* Reading the code - if this is expected to use goreleaser please do it as part of your guides/docs\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/1315/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
