What I mean is this fails to pull `amd64` when running on `arm64` and fails to pull `arm64v8` when running on `amd64`. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this isn't directly related to a goreleaser change because it fails on commits that previously passed. Everything else in the test environment seems consistent as far as I can tell too.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- FAIL: TestRunPipe (30.74s)\r\n    docker_test.go:961: starting registries\r\n    --- FAIL: TestRunPipe/multiarch_with_previous_existing_manifest_on_docker (9.68s)\r\n        docker_test.go:1055:\r\n            \tError Trace:\t/src/internal/pipe/docker/docker_test.go:47\r\n            \t            \t\t\t\t/src/internal/pipe/docker/docker_test.go:1055\r\n            \tError:      \tReceived unexpected error:\r\n            \t            \tdocker build failed: seems like you tried to copy a file that is not available in the build context.\r\n            \t            \t\r\n            \t            \tHere's more information about the build context:\r\n            \t            \t\r\n            \t            \tdir: \"/tmp/goreleaserdocker545505619\"\r\n            \t            \tfiles in that dir:\r\n            \t            \t Dockerfile\r\n            \t            \t anotherbin\r\n            \t            \t mybin\r\n            \t            \t mybin_amd64.apk\r\n            \t            \t subbin\r\n            \t            \t\r\n            \t            \tPrevious error:\r\n            \t            \tfailed to build localhost:5050/goreleaser/test_multiarch:2test-amd64: exit status 1: #0 building with \"default\" instance using docker driver\r\n            \t            \t\r\n            \t            \t#1 [internal] load .dockerignore\r\n            \t            \t#1 transferring context: 2B done\r\n            \t            \t#1 DONE 0.0s\r\n            \t            \t\r\n            \t            \t#2 [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile\r\n            \t            \t#2 transferring dockerfile: 88B done\r\n            \t            \t#2 DONE 0.0s\r\n            \t            \t\r\n            \t            \t#3 [internal] load metadata for docker.io/amd64/alpine:latest\r\n            \t            \t#3 ERROR: no match for platform in manifest sha256:b53b9310c8cfdecd161bbe589b167fd4338d342c6d4ecad0fd1f5d32b390b99f: not found\r\n            \t            \t------\r\n            \t            \t > [internal] load metadata for docker.io/amd64/alpine:latest:\r\n            \t            \t------\r\n            \t            \tDockerfile:2\r\n            \t            \t--------------------\r\n            \t            \t   1 |     ARG ARCH\r\n            \t            \t   2 | >>> FROM docker.io/${ARCH}/alpine\r\n            \t            \t   3 |     ADD mybin /\r\n            \t            \t   4 |\r\n            \t            \t--------------------\r\n            \t            \tERROR: failed to solve: docker.io/amd64/alpine: no match for platform in manifest sha256:b53b9310c8cfdecd161bbe589b167fd4338d342c6d4ecad0fd1f5d32b390b99f: not found\r\n            \t            \t\r\n            \t            \tLearn more at https://goreleaser.com/errors/docker-build\r\n            \tTest:       \tTestRunPipe/multiarch_with_previous_existing_manifest_on_docker\r\nFAIL\r\n```\n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nTest output in CI\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\nmain\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this\n\n### Supporter\n\n- [ ] I am a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/caarlos0/) or a [Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) customer\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/5269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
