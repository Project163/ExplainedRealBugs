fundamentally changes the way checksums work.\r\n\r\nHistorically, we would checksum everything when the pipe ran.\r\nLater on, we added the ability to refresh the checksum at any given time, which worked fine for cases in which a file could be modified after it was first checksummed.\r\n\r\nIn #4618, @F21 requested an interesting (and IMHO valid) new feature: one checksum file per artifact, instead of a single `checksums.txt`.\r\n\r\nThat feature was simply not possible to implement with the old implementation of checksums.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR does a couple of things:\r\n\r\n- [ ] removes `artifacts.Checksum`\r\n- [ ] removes the artifacts refresh feature\r\n- [x] adds an `artifacts.Checksummer` interface\r\n- [x] adds an `artifacts.ChecksummingArtifacts`, with a new `List` method that will in fact eval the checksums every time it's called \r\n- [x] `pipe/checksum.Run` now sets the checksummer impl into `ctx.Artifacts`\r\n- [x] update docs\r\n- [x] adds more tests \r\n- [ ] updates usage of `artifacts.Checksum`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure yet if this is the best approach, but after some tries with different ideas, this is def the best one I got so far.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear any feedback you might have 🙏\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncloses
