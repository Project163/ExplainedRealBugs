Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Are you running the latest version?\r\n* [x] Did you perform a search to see if this problem was already reported?\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/download/v0.57.1/goreleaser\r\n_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz (current for `https://git.io/goreleaser | bash`) is building flat Zip archives.  This appears to be a regression, and changes depending on how I install goreleaser.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nPlease paste the output of:\r\n\r\n* go version go1.9.3 linux/amd64 (and 1.9.4 on travis-ci.org)\r\n* Linux cubi 4.14.0-3-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.14.17-1 (2018-02-14) x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n* The --debug output is very very long due to javascript dependencies, but I can attach if absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nConfig: https://github.com/jhillyerd/inbucket/blob/v1.3.0/.goreleaser.yml\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  git clone https://github.com/jhillyerd/inbucket\r\n2.  cd inbucket\r\n3.  goreleaser --snapshot\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\ninbucket_SNAPSHOT-f58e51d9218cabe7c389d98d8f0a37d57939734a_windows_amd64.zip contains top-level directories: etc, themes (and many subdirs)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nAll 600+ files are in the root of the Zip archive.\r\n\r\nWhen I install via `go get github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser`, this does not happen.  But my travis build is using the `|bash` setup.","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
