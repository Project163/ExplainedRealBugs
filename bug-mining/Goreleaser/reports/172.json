Please describe.\n\nIn conversations with @caarlos0, we have talked about experimenting with CUE as a source of truth for GoReleaser configuration. Indeed in the context of https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/discussions/3114, we are specifically looking at solving this in CUE initially, to explore the design space.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it's not possible to tell GoReleaser where to find its configuration: it appears to be hard-coded to look for `.goreleaser.yml`. \r\n\r\nWith CUE as the source of truth, however, this means exporting from CUE to Yaml to a file on disk, a file which only needs to exist temporarily (and is otherwise redundant).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA top-level flag (like `-h`, or `--debug`), say `--config-file` (please 🚲-shed a better name!), that allows us to configure where GoReleaser reads its config from. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// read GoReleaser config from /tmp/blah\r\ngoreleaser --config-file /tmp/blah --snapshot --rm-dist\r\n\r\n// read GoReleaser config from stdin\r\ngoreleaser --config-file - --snapshot --rm-dist\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would then allow us to avoid writing to a `.goreleaser.yml` file (which theoretically has race-conditions associated with it, as well as tidy-up problems) by piping the Yaml configuration directly to `stdin`. \r\n\r\n(We plan to write a `cue cmd` tooling layer task that wraps the call to GoReleaser so we can easily set `stdin`).\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe status quo: writing a temporary `.goreleaser.yml` file to disk, and then handling errors around tidy up.\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/3125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
