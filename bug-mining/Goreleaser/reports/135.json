What happened?\n\nI use twitter announce (which works fine), but it posted the incorrect URL. \n\n### How can we reproduce this?\n\nThis is most likely not a bug in Goreleaser and probably not released to Twitter announce, but to the value of `.GitURL`.\r\n\r\nWhen importing a new repsitory on Github, it suggest to add a remote like: \r\n\r\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/speedata/ets.git\r\n\r\n(notice the `.git` suffix)\r\n\r\nNow I set up Twitter announce with the following setting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nannounce:\r\n  twitter:\r\n    # Whether its enabled or not.\r\n    # Defaults to false.\r\n    enabled: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nand on `goreleaser release --rm-dist` it publishes a twitter message with an incorrect link. I don't have it anymore but I strongly believe it was `https://github.com/speedata/ets.git/releases/tag/v0.0.2`, including the `.git` suffix. This link gives a 404.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is possible to strip the `.git` suffix from the `.GitURL` or to override this in the yaml file? The `github_urls:` are documented to be for Github enterprise only, so I didn't try them.\r\n\r\nSorry that I have deleted the link too quickly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### goreleaser version\n\n```bash\ngoreleaser --version\r\ngoreleaser version 0.183.0\r\ncommit: be6199f08167cc85b0b16cefc02d8106237853b1\r\nbuilt by: homebrew\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com\n```\n\n\n### GoReleaser Check\n\n- [X] goreleaser check shows no errors\n\n### Search\n\n- [X] I did search for other open and closed issues before opening this.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"caarlos0","id":245435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0","html_url":"https://github.com/caarlos0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caarlos0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/2622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
