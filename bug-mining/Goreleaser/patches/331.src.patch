+### The Docker build context
+
+Note that we are not building any go files in the Docker build phase, we are
+merely copying the binary to a `scratch` image and setting up the `entrypoint`.
+
+The idea is that you reuse the previously built binaries instead of building
+them again when creating the Docker image.
+
+The build context itself is a temporary directory which contains the binaries
+and packages for the current platform, which you can `COPY` into your image.
+
+A corollary of that is that **the context does not contain the source files**.
+If you need to add some other file that is in your source directory, you'll need
+to add it to the `extra_files` property, so it'll get copied into the context.
+
+All that being said, your Docker build context will usually look like this:
+
+```sh
+temp-context-dir
+├── Dockerfile
+├── myprogram     # the binary
+├── myprogram.rpm # linux package
+├── myprogram.apk # linux package
+└── myprogram.deb # linux package
+```
 
-    Note that we are not building any go files in the Docker
-    build phase, we are merely copying the binary to a `scratch` image and
-    setting up the `entrypoint`.
+`myprogram` would actually be your binary name, and the Linux package names
+would follow their respective configuration's `name_templates`.
