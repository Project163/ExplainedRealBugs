 GoReleaser is a release automation tool for Golang projects, the goal is to simplify the build, release and publish steps while providing variant customization options for all steps.
 
-GoReleaser is built for CI tools; you only need a [single command line](#integration-with-ci) in your build script. Therefore, no package is required.
-You can define your [customization](#release-customization) in a `goreleaser.yml` file.
-We are also working on integrating package managers, we currently support Homebrew.
