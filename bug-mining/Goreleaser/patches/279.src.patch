+# Announcing GoReleaser v1 — the first v1 release
+
+Hello everyone!
+
+I've been holding on the "v1" release for, _checks notes_, years now. That's
+because I wanted v1 to have a "stable enough API", i.e. something unlikely to
+change.
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+A couple of months ago I realized that we'll probably never reach that, as
+things keep changing: we add more features, change old ones (sometimes on our
+own, sometimes due to changes on other tools), and so on. That way, v1 would
+never happen.
+
+Therefore, after **467 releases**, **3299 commits**, and almost **5 years** of
+hard work, I'm glad to announce that **v1.0.0 is finally here**!
+
+![It's happening!](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1/51e877d4-5114-45e7-8cda-4aa9189701bd.gif)
+
+This is a special release, as it marks GoReleaser departing from the school of
+[ZeroVer](https://0ver.org), so I decided to write this quick bit compiling the
+most notable changes and some special thanks.
+
+## Most notable changes
+
+- New `ReleaseURL` template variable, which points to the current tag release
+  page on GitHub/Gitlab/Gitea
+- Release [Krew Plugin Manifests](https://goreleaser.com/customization/krew/)
+- [Announce releases to
+  LinkedIn](https://goreleaser.com/customization/announce/linkedin/)
+- Support [GitHub-generated release
+  notes](https://goreleaser.com/customization/changelog/)
+- Better support for [keyless
+  signing](https://goreleaser.com/customization/sign/) (with `cosign` for
+  example)
+- Several [nFPM-related
+  improvements](https://goreleaser.com/customization/nfpm/): "conventional file
+  naming" per target, better arch handling, `dir` content type and others
+- [Renamed master to
+  main](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/inclusive-language-in-tech-82b19b34b7cf)
+  on both GoReleaser and nFPM
+- Some bug fixing (as always)
+
+If it feel like a regular GoReleaser v0.x release, it's because it is. The
+biggest change here is that we're leaving v0! 😅
+
+## Thanks
+
+And a big **thank you** to everyone that helps with code, issues, money, support
+and whatnot.
+
+I really appreciate it! You all make OpenSource and Indie development a bit
+easier! 💙
+
+## Get it!
+
+Without further ado, you can get it here:
+
+- [GoReleaser v1.0.0](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
+- [GoReleaser Pro v1.0.0](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser-pro/releases/tag/v1.0.0-pro)

+# Announcing GoReleaser v1.2 — Santa/5 year anniversary edition
+
+GoReleaser v1.2 is out — likely be the last feature release of 2021. 
+It also marks the first 5 years since its [first commit](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/8b63e6555be45234c4c2a69576ca2ddab705302c).
+It comes packed with some great features and fixes by several people!
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+![Christmas GoReleaser gopher!](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.2/a49c5832-6576-42ce-989f-f717cd8096f1.png)
+
+Here are some highlights:
+
+1. GoReleaser now generates a `dist/artifacts.json` file — this might help integrating with other tools (e.g. you can `jq` it to find stuff). [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/ecb800aef7723d58f4521d4cb457a972b019ba92).
+2. We now have a ["Common Errors"](https://goreleaser.com/errors/dirty/) section in our docs. This should help troubleshooting common issues and provide more context to why some errors happen. More errors should be added as we evolve. Links: [1](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/62da2dbe1396aa1e423ac41feeb12f74dbe8ac29), [2](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/73867736a5ddeb23ac4767cc541395e7d61d32bd), [3](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/8c06005bc66ff3435bd9bee32a36ebabf685cd41).
+3. Docker images are no longer listed in the changelog. It was mostly noise, making its way between the changelog and the footer, which in turn makes having custom release notes a bit harder. Users can still add them using the `footer` option. [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/30ff48a5a69f2441c7f4d12264c3c813e77d3467).
+4. Auto-refresh checksums — now if you sign your binaries with something that actually changes the file, checksums will be regenerated and thus correct. [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/cbcdd41f975b29bea58b8125fee852105ff7fe88).
+5. Improved universal binaries usage on Homebrew taps, Gofish rigs and Krew manifests. [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/e8c8a2832f42569071ff2a2d2970c1ffc7c71c96).
+6. SBOM generation — using [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) by default. GoReleaser v1.2 itself is now publishing its own sBOMs! [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/bfdec808aba208cfdedeb3bef0a16255bf1d87b3).
+7. Better support for [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)'s keyless signing. Links: [1](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/7c2a93cfaa9fb5e6b0d8c1bf01a97cb5903ea7b8), [2](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/994cbb47c3c6d38af15c88c712bd486a126ec4cd), [3](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/505888f41be5308eb7d5c6fb25df82a1bda4cc1a).
+8. Git tag annotations are now available as template variables. Links: [1](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/9b9eef04a2d1e5974d6d3e2c21048b3b2c7f37f8), [2](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/6ea7fb792a09525eab6089841a9fcd03e5991e35), [3](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/f01c60026ce6320447736a9e562af85bbf649562).
+9. Improved debug log output. [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/commit/a965789203f1d64de6856a1d5b4169d32f0b06df).
+
+You can also see the full changelog **[here](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/tag/v1.2.0)**.
+
+## **Other news**
+
+### **Supply Chain**
+
+A common subject in the recent releases has been supply chain security.
+You can notice that by the recent improvements and collaboration with [Sigstore's Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign), and the SBOM generation feature with [Anchore's Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft).
+
+We intend to keep improving in this area in order to make it easier for everyone to sign their work and publish SBOMs.
+Here's to safer internet in the future!
+
+{{< img caption="Here's to safer internet in the future!" src="c3595591-87bf-4e52-baba-a6bd8089a279.png" >}}
+
+### **Houston, we have a blog!**
+
+We now have an official [blog](https://blog.goreleaser.com)!
+
+Before I was [posting everything here in my personal blog](https://carlosbecker.com/tags/goreleaser/), and will likely still post some things here, but here the idea is to collaborate with all GoReleaser contributors to post news in the _official blog_.
+
+### **Community calls and YouTube channel**
+
+We have also scheduled our first community call! Feel free to join and suggest topics. [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/community/pull/2).
+
+The call should be streamed in our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxg5N16FKrTa4Cees434pbw). Feel free to subscribe! 😀
+
+## **Next steps**
+
+We'll continue to evolve GoReleaser to make it even better and easier to do the best thing possible.
+
+If you'd like to participate, stay tuned for our first community call in January!
+
+See y'all next year!

+# Announcing GoReleaser v1.4 — the AUR release
+
+GoReleaser can now create and publish Arch Linux `PKGBUILD` files to Arch User
+Repositories!
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+![neofetch in an arch linux container](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.4/0fab21e9-bab6-4ba6-bd6a-c99b63c868a8.png)
+
+This amazing new feature was sponsored by [Charm](https://charm.sh/).
+
+## **How does it work?**
+
+The AUR is basically a group of Git repositories that, if you push the right set
+of files, are installable on an Arch Linux box using a tool
+like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay).
+
+To push there, you'll need to create an account on 
+[the AUR website](https://aur.archlinux.org/) and inform them of the public key
+you'll be using to push.
+
+Then you just need to 
+[add some configuration to your goreleaser.yaml](https://goreleaser.com/customization/aur) 
+file and...you're done! GoReleaser will build everything for you, clone the
+repository, update the files, commit everything, and push it back.
+
+**And that's it!** You can now instruct your users to install your package with
+a command like `yay -S goreleaser-bin` or `yay -S goreleaser-pro-bin`. How
+awesome is that!?
+
+## **Other notable features**
+
+- [GoReleaser Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro) now allows you to
+  use `-snapshot` without a `-key`. This should help users without a license key
+  test things locally, or on a CI job with fewer privileges (e.g. GitHub Actions
+  on a pull request).
+- And finally, both the OSS and Pro distributions now have man pages: run `man
+goreleaser` or `man goreleaser-pro` to check them out.
+- On [GoReleaser Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro), custom variables should now
+  be  [prefixed with `.Var`](https://goreleaser.com/deprecations/#variables).
+
+## **Other news**
+
+- We still don't have a new date for our first community call. Personal life a
+  little too busy lately, will try my best to schedule it
+  ASAP. [Link](https://github.com/goreleaser/community/pull/2).
+- GoReleaser now has ~9.5k stars and 262 contributors! Thanks, everyone!
+- Our Discord server is getting new members almost daily. 
+  [Join and chat with us](https://discord.gg/RGEBtg8vQ6)!
+

+
+Full disclosure: [Charm](https://charm.sh/) is my current employer.
+
+Shameless plug: Definitely [check us out](https://charm.sh/), we are 
+[building a bunch of cool OSS stuff](https://github.com/charmbracelet)!

+# Announcing GoReleaser v1.5 — the misc improvements release
+
+GoReleaser 1.5 is out, with a handful of miscellaneous improvements.
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+## **Highlights**
+
+- Better manpages using [mango](https://github.com/muesli/mango);
+- Migrated from [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to [coral](https://github.com/muesli/coral) — which will eventually lead to faster `go install`;
+- Improved nFPM to make it easier for GoReleaser's debs and GoReleaser-generated debs that pass [lintian](https://lintian.debian.org/) checks;
+- Several improvements on GoReleaser output logs;
+- More fields are now templateable, namely on nFPMs and Universal Binaries configs;
+- Hooks now have an option to always print their outputs;
+- `goreleaser build --single-target` now copies the binary to `CWD`, also accepts a `-output` flag telling to copy the binary elsewhere;
+- Changelog passing through `goreleaser release --release-notes` now warns if the file is empty or whitespace-only, allowing to more easily debug releases;
+- You can now override build `tags`, `ldflags`, `gcflags` and `asmflags` per target platform;
+- On a similar note, you can get the runtime `GOOS` and `GOARCH` on template variables using `{{ .Runtime.Goos }}` and `{{ .Runtime.Goarch }}`.
+
+You can see the full changelog [here](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/tag/v1.5.0).

+# Announcing GoReleaser v1.13 — the November release
+
+Another month, another release!
+
+Like the previous 2 releases, this is a beefy one: over 100 commits from 15
+contributors!

+<!-- more -->
+
+![Mastodon integration](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.13/picture.png)
+
+This one also marks the point of
+[1 year since our first v1](./v1.md)!
+
+### Highlights
+
+- `docker`, `docker buildx` and `podman` (on GoReleaser Pro) will now use the
+  image `digest` when creating `docker manifests`. This should help ensure that
+  what you are releasing wasn't changed by an outside tool.
+  - In the same token, the Docker images and manifests signing with `cosign`
+    will now use the `digest` by default.
+- GoReleaser can now announce to Mastodon!
+- Ability to create Arch Linux packages, _btw_.
+  - Still regarding nFPM, `dst`s with trailing slashes will now have the same
+    behavior as tools such as `cp` with trailing slashes.
+- For Windows fans: you can now create and publish `nupkg`s (Chocolatey
+  packages)!
+- Better support for building and publishing shared or static libraries.
+- Many bug fixes and documentation improvements.
+
+You can [install][] the same way you always do, and you can see the full release
+notes [here][oss-rel] and [here (for Pro)][pro-rel].

+
+#### GitHub Action incident
+
+Last Friday (Jan 27th), we had a rather big
+[incident](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser-action/pull/389) due to a
+GitHub website change. We were using a URL to get the release that was not in
+the API domain, but was working well for a couple of years. GitHub changed it,
+and we, as well as many other projects, got an incident in our hands. This is
+definitely our fault, though, we should have been using the guaranteed API
+endpoints instead. That said, we fixed it rather quickly, even though it was a
+Friday night. Since then, we also made more changes to use the `releases.json`
+served by our website instead of GitHub’s API, which also avoids rate limits and
+issues with GHE users. I also wanna give huge props to
+[@crazy-max](https://github.com/crazy-max) for working hard on all that, as well
+as everyone who helped debug and test everything on
+[#389](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser-action/pull/389).

+# Announcing GoReleaser v1.16 — the late February release
+
+The February release got a little late... _better later than even later, I guess!_ 😄
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+![goreleaser healthcheck](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.16/img.png)
+
+It is packed with some juicy features and tons of bug fixes and quality-of-life
+improvements.
+
+Let's take a look:
+
+### Highlights
+
+- On GoReleaser Pro you can now add dividers between groups in the changelog.
+  [Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/changelog/).
+- GoReleaser Pro also gets a new template variable: `{{ .Artifacts }}`, which
+  you can iterate over to build, for instance, custom scripts. Oh, how can you
+  build custom scripts? I'm glad you asked!
+  [Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/templates/#artifacts).
+- Concluding our Pro-exclusive feature-set for this release: template files! You
+  can template entire files, and they'll get added to the release!
+  [Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/templatefiles/).
+- All GoReleaser distributions get a new subcommand: `healthcheck`.
+  [Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/cmd/goreleaser_healthcheck/).
+- The single `build` statement has been undocumented for many years, and has
+  been deprecated.
+- You can now announce to OpenCollective.
+  [Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/announce/opencollective/).
+- Templating updates: `nfpms` get `{{ .ConventionalExtension }}`, new
+  templateable fields, `base` (as in `filepath.Base`) template function, and
+  more.
+- When running on a new project, with no `project_name` set, and no git remotes,
+  GoReleaser will now try to infer the project name from the `go.mod` file
+  instead of erroring.
+- GoReleaser is now built with Go 1.20.
+- As always, a lot of bug fixes, dependency updates and improvements!
+
+You can [install][] the same way you always do, and you can see the full release
+notes [here][oss-rel] and [here (for Pro)][pro-rel].

+
+### Other news
+

+
+The Easter release is here!
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+![better docker image build error output](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.17/img.png)
+
+It is packed with some juicy features and tons of bug fixes and quality-of-life
+improvements.
+
+Let's take a look:
+
+### Highlights
+
+- GoReleaser Pro now has a `templated_files` (or `templated_extra_files`) in
+  several fields: archives, blobs, checksum, custom_publishers, docker, nfpms,
+  release, snapcrafts and source
+- GoReleaser can now open pull requests of homebrew taps, brews and scoop
+  instead of just pushing it to a branch
+- Some smaller improvements in templates, like the new `.Now` and `.IsDraft`
+  template variables (tip: `{{ .Now.Format "2006" }}` to format the date time as
+  you want)
+- Default Parallelism now matches Linux container CPU
+- Some errors have been improved to be more clear on how to fix them
+- Many improvements in the documentation
+- As always, a lot of bug fixes, dependency updates and improvements!
+
+You can [install][] the same way you always do, and you can see the full release
+notes [here][oss-rel] and [here (for Pro)][pro-rel].

+# Announcing GoReleaser v1.18 — the maintainers month release
+
+May is the [maintainers month](https://maintainermonth.github.com), so I would
+first like to thank all the maintainers out there for the hard work, you rock!
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+![new goreleaser -v output (pro)](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.18/img1.png)
+
+Now, onto new features!
+
+## Highlights
+
+### Native `upx` support
+
+This version introduces a [`upx`][upx] root configuration section, which allows
+you to compress the binaries.
+
+Go built binaries are known for being, well, not small. There are a couple of
+strategies to remediate it, for example, passing `-s -w` as `-ldflags` to `go
+build` - which GoReleaser does by default since the beginning.
+
+I hope that, by making it easier to make the binaries even smaller, we get more
+projects to do that, better supporting environments with bad download speeds
+and/or low storage.
+
+For reference, running `upx` through GoReleaser binaries shrunk them from
+**~51M** to **~15M** - about **27%** of its original size.
+
+In a future release we'll also add more filters to the `upx` configuration.
+
+[Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/upx/).
+
+PS: if you use this on GitHub Actions, I recommend using
+[`crazy-max/ghaction-upx`](https://github.com/crazy-max/ghaction-upx) to install
+the latest and greatest [`upx`][upx] version!
+
+[upx]: https://upx.github.io/
+
+### Report binaries sizes
+
+Also related to binary sizes, you can now enable size reporting. After the build
+phase, GoReleaser will display the sizes and paths of all built artifacts.
+
+These sizes will also be available in `dist/artifacts.json`, so you might parse
+and export them somewhere else.
+
+[Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/reportsizes/).
+
+### Template improvements
+
+This is a recurrent subject in most releases, I know: more templateable fields!
+This release is not different in that regard:
+
+- New `{{ .IsGitDirty }}` template variable
+- `nfpms.*.package_name` now allows templates
+
+### Scoops
+
+To be in better parity with [`brews`][brews] and others, `scoop` is deprecated
+in favor of `scoops`, and you can now define multiple Scoop manifests in the
+same `.goreleaser.yaml` file.
+
+[Documentation](https://goreleaser.com/customization/scoop/).
+
+[brews]: https://goreleaser.com/customization/homebrew/
+
+### Publish Homebrew taps, Scoop manifests and Krew plugins to plain Git repositores
+
+Historically, you could only publish to GitHub, GitLab and Gitea, which used
+their respective APIs.
+
+Now, you can push to any Git repository. This can be specially useful for people
+self-hosting Git servers, like [Soft Serve][soft] for example.
+
+[soft]: https://charm.sh/soft-serve
+
+Documentation:
+
+- [Homebrew Taps](https://goreleaser.com/customization/homebrew/).
+- [Scoops Manifests](https://goreleaser.com/customization/scoop/).
+- [Krew Plugin Manifests](https://goreleaser.com/customization/krew/)
+
+### Deprecation warnings rolled out
+
+On GoReleaser Pro, the initial way to access custom environment variables was
+`{{.var_name}}`. That could conflict with GoReleaser's internal state, and was
+deprecated in favor of `{{.Var.var_name}}`.
+
+Now, the old way is officially removed for good.
+
+### Output improvements
+
+I always aim for the GoReleaser output to be concise yet complete-ish.
+
+This release contains a few improvements in that regard, like the removal of
+sorting the `log` keys alphabetically, so they are displayed in the intended
+order.
+
+Another change is in printing the artifacts' path: it will now, when possible,
+use relative paths in order to make the output a bit better.
+
+Last but not least, we have a new `goreleaser --version` output using
+[go-version](https://github.com/caarlos0/go-version):
+
+{{< img caption="new goreleaser -v output" src="img2.png" >}}
+
+It's not much, but it's honest work!
+
+### Check multiple configuration files
+
+GoReleaser Pro allows you to include configuration files, which might lead to
+[repositories of reusable `.goreleaser.yaml` files
+parts](https://github.com/caarlos0/goreleaserfiles).
+
+One of the advantages of this is being able to, for example, change some
+configuration in a single place and that is then applied to all the projects
+that use that file.
+
+The problem is that `goreleaser check` only ever allowed to check one file at a
+time.
+
+On v1.18 we added the ability to, instead, pass as many configuration files you
+need as arguments. This also allows you to use shell globs, e.g.:
+
+```bash
+goreleaser check goreleaser*.yaml
+```
+
+You can then add this to your CI, so your GoReleaser configuration files are
+always validated and hopefully free of deprecation notices. 🤝
+
+### No AUR for v1.18.0
+
+I'm not sure if AUR is under maintainance or if there something else going on,
+but I'm unable to clone my AUR packages using their private URLs.
+
+I didn't want to hold the release because of it, so I'll be releasing a patch as
+soon as the problem is fixed, whatever the problem is.
+
+Thanks for the comprehension. 😃

+# Announcing GoReleaser v1.19 — the big release
+
+Almost 200 commits adding Nix, Winget, and much more...
+
+<!-- more -->
+
+This release took almost **2 months** (!), and I hope the wait was worth it!
+
+Without further ado, let's dive in!
+
+## Highlights
+
+### Security improvements
+
+We got a [CVE on nFPM](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/security/advisories/GHSA-w7jw-q4fg-qc4c)
+and another one [on
+GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/security/advisories/GHSA-2fvp-53hw-f9fc).
+
+It is unlikely that you were affected by this, but it's worth taking a look just
+in case.
+
+**Both incidents were fixed in this release.**
+
+### Open pull requests for Homebrew, Krew, Scoop
+
+You can now instead of just pushing to a branch, push and open a pull request.
+It even works cross-repository!
+
+Here's an example:
+
+```yaml
+# .goreleaser.yml
+brews: # can be brews, krew, scoops, etc...
+  - # ...
+    repository:
+      owner: john
+      name: repo
+      branch: "{{.ProjectName}}-{{.Version}}"
+      pull_request:
+        enabled: true
+        base:
+          owner: mike
+          name: repo
+          branch: main
+```
+
+GoReleaser will also read the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and prepend it
+to the PR description if it exists!
+
+### Nix
+
+We added support to generate Nixpkgs.
+We **don't** generate Nixpkgs that compile from source, though.
+
+Instead, we use the already built archives.
+
+This decision was made because this way we can support closed-source software as
+well as Open Source.
+The idea here is that you create your own [NUR][] and instruct your users to
+install from there.
+
+[NUR]: https://github.com/nix-community/NUR
+
+Example:
+
+```yaml
+# .goreleaser.yml
+nix:
+  - name: goreleaser-pro
+    repository:
+      owner: goreleaser
+      name: nur
+    homepage: https://goreleaser.com
+    description: Deliver Go binaries as fast and easily as possible
+    license: unfree
+    install: |-
+      mkdir -p $out/bin
+      cp -vr ./goreleaser $out/bin/goreleaser
+      installManPage ./manpages/goreleaser.1.gz
+      installShellCompletion ./completions/*
+```
+
+### Winget
+
+Now that Winget supports installing `zip` packages, GoReleaser added support to
+generate the needed manifests, and you can then PR them to
+`microsoft/winget-pkgs`.
+
+![winget-installed goreleaser on windows](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.19/pic.jpg)
+
+Example:
+
+```yaml
+# .goreleaser.yml
+winget:
+  - name: goreleaser-pro
+    publisher: goreleaser
+    license: Copyright Becker Software LTDA
+    copyright: Becker Software LTDA
+    homepage: https://goreleaser.com
+    short_description: Deliver Go binaries as fast and easily as possible
+    repository:
+      owner: goreleaser
+      name: winget-pkgs
+      branch: "goreleaser-pro-{{.Version}}"
+      pull_request:
+        enabled: true
+        draft: true
+        base:
+          owner: microsoft
+          name: winget-pkgs
+          branch: master
+```
+
+PS: when you open a PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, you are expected to fill the
+PR template there... Don't forget to do it! 😄
+
+### Ko improvements
+
+The Ko pipe will now ignore empty tags (e.g. if a template evaluate to an empty
+string).
+
+Ko also now properly registers its manifests within GoReleaser's context, so you
+can sign them with `docker_signs`.
+
+### Deprecations that were permanently removed
+
+Some things that were deprecated for over 6 months were removed in this release:
+
+- `archives.replacements`
+- `archives.rlcp`
+
+There are also other deprecations to be removed soon!
+
+Check the [deprecations][] page to find out more, and run `goreleaser check`
+every now and then to see if your configuration file is good!
+
+[deprecations]: https://goreleaser.com/deprecations
+
+### Templates
+
+More fields now accept templates:
+
+- `dockers.skip_push`
+- `docker_manifests.skip_push`
+- `scoops.description`
+- `scoops.homepage`
+- `snapcrafts.title`
+- `snapcrafts.icon`
+- `snapcrafts.assumes`
+- `snapcrafts.hooks`
+
+On the same token, there are a couple of new template functions and fields:
+
+- `{{.IsNightly}}` (always false on OSS)
+- `{{.Checksums}}` can be used in the release body template
+- `{{envOrDefault "FOO" "bar" }}` returns the value of `$FOO` if it is set,
+  otherwise returns `bar`
+
+### Standard repository
+
+Historically, you would set `brews.tap`, `krews.index` and etc.
+Internally, they all used the same structure: a repository.
+"A repository" is also (probably) how most think about these fields.
+
+To make things easier on everyone, now all those fields are named `repository`
+instead.
+
+You can check the [deprecations][] page to find more information.
+
+### Continue on error
+
+From this version onward, GoReleaser will not hard-stop when Homebrew, Nix, and
+other pipes fail to publish.
+
+Our understanding is that having a broken, stopped-in-the-middle release, is
+worse than continuing and reporting all the errors in the end, so you can fix
+them all in a single pass and do a point-release.
+
+You can still get the previous behavior by passing the `--fail-fast` flag.
+
+### Upx
+
+As promised, `upx` now has more filters: `goos`, `goarch`, `goarm` and
+`goamd64`.
+
+### Telegram
+
+The Telegram announcer now supports choosing the message format.
+
+You can also use `mdv2escape` to escape sequences accordingly to `mdv2`.
+
+### Changelog
+
+Besides just excluding commits that match some regular expressions, you can now
+include **only** the commits that match one of them.
+
+Example:
+
+```yaml
+# .goreleaser.yml
+changelog:
+  filters:
+    include:
+      - "^feat.*"
+      - "^fix.*"
+```
+
+### Bugfixes et al
+
+We also had a bunch of bugfixes and documentation improvements, as always.
+
+## Other news
+
+- GoReleaser now has ~11.8k stars and 340 contributors! Thanks, everyone!
+- We eventually discuss new features in our Discord server. 
+  [Join the conversation](https://goreleaser.com/discord)!

+![Releasing...](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/goreleaser-v1.20/pic.png)
+
+### Nightlies
+
+I've been releasing [GoReleaser Pro Nightlies][pro-nightly] for a while now, but
+it never had a fixed schedule, and the OSS version never had a nightly release
+either.
+
+Starting now, the Pro Nightly will be released every Wednesday, and the OSS
+every Thursday.
+
+[pro-nightly]: https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser-pro/releases/tag/nightly

+- HTTP & Artifactory upload matrix
+- nFPM `templated_scripts`
+- `goreleaser release --single-target`
+- Release's footer/header can be set to file paths/URLs in the configuration file
+
+### Nix
+
+[We added Nix support in the previous release](./v1.19.md),
+and in this one we added a few improvements:
+
+- `zip` support
+- the ability to define runtime dependencies
+- make it easier to extend with a new `extra_install` option
+
+### `extra_install`
+
+Speaking of extra install instructions, we added this option to brew too.
+
+### `mod_timestamp`
+
+We added the ability to set a `mod_timestamp` to both metadata files and to
+universal binaries.
+
+### Other improvements and bug fixes
+
+This release also adds a few other small improvements, here's a few of them:
+
+- Scoops now support `arm64`
+- Winget got the `PortableCommandAlias` option
+- Release on GitHub now has the `make_latest` option
+- You can now disable custom publishers using templates
+- `goreleaser init` and overall `goreleaser release` output improvements
