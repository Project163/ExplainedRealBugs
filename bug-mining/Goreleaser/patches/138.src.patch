+# Git is currently in a dirty state
+
+GoReleaser requires a clean git state to work.
+
+If you see this error, it means that something in your build process is either creating or editing files before GoReleaser is called.
+The error message should show you which files were created/modified.
+
+Here's an example error:
+
+```sh
+   ⨯ release failed after 0.02s error=git is currently in a dirty state
+Please check in your pipeline what can be changing the following files:
+ M modified.go
+?? created.txt
+
+Learn more at https://goreleaser.com/errors/dirty
+```
+
+From here on, you have a couple of options:
+
+- add the file to `.gitignore` (recommended if the file is temporary and/or generated);
+- change your process the build process to not touch any git tracked files.
