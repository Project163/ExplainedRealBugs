+# How it works
+
+GoReleaser goal is to automate most of the boring work you'll had while releasing software.
+Ideally, using sensible defaults and making the most common usecases easy.
+
+GoReleaser expects a couple of things:
+
+- a `.goreleaser.yml` file with the configuration (see the [customization section](/customization) for more info)
+- a clean working tree
+- a SemVer-compatible version (e.g. `10.21.34-something`)
+
+And that's it.
+
+## What happens when you release
+
+A GoReleaser run is split into 4 major steps:
+
+- **defaulting**: configures sensible defaults for each step
+- **building**: builds the binaries, archives, packages, Docker images, etc
+- **publishing**: publishes the release to the configured SCM, Docker registries, blob storages...
+- **announcing**: announces your release to the configured channels
+
+Some steps might be skipped with `--skip-foo`-like flags (check the [command line docs](/cmd/goreleaser/) for details).
+
+If any of the previous steps fails, the next steps will not run.
