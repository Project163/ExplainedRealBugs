-By default GoReleaser will build the current directory, but you can change
-the package path in the GoReleaser configuration file:
+Run `goreleaser init` to create an example `.goreleaser.yaml` file:
 
-```yml
-# .goreleaser.yml
-# Build customization
-builds:
-  - binary: drum-roll
-    goos:
-      - windows
-      - darwin
-      - linux
-    goarch:
-      - amd64
-```
-
-GoReleaser skips invalid GOOS/GOARCH combinations.
-
-With the above configuration the name of all created binaries will be `drum-roll`
-and GoReleaser will build one binary in 64bit architecture for each of the operating systems Windows, Linux and MacOS.
+```console
+$ goreleaser init
 
-GoReleaser will then archive the resulting binaries of each OS/Arch pair into a
-separate file. The default format is `{{.ProjectName}}_{{.Os}}_{{.Arch}}`.
-You can change the archive's name and format. You can also replace the OS
-and the Architecture with your own.

 If you don't want to create a tag yet, you can also create a release
