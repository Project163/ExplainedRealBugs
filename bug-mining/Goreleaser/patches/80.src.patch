+You can install the pre-compiled binary, use Docker or compile from source.
+
+## Install the pre-compiled binary
+
+**homebrew tap**:
+
+```sh
+$ brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser
+```
+
+**homebrew** (may not be the latest version):
+
+```sh
+$ brew install goreleaser
+```
+
+**snapcraft**:
+
+```sh
+$ snap install goreleaser
+```
+
+**scoop**:
+
+```sh
+$ scoop bucket add goreleaser https://github.com/goreleaser/scoop-bucket.git
+$ scoop install goreleaser
+```
+
+**deb/rpm**:
+
+Download the `.deb` or `.rpm` from the [releases page][releases] and
+install with `dpkg -i` and `rpm -i` respectively.
+
+**manually**:
+
+Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page][releases] and
+copy to the desired location.
+
+## Running with Docker
+
+You can use Docker to do simple releases. Currently, the provided docker
+image does not provide support for snapcraft.
+
+```sh
+$ docker run --rm --privileged \
+  -v $PWD:/go/src/github.com/user/repo \
+  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
+  -w /go/src/github.com/user/repo \
+  -e GITHUB_TOKEN \
+  -e DOCKER_USERNAME \
+  -e DOCKER_PASSWORD \
+  goreleaser/goreleaser release
+```
+
+Note that the image will almost always have the last stable Go version.
+
+If you need more things, you are encouraged to have your own image. You can
+always use GoReleaser's [own Dockerfile][dockerfile] as an example though.
+
+[dockerfile]: https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/master/Dockerfile
+[releases]: https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases
+
+## Compiling from source
+
+> **Note**: this method requires Go 1.11+.
+
+```sh
+$ git clone git@github.com:goreleaser/goreleaser.git
+$ cd goreleaser
+$ make setup build
+```
+
+After that, the `goreleaser` binary will be in the root folder:
+
+```sh
+$ ./goreleaser --help
+```

 publish steps while providing variant customization options for all steps.
 
 GoReleaser is built for CI tools; you only need to
-[download and execute it](#ci_integration) in your build script.
-You can [customize](#Customization) your release process by

+
+You can [customize](/customization) your release process by
 creating a `.goreleaser.yml` file.
 
 The idea started with a
 [simple shell script](https://github.com/goreleaser/old-go-releaser),
 but it quickly became more complex and I also wanted to publish binaries via
-Homebrew taps, which would have made the script even more hacky, so I let go of
-that and rewrote the whole thing in Go.
-
-## Installing Goreleaser
-
-There are three ways to get going install GoReleaser:
-
-### Using homebrew
-
-```sh
-brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser
-```
-
-### Using snapcraft
-
-```sh
-snap install goreleaser
-```
-
-### Using Scoop
-
-```sh
-scoop bucket add goreleaser https://github.com/goreleaser/scoop-bucket.git
-scoop install goreleaser
-```
-
-> Check the [tap source](https://github.com/goreleaser/homebrew-tap) for
-> more details.
-
-### Using Docker
-
-You can use Docker to do simple releases. Currently, the provided docker
-image does not provide support for snapcraft.
-
-```console
-$ docker run --rm --privileged \
-  -v $PWD:/go/src/github.com/user/repo \
-  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-  -w /go/src/github.com/user/repo \
-  -e GITHUB_TOKEN \
-  -e DOCKER_USERNAME \
-  -e DOCKER_PASSWORD \
-  goreleaser/goreleaser release
-```

-[dockerfile]: https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/blob/master/Dockerfile
-
-## Manually
-
-Download your preferred flavor from the [releases page](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases/latest) and install
-manually.
-
-### Using go get
-
-Note: this method requires Go 1.10+.
-
-```console
-$ go get -d github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser
-$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser
-$ dep ensure -vendor-only
-$ make setup build
-```
+Homebrew taps, which would have made the script even more "hacky", so I let
+go of that and rewrote the whole thing in Go.
 
-It is recommended to also run `dep ensure` to make sure that the dependencies
-are in the correct versions.
