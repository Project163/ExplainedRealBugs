The `sectionId` value normally tracks the original z.  All `layout` data elements should remain immutable after initial import.\r\n- The `width` and `height` values should reflect the pixel size of the original source image and should remain immutable after initial import.\r\n- The bounding box values (`minX`, `minY`, `maxX`, `maxY`) reflect the pixel bounds of the tile in world space after all transformations have been applied to the tile.  These values (typically) should not be explicitly specified and are derived/calculated by render-ws when you import tile specs.  These values change with each alignment as the transforms change.\r\n- The `stackResolutionX/Y/Z` values identify pixels per nm (or whatever unit you prefer) in each dimension.  They are not needed or used by render for anything.  However, they can be useful to other clients like viewers (e.g. CATMAID or neuroglancer) that have physical dimension scale bars in their UIs.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nEric  ","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/comments/726765864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautmane","id":4457104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTcxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4457104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane","html_url":"https://github.com/trautmane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/comments/726774052","html_url":"https://github.com/saalfeldlab/render/issues/112#issuecomment-726774052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/112","id":726774052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNjc3NDA1Mg==","user":{"login":"trautmane","id":4457104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTcxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4457104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane","html_url":"https://github.com/trautmane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-13T13:48:14Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T13:48:14Z","body":"It looks like `pixelsize` is something @fcollman added to the python client (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/render-python/blob/master/renderapi/layout.py#L52-L55).
