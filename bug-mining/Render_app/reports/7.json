I was wondering if instead the tilespec could have an options 'default_channel' option, or the stack could have a 'default_channel' metadata option that if defined would control which channel is used for rendering in cases when none is given?\r\n\r\nRight now i have to manage adding a default channel to all my stacks, and then my modules which do image specific operations either have to remember which channel is my default channel and update the tilespec with the new image path, but either redo the work on the default image pyramid or go check based upon which imageUrl matches which is the default channel... it would be much cleaner to just leave the default image pyramid blank and only fill in channels... the only problem is that then there is some unreliable ordering of the channels lists and so which channel is first and gets displayed on default is mixed/confused.  \r\n\r\nthoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"trautmane","id":4457104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTcxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4457104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane","html_url":"https://github.com/trautmane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
