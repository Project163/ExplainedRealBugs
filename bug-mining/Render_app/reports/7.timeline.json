Would that work for you?\r\n\r\nWhen you say 'default image-pyramid defined', are you referring to the older/original single channel tile spec format with the \"mipmapLevels\" element at the \"root\" of the tile spec?\r\nMy intent was to ultimately deprecate/retire that format and require the newer format with the root \"channels\" element - I think that is what you mean by \"it would be much cleaner to just leave the default image pyramid blank and only fill in channels\" - right?\r\n\r\nI'm also curious about your \"unreliable ordering\" statement.  As long as all tile specs have channels specified in the same order, the first channel should always be the same - but maybe there is a bug or some kind of parsing \"feature\" I missed :).  If you have a small example, I'd be interested in it (if not, no worries).  This becomes less important if we define a stack default channel name, but I'd still need to fall back to this logic in the absence of stack default channel name.\r\n    ","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/comments/416263216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautmane","id":4457104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTcxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4457104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane","html_url":"https://github.com/trautmane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautmane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/comments/416362958","html_url":"https://github.com/saalfeldlab/render/issues/90#issuecomment-416362958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/render/issues/90","id":416362958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjM2Mjk1OA==","user":{"login":"fcollman","id":782341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MjM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/782341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman","html_url":"https://github.com/fcollman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fcollman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-27T20:46:29Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T20:46:29Z","body":"Yes.. adding it as stackmetadata would work for me.\r\n\r\nyes, the default image pyramid i meant the original/older single channel tilespec format. I think we are on the same page here.\r\n\r\nI don't have an example at my fingertips, but I do remember a stack where i had half the tiles in ndviz showing up with one channel and another with another, but i had used one set of code to upload all those channels.  It may have been that there was some ordering in my code that setup that tilespec that i wasn't aware of, so i'm not sure where the problem is.
