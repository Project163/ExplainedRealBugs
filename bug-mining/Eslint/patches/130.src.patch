 # Disallows unnecessary `return await` (no-return-await)
 
-Inside an `async function`, `return await` is useless. Since the return value of an `async function` is always wrapped in `Promise.resolve`, `return await` doesn't actually do anything except add extra time before the overarching Promise resolves or rejects. This pattern is almost certainly due to programmer ignorance of the return semantics of `async function`s.
+Inside an `async function`, `return await` is seldom useful. Since the return value of an `async function` is always wrapped in `Promise.resolve`, `return await` doesn’t actually do anything except add extra time before the overarching Promise resolves or rejects. The only valid exception is if `return await` is used in a try/catch statement to catch errors from another Promise-based function.
