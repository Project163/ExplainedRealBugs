+#### Conflicting Fixes
+
+Conflicting fixes are fixes that apply different changes to the same part of the source code.
+There is no way to specify which of the conflicting fixes is applied.
+
+For example, if two fixes want to modify characters 0 through 5, only one is applied.

 ### Providing Suggestions
 
 In some cases fixes aren't appropriate to be automatically applied, for example, if a fix potentially changes functionality or if there are multiple valid ways to fix a rule depending on the implementation intent (see the best practices for [applying fixes](#applying-fixes) listed above). In these cases, there is an alternative `suggest` option on `context.report()` that allows other tools, such as editors, to expose helpers for users to manually apply a suggestion.
