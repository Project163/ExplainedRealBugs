+Assignment to variables declared as function parameters can be misleading and lead to confusing behavior, as modifying function parameters will also mutate the `arguments` object when not in strict mode (see [When Not To Use It](#when-not-to-use-it) below). Often, assignment to function parameters is unintended and indicative of a mistake or programmer error.
 
 This rule can be also configured to fail when function parameters are modified. Side effects on parameters can cause counter-intuitive execution flow and make errors difficult to track down.

 ## When Not To Use It
 
 If you want to allow assignment to function parameters, then you can safely disable this rule.
+
+Strict mode code doesn't sync indices of the arguments object with each parameter binding. Therefore, this rule is not necessary to protect against arguments object mutation in ESM modules or other strict mode functions.
