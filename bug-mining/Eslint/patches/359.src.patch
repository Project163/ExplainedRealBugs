 ESLint supports `.eslintignore` files to exclude files from the linting process when ESLint operates on a directory. Files given as individual CLI arguments will be exempt from exclusion. The `.eslintignore` file is a plain text file containing one pattern per line. It can be located in any of the target directory's ancestors; it will affect files in its containing directory as well as all sub-directories. Here's a simple example of a `.eslintignore` file:
 
-    node_modules/*
+    temp.js
     **/vendor/*.js
 
 A more detailed breakdown of supported patterns and directories ESLint ignores by default can be found in [Configuring ESLint](configuring.md#ignoring-files-and-directories).
