 There are two ways to use configuration files.
 
-The first way to use configuration files is via `.eslintrc.*` and `package.json` files. ESLint will automatically look for them in the directory of the file to be linted, and in successive parent directories all the way up to the root directory of the filesystem (unless `root: true` is specified). Configuration files can be useful when you want different configurations for different parts of a project or when you want others to be able to use ESLint directly without needing to remember to pass in the configuration file.

ESLint will automatically look for them in the directory of the file to be linted, and in successive parent directories all the way up to the root directory of the filesystem (`/`), the home directory of the current user (`~/`), or when `root: true` is specified. See [Cascading and Hierarchy](#cascading-and-hierarchy) below for more details on this.

 ## Extending Configuration Files
 
 A configuration file, once extended, can inherit all the traits of another configuration file (including rules, plugins, and language options) and modify all the options. As a result, there are three configurations, as defined below:
