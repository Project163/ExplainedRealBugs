+
+The ESLint core rules are the rules included in the ESLint package.
+
+## Rule Writing Documentation
+
+For full reference information on writing rules, refer to [Custom Rules](../extend/custom-rules). Both custom rules and core rules have the same API. The primary difference between core and custom rules are:
+
+1. Core rules are included in the `eslint` package.
+1. Core rules must adhere to the conventions documented on this page.
+
+## File Structure
+
+Each core rule in ESLint has three files named with its identifier (for example, `no-extra-semi`).
+
+* in the `lib/rules` directory: a source file (for example, `no-extra-semi.js`)
+* in the `tests/lib/rules` directory: a test file (for example, `no-extra-semi.js`)
+* in the `docs/src/rules` directory: a Markdown documentation file (for example, `no-extra-semi.md`)
+
+**Important:** If you submit a core rule to the ESLint repository, you **must** follow the conventions explained below.
+
+Here is the basic format of the source file for a rule:
+
+```js
+/**
+ * @fileoverview Rule to disallow unnecessary semicolons
+ * @author Nicholas C. Zakas
+ */
+
+"use strict";
+
+//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+// Rule Definition
+//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+/** @type {import('../shared/types').Rule} */
+module.exports = {
+    meta: {
+        type: "suggestion",
+
+        docs: {
+            description: "disallow unnecessary semicolons",
+            recommended: true,
+            url: "https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-extra-semi"
+        },
+        fixable: "code",
+        schema: [] // no options
+    },
+    create: function(context) {
+        return {
+            // callback functions
+        };
+    }
+};
+```
+
+## Rule Unit Tests
+
+Each bundled rule for ESLint core must have a set of unit tests submitted with it to be accepted. The test file is named the same as the source file but lives in `tests/lib/`. For example, if the rule source file is `lib/rules/foo.js` then the test file should be `tests/lib/rules/foo.js`.
+
+ESLint provides the [`RuleTester`](../integrate/nodejs-api#ruletester) utility to make it easy to write tests for rules.
+
+## Performance Testing
+
+To keep the linting process efficient and unobtrusive, it is useful to verify the performance impact of new rules or modifications to existing rules.
+
+To learn how to profile the performance of individual rules, refer to [Profile Rule Performance](../extend/custom-rules#profile-rule-performance) in the custom rules documentation.
+
+When developing in the ESLint core repository, the `npm run perf` command gives a high-level overview of ESLint running time with all core rules enabled.
+
+```bash
+$ git checkout main
+Switched to branch 'main'
+
+$ npm run perf
+CPU Speed is 2200 with multiplier 7500000
+Performance Run #1:  1394.689313ms

+Performance budget ok:  1443.736547ms (limit: 3409.090909090909ms)
+```
+
+## Rule Naming Conventions
+
+The rule naming conventions for ESLint are as follows:
+
+* Use dashes between words.
+* If your rule only disallows something, prefix it with `no-` such as `no-eval` for disallowing `eval()` and `no-debugger` for disallowing `debugger`.
+* If your rule is enforcing the inclusion of something, use a short name without a special prefix.

+1. Place all of your runtime rules in the same directory (e.g., `eslint_rules`).
+2. Create a [configuration file](../use/configure/) and specify your rule ID error level under the `rules` key. Your rule will not run unless it has a value of `"warn"` or `"error"` in the configuration file.
+3. Run the [command line interface](../use/command-line-interface) using the `--rulesdir` option to specify the location of your runtime rules.
