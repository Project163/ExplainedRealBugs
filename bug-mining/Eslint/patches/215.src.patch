 # Disallow Use of `__proto__` (no-proto)
 
-`__proto__` property has been deprecated as of ECMAScript 3.1 and shouldn't be used in the code. Use `getPrototypeOf` method instead.
+`__proto__` property has been deprecated as of ECMAScript 3.1 and shouldn't be used in the code. Use `Object.getPrototypeOf` and `Object.setPrototypeOf` instead.
 
 ## Rule Details
 
-When an object is created `__proto__` is set to the original prototype property of the object’s constructor function. `getPrototypeOf` is the preferred method of getting "the prototype".
+When an object is created with the `new` operator, `__proto__` is set to the original "prototype" property of the object's constructor function. `Object.getPrototypeOf` is the preferred method of getting the object's prototype. To change an object's prototype, use `Object.setPrototypeOf`.

 ## When Not To Use It
 
-If you need to support legacy browsers, you might want to turn this rule off, since support for `getPrototypeOf` is not yet universal.
