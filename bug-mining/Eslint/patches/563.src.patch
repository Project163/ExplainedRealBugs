 ## Reference Information
 
+### Directory Structure
+
+The ESLint directory and file structure is as follows:
+
+* `bin` - executable files that are available when ESLint is installed
+* `conf` - default configuration information
+* `docs` - documentation for the project
+* `lib` - contains the source code
+    * `formatters` - all source files defining formatters
+    * `rules` - all source files defining rules
+* `tests` - the main unit test folder
+    * `lib` - tests for the source code
+        * `formatters` - tests for the formatters
+        * `rules` - tests for the rules
+
 ### Workflow
 
 Once you have your development environment installed, you can make and submit changes to the ESLint source files. Doing this successfully requires careful adherence to our [pull-request submission workflow](./pull-requests).

-## [Get the Source Code](source-code)
-
-Before you can get started developing ESLint, you'll need to get a copy of the ESLint source code. This section explains how to do that and a little about the source code structure.

 ## [Set up a Development Environment](development-environment)
 
 Developing for ESLint is a bit different than running it on the command line. This section shows you how to set up a development environment and get you ready to write code.

-ESLint is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control. In order to obtain the source code, you must first install Git on your system. Instructions for installing and setting up Git can be found at <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/>.
-
-If you simply want to create a local copy of the source to play with, you can clone the main repository using this command:
-
-```shell
-git clone git://github.com/eslint/eslint.git
-```
-
-If you're planning on contributing to ESLint, then it's a good idea to fork the repository. You can find instructions for forking a repository at <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>. After forking the ESLint repository, you'll want to create a local copy of your fork.

-## Start Developing
-
-Before you can get started developing, you'll need to have a couple of things installed:
-
-* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org)
-* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-
-Once you have a local copy and have Node.JS and npm installed, you'll need to install the ESLint dependencies:
-
-```shell
-cd eslint
-npm install
-```
-
-Now when you run `eslint`, it will be running your local copy and showing your changes.
-
-**Note:** It's a good idea to re-run `npm install` whenever you pull from the main repository to ensure you have the latest development dependencies.
