 This rule has an object option:
 
-* `"beforeColon": false` (default) disallows spaces between the key and the colon in object literals.
-* `"beforeColon": true` requires at least one space between the key and the colon in object literals.
-* `"afterColon": true` (default) requires at least one space between the colon and the value in object literals.
-* `"afterColon": false` disallows spaces between the colon and the value in object literals.
-* `"mode": "strict"` (default) enforces exactly one space before or after colons in object literals.
-* `"mode": "minimum"` enforces one or more spaces before or after colons in object literals.
-* `"align": "value"` enforces horizontal alignment of values in object literals.
-* `"align": "colon"` enforces horizontal alignment of both colons and values in object literals.
+* `"beforeColon": false (default) | true`
+    * `false`: disallows spaces between the key and the colon in object literals.
+    * `true`: requires at least one space between the key and the colon in object literals.
+* `"afterColon": true (default) | false`
+    * `true`: requires at least one space between the colon and the value in object literals.
+    * `false`: disallows spaces between the colon and the value in object literals.
+* `"mode": "strict" (default) | "miniumum"`
+    * `"strict"`: enforces exactly one space before or after colons in object literals.
+    * `"minimum"`: enforces one or more spaces before or after colons in object literals.
+* `"align": "value" | "colon"`
+    * `"value"`: enforces horizontal alignment of values in object literals.
+    * `"colon"` enforces horizontal alignment of both colons and values in object literals.
 * `"align"` with an object value allows for fine-grained spacing when values are being aligned in object literals.
 * `"singleLine"` specifies a spacing style for single-line object literals.
 * `"multiLine"` specifies a spacing style for multi-line object literals.
