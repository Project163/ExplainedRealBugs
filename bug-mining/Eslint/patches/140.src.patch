 **Note:** If you run ESLint with `--cache` and then run ESLint without `--cache`, the `.eslintcache` file will be deleted. This is necessary because the results of the lint might change and make `.eslintcache` invalid. If you want to control when the cache file is deleted, then use `--cache-location` to specify an alternate location for the cache file.
 
-**Note:**: As of now, only the results for successfully linted files are stored in the cache. Files which fail linting are not stored in the cache, so they will be linted every time.
+**Note:**: Autofixed files are not placed in the cache. Subsequent linting that does not trigger an autofix will place it in the cache.
