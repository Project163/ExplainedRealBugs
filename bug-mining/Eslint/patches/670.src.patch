 According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `"eslint": "~3.1.0"` to guarantee the results of your builds.
 
-## Stylistic Rule Updates
-
-Stylistic rules are frozen according to [our policy](https://eslint.org/blog/2020/05/changes-to-rules-policies) on how we evaluate new rules and rule changes.
-This means:
-
-* **Bug fixes**: We will still fix bugs in stylistic rules.
-* **New ECMAScript features**: We will also make sure stylistic rules are compatible with new ECMAScript features.
-* **New options**: We will **not** add any new options to stylistic rules unless an option is the only way to fix a bug or support a newly-added ECMAScript feature.

 * Use dashes between words.
 * If your rule only disallows something, prefix it with `no-` such as `no-eval` for disallowing `eval()` and `no-debugger` for disallowing `debugger`.
 * If your rule is enforcing the inclusion of something, use a short name without a special prefix.

+## Frozen Rules
+
+When rules are feature complete, they are marked as frozen (indicated with ❄️ in the documentation). Rules are considered feature complete when the intended purpose of the rule has been fully implemented such that it catches 80% or more of expected violations and covers the majority of common exceptions. After that point, we expect users to use [disable comments](../use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments-1) when they find an edge case that isn't covered.
+
+When a rule is frozen, it means:
+
+* **Bug fixes**: We will still fix confirmed bugs.
+* **New ECMAScript features**: We will ensure compatibility with new ECMAScript features, meaning the rule will not break on new syntax.
+* **New options**: We will **not** add any new options unless an option is the only way to fix a bug or support a newly-added ECMAScript feature.
+
+If you find that a frozen rule would work better for you with a change, we recommend copying the rule source code and modifying it to fit your needs.
