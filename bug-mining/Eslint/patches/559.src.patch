 ESLint is all about rules. For most of the project's lifetime, we've had over 200 rules, and that list continues to grow. However, we can't just accept any proposed rule because all rules need to work cohesively together. As such, we have some guidelines around which rules can be part of the ESLint core and which are better off as custom rules and plugins.

 ## Alternative: Creating Your Own Rules
 
-Remember that ESLint is completely pluggable, which means you can create your own rules and distribute them using plugins. We did this on purpose because we don't want to be the gatekeepers for all possible rules. Even if we don't accept a rule into the core, that doesn't mean you can't have the exact rule that you want. See the [working with rules](../extend/custom-rules) and [working with plugins](../extend/plugins) documentation for more information.

 If you want to contribute to an ESLint repo, please use a GitHub pull request. This is the fastest way for us to evaluate your code and to merge it into the code base. Please don't file an issue with snippets of code. Doing so means that we need to manually merge the changes in and update any appropriate tests. That decreases the likelihood that your code is going to get included in a timely manner. Please use pull requests.

The most complete documentation on the labels is found in the [Maintain ESLint documentation](../maintain/manage-issues#when-an-issue-is-opened), but most contributors should find the information on this page sufficient. The most important questions that labels can help you, as a contributor, answer are:
 
 1. Is this issue available for me to work on? If you have little or no experience contributing to ESLint, the [`good first issue`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/labels/good%20first%20issue) label marks appropriate issues. Otherwise, the [`help wanted`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/labels/help%20wanted) label is an invitation to work on the issue. If you have more experience, you can try working on other issues labeled [`accepted`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/labels/accepted). Conversely, issues not yet ready to work on are labeled `triage`, `evaluating`, and/or `needs bikeshedding`, and issues that cannot currently be worked on because of something else, such as a bug in a dependency, are labeled `blocked`.
-1. What is this issue about? Labels describing the nature of issues include `bug`, `enhancement`, `feature`, `question`, `rule`, `documentation`, `core`, `build`, `cli`, `infrastructure`, `breaking`, and `chore`. These are documented in the [Maintainer Guide](../maintain/manage-issues#types-of-issues).

 While ESLint is designed to be run on the command line, it's possible to use ESLint programmatically through the Node.js API. The purpose of the Node.js API is to allow plugin and tool authors to use the ESLint functionality directly, without going through the command line interface.
