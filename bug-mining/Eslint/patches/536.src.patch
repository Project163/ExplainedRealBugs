 ### Using plugins in your configuration
 
-Plugins are used to share rules, processors, configurations, parsers, and more across ESLint projects. Plugins are specified in a configuration object using the `plugins` key, which is an object where the name of the plugin is the property name and the value is the plugin object itself. Here's an example:

+#### Using plugin rules

+You can use specific rules included in a plugin. To do this, specify the plugin
+in a configuration object using the `plugins` key. The value for the `plugin` key
+is an object where the name of the plugin is the property name and the value is the plugin object itself. Here's an example:

 This configuration object uses `jsd` as the prefix plugin instead of `jsdoc`.
 
+#### Using configurations included in plugins
+
+You can use a configuration included in a plugin by adding that configuration
+directly to the `eslint.config.js` configurations array.
+Often, you do this for a plugin's recommended configuration. Here's an example:
+
+```js
+import jsdoc from "eslint-plugin-jsdoc";

+export default [
+    // configuration included in plugin

+            "jsdoc/require-description": "warn",
+        }
+    }
+];

 ### Using processors
 
 Processors allow ESLint to transform text into pieces of code that ESLint can lint. You can specify the processor to use for a given file type by defining a `processor` property that contains either the processor name in the format `"pluginName/processorName"` to reference a processor in a plugin or an object containing both a `preprocess()` and a `postprocess()` method. For example, to extract JavaScript code blocks from a Markdown file, you might add this to your configuration:
