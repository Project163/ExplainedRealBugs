In certain situation API consumer might already know the exact list of file they want to lint and the globbing done by `eslint` could be skipped.\r\n\r\nThis is the case of [xojs/xo](https://github.com/xojs/xo) for example, where we [glob the files](https://github.com/xojs/xo/blob/652a6e51a8812e1d573c55159d8f55794e97b870/index.js#L92) to lint, based on predefined patterns and ignore. We have to determine the list of file to lint, rather than just passing glob patterns to `CLIEngine.executeOnFiles` in order to implement certain features specific to `xo`.\r\n\r\nAs a result the files are globbed twice, once by `xo`, then once by `eslint`. The globbing done by `eslint` is redundant in that case as the file paths to lint are already determined and the ones to ignore are already excluded.\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature would provide a way to call `CLIEngine.executeOnFiles` with a list of paths rather than a list of glob patterns. When called this way `eslint` would process the file paths passed, skipping the glob resolution. This would result in a performance increase for users of tools consuming the `eslint` API.\r\n\r\nI'm mentioning the case of `xo` as an example, but I believe it could be useful for other tools consuming the `CLIEngine.executeOnFiles` API.\r\n\r\nAs far as my test went, I think the change would be fairly simple, backward compatible and non obstructive for `eslint`.\r\n\r\n`CLIEngine.executeOnFiles` could accept a second parameter, `filePaths` and\r\n```js\r\nconst fileList = globUtil.listFilesToProcess(this.resolveFileGlobPatterns(patterns), options)\r\n```\r\nwould become something along those lines:\r\n```js\r\nconst fileList = (filePaths || []).map(filePath => ({filename: filePath, ignored: false})) .concat(globUtil.listFilesToProcess(this.resolveFileGlobPatterns(patterns), options));\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOr instead `CLIEngine.executeOnFiles` could accept either:\r\n- an `Array` in which case it would behave as of now\r\n- and Object with a `patterns` and a `filePaths` property in which case the `patterns` would be handled as of now, and the `filePaths` as proposed above\r\n\r\nIn my very rough tests done on a test project with large amount of files the performance gain in the case of `xo` is around a 20% reduction in running time.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9972/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
