// (A)\r\n})\r\n.catch(() => {}) // (B)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is this different from not catching any potential async errors in a non-`async` executor? It isn't -- but, the above example gives off a feeling like you're throwing a sync error, while it's not, and for people new to async/await this may not be evident.\r\n\r\nMore info in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43083793/927631).\r\n\r\nThus, I propose a rule that forbids `async` [*executor* function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[ ] Enforces code style\r\n[x] Warns about a potential error\r\n[ ] Suggests an alternate way of doing something\r\n[ ] Other (please specify:)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise( async function (resolve, reject) {\r\n    // any code\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise( async (resolve, reject) => {\r\n    // any code\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst executor = async function (resolve, reject) {\r\n    // any code\r\n};\r\nnew Promise( executor );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nIt seems like to become common-enough error when async/await becomes more mainstream to include it in core.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10217/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
