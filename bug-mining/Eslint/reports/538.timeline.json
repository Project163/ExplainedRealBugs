If so then [the docs for `--ignore-path`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/command-line-interface#--ignore-path) need to make this clear.\r\n\r\nThat's correct, `--ignore-path` and a few other CLI options are intentionally not supported when using `eslint.config.js`. I agree that it would be good to document this, but I'm not sure if it would be better to update the CLI docs or new config files docs. Since there are other features that are not supported when using `eslint.config.js`, such as automatically loading `.eslintignore` files and `/* env */` directives, it might be better to add a new section to [Configuration Files (New)](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files-new) listing all the unsupported features. @nzakas what do you think?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1281190240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7604277195,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5UJqDFzwAAAAHFQA_L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7604277195","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-17T17:13:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7604277200,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc5UJqDFzwAAAAHFQA_Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7604277200","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-17T17:13:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7604277216,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5UJqDFzwAAAAHFQA_g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7604277216","actor":{"login":"jedwards1211","id":1448194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDgxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1448194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211","html_url":"https://github.com/jedwards1211","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-17T17:13:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7604277224,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc5UJqDFzwAAAAHFQA_o","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/
