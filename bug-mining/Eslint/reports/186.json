We're [encountering](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/1974) [this](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/2095) [very](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/2108) [often](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/1881) after releases in eslint-plugin-react and frequently have to ask for reproduction code.\r\n\r\nI'm filing this to double-check if anything can be done in ESLint core to improve on this.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n It'd be ideal if before the stack trace we could output the source file name and line number that caused the crash, although I imagine at that point it wouldn't be too hard to output the actual code on that line. I'm not sure if this can be achieved within ESLint's architecture, which I'm not familiar with.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nYes, although again I'm not familiar with the ESLint codebase.","closed_by":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11304/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
