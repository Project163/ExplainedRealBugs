Environment\n\nNode version: v18.16.0\r\nnpm version: v9.5.1\r\nLocal ESLint version: v8.45.0 (Currently used)\r\nGlobal ESLint version: Not found\r\nOperating System: win32 10.0.23493\n\n### What parser are you using?\n\nDefault (Espree)\n\n### What did you do?\n\n<details>\r\n<summary>Configuration</summary>\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = [\r\n  {\r\n    rules: {\r\n      \"no-use-before-define\": [\"error\", { functions: false, classes: true }]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint no-use-before-define: warn */\r\n\r\nconst a = A();\r\nconst b = new B();\r\n\r\nfunction A() {}\r\nclass B {}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nGiven the documented behaviour for rule configuration overrides/merges is to retain options if only a severity is specified in an override/later merged config element, I'd expect the same to be true of comment directives.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, `no-use-before-define` generates only a single error highlighting the use of the class `B` if the comment directive is not present.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)\\someFile.js\r\n  4:15  error  'B' was used before it was defined  no-use-before-define\r\n\r\n✖ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd expect adding in the comment directive with only the severity specified to turn that error into a warning, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)\\someFile.js\r\n  4:15  warning  'B' was used before it was defined         no-use-before-define\r\n\r\n✖ 1 problems (0 errors, 1 warnings)\r\n```\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nAdding in the comment directive creates two warnings, because the default options of `no-use-before-define` have overridden my original configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)\\someFile.js\r\n  3:11  warning  'someFunc' was used before it was defined  no-use-before-define\r\n  4:15  warning  'B' was used before it was defined         no-use-before-define\r\n\r\n✖ 2 problems (0 errors, 2 warnings)\r\n```\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible

Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nI think this can be fixed by updating [linter.js#1325](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/7e9be4bd7331d0e8e8e0af0b075a2f6d28d1bea3/lib/linter/linter.js#L1325) and [linter.js#1625](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/7e9be4bd7331d0e8e8e0af0b075a2f6d28d1bea3/lib/linter/linter.js#L1625) to use the `flatConfigSchema.rules.merge` rather than `Object.assign`.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
