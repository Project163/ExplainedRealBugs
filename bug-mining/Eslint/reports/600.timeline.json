fully in favour of this! [We on typescript-eslint have been big proponents of this](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/troubleshooting/formatting) for a long time and we have the same policy as ESLint around formatting rules - no brand new rules; no new options. We also mostly leave them in the community-maintained domain (as in the maintainers don't normally action bug reports for them).\r\n\r\nWe've been in this weird state for a while because there's a few formatting rules in core that break on TS syntax - so we need to have extension rules in our project to support the syntax. Around half of our extension rules are formatting rules!\r\n\r\nSo I think that ESLint core taking a hard stance will be a boon for the community at large, and will help us simplify things immensely ourselves 🎉\r\n\r\nHowever I do know that a lot of people don't like formatters for various reasons. Whilst I clearly disagree with their reasons I think having the option out there is okay.\r\nSo I might suggest that all of the rules could be moved into the @eslint-community namespace as a separate plugin. This would allow the community to take control of them and maintain them (or let them languish as the community decides) and would also allow the support for other languages (eg the @typescript-eslint extension rule changes can be merged into such a fork).\r\n\r\nThis was actually something that @JoshuaKGoldberg and I had talked about in the past to try and \"get rid of\" formatting rules from @typescript-eslint given we never used them and were sick of the load from bug reports and PR reviews around them.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1705882835/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradzacher","id":7462525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjI1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7462525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher","html_url":"https://github.com/bradzacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10278340985,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5v0uitzwAAAAJkowl5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10278340985","actor":{"login":"typescript-eslint","id":46634674,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2NjM0Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46634674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint","html_url":"https://github.com/typescript-eslint","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-05T03:05:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10278340990,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5v0uitzwAAAAJkowl-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10278340990","actor":{"login":"eslint-community","id":94557945,"node_id":"O_kgDOBaLW-Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94557945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint-community","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-community/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-05T03:05:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10278346615,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5v0uitzwAAAAJkox93","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10278346615","actor":{"login":"JoshuaKGoldberg","id":3335181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzUxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3335181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/received_events","type

This would allow the community to take control of them and maintain them (or let them languish as the community decides) and would also allow the support for other languages (eg the https://github.com/typescript-eslint extension rule changes can be merged into such a fork).\r\n\r\nIn the short-term, the rules won't be removed from the core, we just won't keep updating them. In the long term, repackaging them into a separate plugin makes sense. My overall goal is to not move these over during the rewrite, so the final ruleset after the rewrite doesn't contain any formatting rules.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1708539547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1708752297","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17522#issuecomment-1708752297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17522","id":1708752297,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5l2X2p","user":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-06T16:45:41Z","updated_at":"2023-09-06T16:45:41Z","body":"I generally support this proposal, we just need to define a concrete list of rules we'd like to deprecate.\r\n\r\n> I'd like to deprecate all formatting rules (anything that is adjusting whitespace) in v9 and recommend that people use a source code formatter instead.\r\n\r\nWould we keep non-whitespace rules that might classify as \"formatting\"?
