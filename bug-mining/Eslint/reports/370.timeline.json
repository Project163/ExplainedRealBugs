have concerns about cases such as the following, which would be reported if this rule uses `ReferenceTracker`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar x = something ? MyClass : Object;\r\n\r\nvar y = new x();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, user can't just replace something with `{}`. The code has to be refactored to avoid warning. There could be a more complex example that makes sense but wouldn't satisfy the new version of this rule.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering is `ReferenceTracker` suitable for some rules that are already using it, because it tracks all *potential* references to the targeted global.\r\n\r\nIt seems useful in `no-obj-calls` as it can warn about possible calls to `Math`, `JSON` and other non-callable globals in some code paths, which is indeed a runtime error.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this looks like a false positive in the `prefer-object-spread` rule and an autofix that changes the behavior:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint prefer-object-spread: [\"error\"] */\r\n\r\nvar doSomething = foo ? myFunc : Object.assign;\r\n\r\nvar x = doSomething({}, a, b); // gets fixed to: var x = { ...a,
