for the info! I thought the timeouts might have been caused by copying relatively large fixture directories in some `before` hooks (we already increased timeouts for some of them in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13768), but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\r\n\r\n> Increase the timeout from 10s to 60s will solve.\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/355b23d0c4e050be4e53292f552a47c10ec6e00e/Makefile.js#L81-L82\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's a good idea to increase the timeout in all environments where we run tests, as that could hide performance issues we might have in the code.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could read this value from an environment variable (e.g., `ESLINT_MOCHA_TIMEOUT`) and use the default 10000 only if the variable was not set.
