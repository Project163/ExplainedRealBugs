expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI'd expect that `--no-ignore` affects only global ignores, and thus the config object with `ignores` and other keys is not applied to files that match its `ignores`, so there should be no lint errors.\r\n\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1:1  error  'foo' is not defined  no-undef\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible
