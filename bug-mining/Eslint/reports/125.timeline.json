(put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] New rule: fixes #10049, closes #10620.\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\n- Add a new rule `no-dismantled-character-class` rule.\r\n- Add utilities for Unicode (`lib/util/unicode/*`).\r\n- Add a script `tools/update-unicode-utils.js` to generate the utility. This generates `isCombiningCharacter` function from https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt . It will be useful to update the function for the future Unicode versions.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n- Please correct documentation.\r\n- Are there other patterns of multi-code-point characters?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1759220027,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc1OTIyMDAyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1759220027","actor":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-30T03:24:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1759220068,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NTkyMjAwNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1759220068","actor":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2cc32405719b10083974022b1397963dc6e580fb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/2cc32405719b10083974022b1397963dc6e580fb","created_at":"2018-07-30T03:24:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2099459036,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjA5OTQ1OTAzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2099459036","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-27T18:53:18Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2099459046,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIwOTk0NTkwNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2099459046","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-depreca
