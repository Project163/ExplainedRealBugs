you meant '-c'?`\r\n\r\n\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\n\nhttps://github.com/jedahan/c.git\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nI have an .eslintrc.js in one folder, but because a parent folder has an eslint.config.js, this error throws.\r\n\r\nIt is really surprising to me that eslint recurses up directories, especially ones beyond version control.\r\n\r\nIts extra surprising that it does so *even with a valid config in the current directory*\r\n\r\nIts only slightly surprising that the same binary operates in two different modes depending on what config it found.","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
