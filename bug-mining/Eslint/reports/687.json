This is confusing because to make this work I have to know the name the plugin decided to use for its rules, but extends does not have this restrictions.\n\nFor more information and examples, see the [relevant part of RFC126](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/bd9dc57de306e596a6d680e4a199afdd9659ed32/designs/2024-config-extends/README.md#reassignable-plugin-configs).\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nIn eslint/rfcs#126 it was proposed to solve this by adding a new `meta.namespace` key to `Plugin` and have `defineConfig` rewrite the key used to reference a rule in the extended configurations. At least that is how I understood the solution, for more details, see the RFC text.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nSince the RFC is merged, I assume the decision on this was already made? I am mainly opening this issue, because I just ran into this, remembered some talk about it in the RFC, but did not find an issue I could subscribe to for updates. I searched the issue tracker for this, but the only thing I found was #19116, which is already closed.","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19655/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
