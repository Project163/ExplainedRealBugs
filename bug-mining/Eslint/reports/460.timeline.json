(or maybe I am missing.)\r\n\r\nthoughts? \r\notherwise I think `bug` label can be removed then ?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/633090025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anikethsaha","id":26347874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzQ3ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26347874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha","html_url":"https://github.com/anikethsaha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anikethsaha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/633159881","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13349#issuecomment-633159881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13349","id":633159881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzE1OTg4MQ==","user":{"login":"brettz9","id":20234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9","html_url":"https://github.com/brettz9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-24T00:40:35Z","updated_at":"2020-05-24T00:41:14Z","body":"Re: it not mentioning `meta`, yeah, the [Working with Rules](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules) page doesn't mention that `meta` can be omitted.\r\n\r\nAs far as whether it should be a breaking change to require `meta.fixable` always, I'd personally even be in favor of always requiring `meta` (specifically so as to require `meta.type` even for non-fixable rules--though that is not required now and would perhaps also need an \"other\" type; without getting too off track, in my eslint [badge-maker](https://github.com/brettz9/eslint-formatter-badger), I felt the need to let users override the built-in `type`'s as they are not very specific (e.g., as to whether the \"problem\" is for security, preventing obtrusiveness, etc); I could perhaps use `docs.category` for that instead, but these are not enumerated in the docs nor encouraged for third-party use).\r\n\r\nHowever, I have come across quite a number of plugins using the legacy format or not using `meta` if they are, so I would expect people might worry about breaking too many old plugins.

I've encountered have thankfully been open to updates, e.g., recently with https://github.com/SonarSource/eslint-plugin-sonarjs/pull/161 . (In the cases where the lack of `meta.fixable` is due to using the old format where there is just a function exported and no `create` as well as no `meta` (i.e., when the old format is in use), authors might see this less as \"buggy\" and more as merely \"deprecated\" since those rules predated `meta` entirely, but I get your gist, esp. with the docs urging this now.)\r\n\r\nI am waiting on one PR, https://github.com/Turbo87/eslint-plugin-chai-expect/pull/99 , to introduce the new rule format, so I know at least one plugins still using the old format, but in this case, the rules do not happen to be fixable.\r\n\r\nIf you were only going to fix the case of requiring `meta.fixable` when `create` was present, I would think you might avoid a major bump (assuming the docs when the [new rule format](https://eslint.org/blog/2016/07/eslint-new-rule-format) was introduced had from the beginning added mention of this need).\r\n\r\nHowever, I would think no. 1 on your list is not an option for a major bump when the fixing occurs with the deprecated rule format since that format (which did not even allow `meta` at all despite supporting fixing) is still mentioned as supported (though deprecated) at https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules (beginning of page).\r\n\r\nWhile I haven't done any exhaustive study (e.g., of https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint/ or those on npm), I would think therefore that with no. 1 excluded, no. 2 could be chosen over no. 3 as:\r\n\r\n1. At least the big ones I have used or needed to use with other projects, \"standard\", \"prettier\", \"promise\", \"import\", \"jsdoc\", \"sonarjs\" and other ones of interest to me (e.g., \"mocha\", \"mocha-cleanup\", various chai ones) are pretty much all on board already.\r\n2. It's not too big of a hassle to just add a `create` method and if needed add a `fixable`.\r\n3. The blog post introducing the new rule format (at https://eslint.org/blog/2016/07/eslint-new-rule-format ) mentions \"knowing that a rule is fixable ahead of time allows us to optimize the autofixing process as well as call this out in documentation\" so it should be nice to be able to enforce this benefit (even if there may be some plugins or custom rules in the wild that have yet to make the change).\r\n\r\nIMO, it would be nice to also require `meta.type` (and `meta.docs` (`url` and/or `description`) too if the latter were worded less as being ESLint-project-specific). Even for non-fixable rules, a `type` can be used by formatters, so that tools could more readily make use of them. Authors I have encountered have been open to adding the former or have at least not objected for the few PRs I have still waiting merging (I haven't made PRs for `docs`). Don't want to distract with this suggestion, but just mentioning if a breaking change is being made anyways and there were interest.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/645775807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brettz9","id":20234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9","html_url":"https://github.com/brettz9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettz9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/646729029","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13349#issuecomment-646729029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13349","id":646729029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NjcyOTAyOQ==","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-19T16:23:56Z","updated_at":"2020-06-19T16:23:56Z","body":"Because we don't guarantee fixes to be applied, I think we can fix this behavior to work as it was originally intended. The result of using a rule with a legacy fixer is that it will only warn and not fix, which I wouldn't consider a breaking change.\r\n\r\nThe bigger question is why `RuleTester` isn't testing for this already. That's one of our primary ways of enforcing rule standards and I'm surprised there's not a check in there.\r\n\r\nHere's what I would suggest as a path forward:\r\n\r\n1. Make an announcement about this explaining that it is a bug and we know it will affect people.\r\n2. Update `RuleTester` to check that `meta.fixable` is present whenever a fix is provided.
