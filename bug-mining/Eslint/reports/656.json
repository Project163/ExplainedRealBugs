This package is very popular (12M downloads per week), but it's always out of date because we don't maintain it. This continues to cause issues as we work on language plugins and the core rewrite.\r\n\r\nFurther, it can take weeks to get changes to `@types/eslint` approved([last PR](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/69957)) and deployed. Because we'll likely have more type changes as we accelerate language plugins and core rewrite work, this just doesn't seem sustainable.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nESLint should publish its own types.\r\n\r\nI think the easiest place to start is just to copy the type definitions from `@types/eslint` as-is and publish those as part of the `eslint` package. This will be provide a good level of compatibility for those using `@types/eslint`.\r\n\r\nWe can then easily make modifications, including references to `@eslint/core` as we go forward.\r\n\r\nIn terms of types from `eslint` and `@eslint/core`:\r\n\r\n* `@eslint/core` types will be exclusively those types that are for use in the core rewrite. This excludes API interfaces such as `ESLint` and `Linter`.\r\n* `eslint` types will be a superset of `@eslint/core` that includes API interfaces for the `eslint` package.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18845/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
