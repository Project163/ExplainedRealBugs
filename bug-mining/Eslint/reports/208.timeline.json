   ESLint adheres to the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Bug fixes #11194, fixes #11687\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I'm sorry that this change is huge.\r\n\r\nI have improved the rule's logic with using information that `eslint-scope` made. The new logic is the following steps (roughly):\r\n\r\n1. Create `Identifier` → `Reference` map when ESLint entered each async/generator function.\r\n1. In an async/generator function,\r\n    1. initialize each code path segment having two information: outdated read variables and fresh read variables. Segments inherit that information from the previous segments.\r\n    1. On `Identifier` nodes, find the reference of the node by the map (of step 1). Then:\r\n        - If `reference.isRead()` is true, add it to the fresh read variable list of the current code path segment.\r\n        - If `reference.isWrite()` is true, store the `reference.writeExpr` (this is `AssignmentExpression#right` if it's assignment) to verify it later.\r\n    1. On `AwaitExpression`/`YieldExpression` nodes (exit), move the fresh read variables to the outdated read variables, on the current code path segment.\r\n    1. On expression nodes (exit), if it's a stored `reference.writeExpr`, do the verification. If the variable that the reference refers is outdated on the current code path, report it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this logic does the verification on the main traversal instead of extra traversal.\r\n\r\nThe important part for #11194 bug fix is the step 1. The rule ignores `Identifier` node if it's not a reference.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2207985017,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwNzk4NTAxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2207985017","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-16T04:14:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2207985027,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyMDc5ODUwMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2207985027","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-16T04:14:53Z","label":{"name":"auto
