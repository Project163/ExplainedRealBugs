A class created with pattern behaves very differently from a normal class in the OOP paradigm, for example, in that every new instance should be a separate object. There seemed to be no practical usage of this pattern. Forbidding this pattern prevents mistake resulting from unfamiliarity with the language or copy-paste error.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nPossibly.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12481/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
