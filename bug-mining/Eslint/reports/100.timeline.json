a few notes/questions:\r\n\r\nContext appreciated.....\r\n\r\nLooks like we can use https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rules/no-warning-comments.js#L114 and inspect the node for the first and last chars of the comment.\r\n\r\nThen if the last and first element of the string are eql to `*`, then remove them and pass the new substring to https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rules/no-warning-comments.js#L119. \r\n\r\nThe regex on line https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rules/no-warning-comments.js#L80 needs to also be updated for any content thats location is `start` and has an`*`.  So, https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rules/no-warning-comments.js#L80 should be changed to `prefix = \"^\\\\s*.*\";`.\r\n\r\nThough this solution fixes the example above, it doesnt account for if a user were too:\r\n```\r\n/***\r\n * todo\r\n ***/\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow many `*` should we allow the user to have? \r\n\r\nAlso the implementation described above fixes this example(though you should use `//` for inline quotes):\r\n\r\n```\r\n/** todo **/\r\n```\r\n\r\n@platinumazure @mysticatea what are your thoughts on this approach?\r\n\r\nI could also see how we could update the `ast-utils`  it would just have a higher touch rate and we would need to modify more widely used code.   I could see doing that if we were to rethink how we check for JDOC comments and establish some conditions around that.\r\n\r\nThank
