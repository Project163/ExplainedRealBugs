ESLint version\r\n\r\n`main`\r\n\r\n### What problem do you want to solve?\r\n\r\nSince the last major release, there have been many changes in ESLint projects. Notably, built-in configurations have been extracted into a separate package `@eslint/js`, we have a new eslint.org site with underlying docs sites for different versions, some projects are using release-please, and we switched to conventional commits.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem that all parts of our infrastructure support prereleases.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n\r\n* Jenkins\r\n  * The job for `@eslint/js` doesn't provide a way to choose a prerelease type and publish the package with the `next` tag.\r\n* release-please\r\n  * We'll have a breaking change in `@eslint/eslintrc` (https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/pull/139). Do we want to publish a v3 prerelease first? I think it's fine to just publish regular v3.0.0 right away, but if we want prereleases we'll need to figure out how to publish preleases with release-please.\r\n* Conventional commits\r\n  * It [doesn't seem](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-release/blob/c55858f6de1d2d6c7b58a1817b3af5ea59e65fc8/lib/release-ops.js#L30-L46) that eslint-release supports `docs!` tags, so we'll need to either update eslint-release or merge those commits as just `docs`.\r\n* eslint.org site\r\n  * On the homepage, the \"Latest Version\" should probably stay at v8.56.0, and we might want to also show the latest prerelease version (the version that is `next` on npm).\r\n* docs sites\r\n   * We should create `next` branch, set up Netlify, and update [redirects](https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/blob/main/src/static/redirects.njk) for `/docs/next/`\r\n   * Ideally, all three docs sites (head, next, latest) should have the following list in version selectors: HEAD, NEXT, v8.56.0. Most of the work for this was already done in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/commit/66694136b67277c050bd27f60050779687a88c9f, but we'll probably also need to manually update the `latest` branch, and I'm not sure if v9.0.0-alpha.0 will mistakenly appear instead of v8.56.0 on HEAD and NEXT docs sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\nUpdate the infrastructure for prereleases according to the points above.\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nIs there anything else that should be updated?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17893/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14872421624,"node_id":"ATPVTE_lADOAKjKDc569DrhzwAAAAN2dyT4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/14872421624","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project_v2","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-08T21:21:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15085517105,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAKjKDc569DrhzwAAAAODKrkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/15085517105","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-08T21:21:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11881331920,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAKjKDc569DrhzwAAAALELrzQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/11881331920","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-21T19:45:07Z","label":{"name":"needs

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nEnsured that the version number is displayed instead of NEXT in the dropdown on the docs site.

I don't think it matters much but seemed better to use `next` to properly indicate the intent.\r\n\r\n**Note:** We'll need to make the same change in the `v8.x` branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--
