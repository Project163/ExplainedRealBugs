ESLint version\r\n\r\n8.56.0\r\n\r\n### What problem do you want to solve?\r\n\r\nESLint configs have traditionally been exported by ESLint plugins under a standard `configs` object (alongside the `rules` object). This has allowed tooling like [eslint-doc-generator](https://github.com/bmish/eslint-doc-generator) and [lintbase.com](https://www.lintbase.com/) to automatically detect/analyze configs and generate documentation regarding them including the list of configs, which rules belong to which configs, etc.\r\n\r\nNew [flat configs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new) can be exported in a variety of ways, including as an arbitrary file export from the plugin, such as `require('eslint-plugin-ember/configs/recommended')` in this [example](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/pull/2020) I worked on, and not necessarily in the `configs` object exported by the plugin.\r\n\r\nFor existing plugins that want to support both legacy and flat versions of their configs while maintaining backwards-compatability, I've typically seen them leave the `configs` object for legacy configs, and add file exports for the new flat configs.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge, since there aren't strict requirements around how or where flat configs are exported from, the user has to manually look up in the plugin's README to find out what the configs are and how exactly to import and use them (including whether they are arrays or objects). As you can imagine, depending on the README to discover configs is not conducive to automated tooling.\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\n**Note:** See updated proposal in: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18095#issuecomment-1951414598\r\n\r\nCould there be a convention or requirement for how plugins should export flat configs? Presumably, this would keep legacy config exporting the same through the `configs` object for backwards-compatability so plugins can support both config types, at least for some time.\r\n\r\nOne idea is to require or suggest plugins to export a new `configurations` object containing a mapping of config name to each loaded flat config.\r\n\r\nAnd what about recommendations around the direct file path entrypoint for exporting flat configs? I've seen plugins using `eslint-plugin-example/configs/config-name` or variations of this. Perhaps we could at least recommend a path format.\r\n\r\nIdeally, any convention or requirement would enable programmatic discoverability of flat configs, with the added benefit of simply making it easier to use flat configs.\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n*

about keeping all (legacy and flat) configs in the `plugin.configs` but when resolving the string specifier `S`:\nCheck whether `plugin.configs.S` is a flat config.\nIf it is a flat config, use it.\nOtherwise try resolving with a known prefix (e.g. `flat/`), so `plugin.configs.flat/S`.\nIf it is a flat config, use it and otherwise throw an error that `S` is not resolvable.\n\nSo for example given:\n```json\n{\n\t\"configs\": {\n\t\t\"recommended\": { \"extends\": [] },\n\t\t\"flat/recommended\": { \"plugin\": {}, \"rules\": {} }\t\n\t}\n}\n```\nIt first checks `recommended`, sees it is not a flat config, then checks `flat-recommended` and finds a compatible config.\nThis is how some eslint plugins are already organized (e.g. `typescript-eslint` or
