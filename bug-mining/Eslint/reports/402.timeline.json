bug\r\n\r\nI just upgrade `react-scripts` to 3.3.0. I am able to use nullish coalescing, but when I attempt to use optional chaining, I can't compile as I get this error: \r\n```\r\n./src/components/Select/Select.tsx\r\n  Line 141:5:  Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression  no-unused-expressions\r\n\r\nSearch for the keywords to learn more about each error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line in question is:\r\n```ts\r\n    this.props.onChange?.(resultingValue);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nNo, I don't have time at the moment. If this might help I'll try it.\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nI searched for optional chaining, no-unused-expressions, eslint optional chaining.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n```\r\nnpx: installed 91 in 30.467s\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.17134\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 12.2.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    Yarn: Not Found\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: 42.17134.1098.0\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.17134.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.12.0 => 16.12.0\r\n    react-dom: ^16.12.0 => 16.12.0\r\n    react-scripts: 3.3.0 => 3.3.0\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use optional chaining.\r\n2. Attempt to run `npm start`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expected the app to compile and for the code to function like:\r\n```\r\n    this.props.onChange !== undefined && this.props.onChange(resultingValue);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe app failed to compile and gave the above message.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8107/reactions","total_count":107,"+1":106,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jrieken","id":1794099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"created_at":"2020-01-03T08:43:57Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T08:43:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/87644","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/87644/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/87644/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/87644/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/87644","id":542110828,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzU2NjE5ODY3","number":87644,"title":"tslint
