If you are proposing a new rule, please continue on. If you are here for another reason, please see below:\r\n\r\n    1. To report a bug: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/reporting-bugs\r\n    2. To request a rule change: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/rule-changes\r\n    3. To request a change that is not a bug fix, rule change, or new rule: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/changes\r\n    4. If you have any questions, please stop by our chatroom: https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint\r\n\r\n    Note that leaving sections blank will make it difficult for us to troubleshoot and we may have to close the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Please describe what the rule should do:**\r\n\r\nSuggests to use regex literals instead of `RegExp()`/`new RegExp()` when these calls have:\r\n\r\n* One argument that is a string literal.\r\n* Two arguments and they are both string literals.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Suggests an alternate way of doing something (suggestion)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n// good, dynamic\r\nnew RegExp(pattern);\r\nnew RegExp(prefix + \"foo\");\r\nnew RegExp(\"foo\", flags);\r\n\r\n// good, regex literals\r\n/^\\d\\./\r\n/\\d\\d\\.\\d\\d\\.\\d\\d\\d\\d/\r\n\r\n// bad, this is a very possible error\r\nnew RegExp(\"^\\d\\.\");\r\nnew RegExp(\"\\d\\d\\.\\d\\d\\.\\d\\d\\d\\d\");\r\n\r\n// bad, correct but unreadable\r\nnew RegExp(\"^\\\\d\\\\.\");\r\nnew RegExp(\"\\\\d\\\\d\\\\.\\\\d\\\\d\\\\.\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nI think this is not just a style preference, rather a good practice to avoid an unnecessary level of the string literal syntax on top of the regex syntax. It's error-prone and difficult to reason about escapes of escapes.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12238/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
