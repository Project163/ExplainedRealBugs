But the thing is that I recently have been struggling a bit to figure out how rules with options given as **object** are resulting from a base config. The question raised about a deriving rule was:\r\n\r\n> Does it override only the given props in the options object or does it replace the whole object having not given props resolving to their defaults?\r\n\r\nSure it does the latter but that's not clear to the reader.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion here is to add another example of overriding a rule which has options given as an object instead of just a single string value just to make it crystal clear about how the mechanism works.\r\n\r\nThe suggested documentation is expected to become like so:\r\n\r\n```mk\r\nThe `rules` property can do any of the following to extend (or override) the set of rules:\r\n\r\n...\r\n* override options for rules from base configurations:\r\n    ...\r\n* override options for rules given as object from base configurations:\r\n    * Base config: `'max-lines': ['error', { max: 200, skipBlankLines: true, skipComments: true }]`\r\n    * Derived config: `'max-lines': ['error', { max: 100 }]`\r\n    * Resulting actual config: `'max-lines': ['error', { max: 100 }]` where `skipBlankLines` and `skipComments` default to `false`\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes, sure!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
