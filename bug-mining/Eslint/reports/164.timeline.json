The following line (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js#L112): \r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn (isLeftConstant && isRightConstant) || isLeftShortCircuit || isRightShortCircuit;\r\n```\r\n\r\n...doesn't look correct to me. If I've understood the rule correctly, then any constant in a conditional should be marked as an error, so I updated it to this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn isLeftConstant || isRightConstant || isLeftShortCircuit || isRightShortCircuit;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes my newly added tests to pass, but also causes some existing tests to fail. However I'm not entirely sure these tests are correct. The following are all marked as **valid** examples, yet all of them contain a constant:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"if (void a || a);\",\r\n\"if (a || void a);\",\r\n\"if(false || abc==='str'){}\",\r\n\"if(true && abc==='str'){}\",\r\n\"if(typeof 'str' && abc==='str'){}\",\r\n\"if(abc==='str' || false || def ==='str'){}\",\r\n\"if(true && abc==='str' || def ==='str'){}\",\r\n\"if(true && typeof abc==='string'){}\",\r\n\"if(a === 'str' && typeof b){}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you agree these tests are incorrect I'll be happy to change them to be incorrect examples and raise a PR. If not, then some clarification around the intention of this rule would be useful.
