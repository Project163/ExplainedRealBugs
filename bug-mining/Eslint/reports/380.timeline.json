Thanks for being willing to work on this. Please note that this proposal hasn't been accepted yet, and we generally recommend that you wait until an issue has been accepted before implementing (to avoid throwaway work).\r\n\r\nRegarding handling comments, ESLint doesn't use `(leading|trailing)Comments` any more (this behavior was [dropped in v4](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-4.0.0#ast-nodes-no-longer-have-comment-properties). ESLint now handles comments in the context of tokens, rather than the AST. In addition to the AST, Espree also returns a top-level `tokens` and `comments` key, and ESLint uses these arrays to create a token store that powers the the token-iteration APIs. Please check out the docs [here](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#accessing-comments) on more information for handling
