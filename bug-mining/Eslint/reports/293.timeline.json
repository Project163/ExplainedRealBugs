Single statement `function` declarations (e.g. `if (true) function foo () {}`) should not be reported.\r\n3. A small refactoring to avoid three-state boolean logic for `expected`, as it wasn't used as described in the comment (e.g. `consistent` code was overriding explicitly set `false`), and I guess it was a bit confusing.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nThe refactoring.\r\n\r\nTest cases with the `consistent`
