Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\nI have runned an autofix in a legacy code with more than 10k files. When it finds a variable that should be a constant (because it is not reasigned) and is initialized as ```undefined``` it fix the code transforming it to ```const foo;``` causing errors over the code. I tried to change the rules order to first turns it to a constant and them check the undefined init so it should be fixed (as per: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-undef-init). But is still happening.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\r\nYes, need some guidance but I can do this :) \r\n\r\n![eslint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15704333/100765799-a89fe080-33d6-11eb-8aae-160e28610e24.gif)","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13899/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13899/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
