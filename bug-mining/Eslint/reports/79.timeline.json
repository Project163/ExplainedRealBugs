is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Bug fix\r\n\r\n- Fixes #10246\r\n- Fixes #10247\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the extra check in `getScope()` function. As a result, `context.getScope()` gets a better behavior on some AST nodes.\r\n\r\n- `context.getScope()` returns `for` scope on `ForStatement`, `ForInStatement`, and `ForOfStatement` in `>=ES2015`.\r\n  - Currently it returns the parent scope of the correct scope. This means that it returns the parent `for` scope if `for` loop is nested. It was confusing.\r\n- `context.getScope()` returns `catch` scope on `CatchClause` in `ES5`.\r\n  - Currently it returns the parent scope of the correct scope. \r\n- `context.getScope()` returns `with` scope on `WithStatement` in `>=ES5`.\r\n  - Currently it returns the parent scope of the correct scope. \r\n\r\n`context.getScope()` is still depending on `parserOptions.ecmaVersion` and `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures.globalReturn` because the `eslint-scope` package changes that behavior by those options. However, probably it's no problem since custom parsers can have own scope analysis.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nI think that this is a breaking change since it changes the behavior of the long-living `context.getScope()` method. But, at least, I  didn't need to fix the tests of core rules in this PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1596253793,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1OTYyNTM3OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1596253793","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-26T11:26:06Z","label":{"name":"tsc agenda","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/384606839","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10246#issuecomment-384606839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10246","id":384606839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDYwNjgzOQ==","user":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-26T11:30:25Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T11:30:25Z","body":"**TSC Summary**: `context.getScope()` on any of `ForStatement`, `ForInStatement`, and `ForOfStatement` should return these `for` scope.
