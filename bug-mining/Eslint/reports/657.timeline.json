rationale for adopting modified cyclomatic complexity vs the classic one is that switch statements are often appropriate constructs for patterns such as action matching (think redux), route matching, message matching, and code maintainers may not want to move away from them.

If a switch statement is used without break statements, cases will fall through to the next case. For example:\n\n```\nfunction a(x) {\n    switch (x) {\n        case 1:\n            // no break\n        case 2:\n            // no break\n        case 3:\n            // no break\n        default:\n            4;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this case, if x is 1, it will fall through all cases and eventually execute the default case.

But Modified Complexity is a pretty common metric that a number of other code analysis tools implement consistently (I provided the references in the description), so I would consider it \"standard\" at this point.
