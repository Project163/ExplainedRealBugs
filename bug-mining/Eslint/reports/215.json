I can point out three issues:\r\n\r\n* The documentation only suggests using `getPrototypeOf` method instead of `__proto__`. But `getPrototypeOf` cannot change the prototype of an object, and as such cannot be used to rewrite assignments to the `__proto__` property, which the `no-proto` rule complains about.\r\n* The documentation says that \"support for `getPrototypeOf` is not yet universal\". Now `getPrototypeOf` (unlike `setPrototypeOf`) is part of ES 5.1 spec and is implemented in browsers as old as IE 9 and Safari 7.\r\n* There are two choices for `getPrototypeOf`: `Object.get​PrototypeOf` and `Reflect​.getPrototypeOf`, where the main difference is browser support. The documentation leaves this ambiguity open to the reader.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to submit a PR if the team agrees that the rule documentation needs to be updated.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nSure.","closed_by":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11743/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
