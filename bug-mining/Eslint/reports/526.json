To construct the object you need to overwrite the prototype's constructor property. Due to the object-shorthand rule and auto-fixing of lint issues this is always turned in to a method which leads to a javascript error as constructor functions can't be methods.  So the rule should not only ignore uppercase functions names but also the lowercase constructor property when the option ignoreConstructors is set.  \r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Configuration</summary>\r\n\r\n``` \r\n{ \r\n...\r\n\"object-shorthand\": [\"error\", \"always\", { \"ignoreConstructors\": true }],\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/base/Object\"], (SapObject) => {\r\n    \"use strict\";\r\n\r\n    return SapObject.extend(\"ui5.extendedObject\", {\r\n        constructor() {},\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nsap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/base/Object\"], (SapObject) => {\r\n    \"use strict\";\r\n\r\n    return SapObject.extend(\"ui5.extendedObject\", {\r\n        constructor: function() {},\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n\r\nerror  Expected method shorthand                      object-shorthand\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
