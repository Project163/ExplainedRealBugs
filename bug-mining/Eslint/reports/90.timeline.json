The fixer checks if the previous token is actually a semicolon, and if not it just inserts the comma after the previous token instead of replacing it. Should be easy to understand from the edits.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\nBased on the existing tests and my understanding of fixer functions, I only
