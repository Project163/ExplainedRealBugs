Will they also set up `parserOptions` or just `globals`?\r\n\r\nThere was also the problem with the precedence arised in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/8291\r\n\r\nIf we deprecated `env` I assume it would be a soft deprecation, right? Otherwise it would create a lot of hassle.\r\n\r\nIf we want to move away from the `es6` behavior regarding `parserOptions`, another possible option would be to add `es2015`, `es2016`, ... make these only set globals, and \"deprecate\" `es6`.
