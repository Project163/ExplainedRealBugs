so `'latest'` itself is not the problem. The problem is that `comma-dangle` and a few other core rules are using `context.parserOptions.ecmaVersion`, which isn't set in the flat config mode.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions are:\r\n\r\n1. Update rules to use `context.languageOptions.ecmaVersion` instead.\r\n2. Update `Linter` to set `context.parserOptions.ecmaVersion` (based on `context.languageOptions.ecmaVersion`).\r\n\r\nI think we should do `1.` even if we later decide to implement `2.` for backward compatibility, so updating rules seems like the right fix for this problem.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1285931945/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7633952825,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc5UZD-KzwAAAAHHBOA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7633952825","actor":{"login":"nmschulte-aviture","id":5199745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTk3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5199745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture","html_url":"https://github.com/nmschulte-aviture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"921da3353fd8a42dc79cb4bb3be51835a5a3ef81","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nmschulte-aviture/eslint/commits/921da3353fd8a42dc79cb4bb3be51835a5a3ef81","created_at":"2022-10-20T18:37:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7633962938,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc5UZD-KzwAAAAHHBQe6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7633962938","actor":{"login":"nmschulte-aviture","id":5199745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTk3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5199745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture","html_url":"https://github.com/nmschulte-aviture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"97015adab93e84400d8dd5a76926b3cc65bc7cc1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nmschulte-aviture/eslint/commits/97015adab93e84400d8dd5a76926b3cc65bc7cc1","created_at":"2022-10-20T18:39:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nmschulte-aviture","id":5199745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTk3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5199745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture","html_url":"https://github.com/nmschulte-aviture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-aviture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmschulte-avitu
