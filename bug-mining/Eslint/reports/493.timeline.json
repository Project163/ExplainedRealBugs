would be a useful enhancement.\r\n\r\n@Yash-Singh1 any ideas on how this could be implemented?\r\n\r\nWe generally suggest that contributors wait for the issue to be accepted before working on it, but in this case I think it would be good to evaluate this enhancement on a prototype of the solution.\r\n\r\nThis is a nontrivial code transformation that should be aware of all differences between the syntax of [regular expression literals](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-literals-regular-expression-literals) and the syntax of [RegExp constructor input patterns](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-patterns).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew RegExp(\"\\n\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a valid RegExp input pattern consisting of a single code point for `\\n`, but in regular expression literals it would be invalid:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/\r\n/\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of the possible solutions is to use the built-in [RegExp.prototype.toString](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-regexp.prototype.tostring). By the specification, it should be safe:\r\n\r\n> The returned String has the form of a RegularExpressionLiteral that evaluates to another RegExp object with the same behaviour as this object.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[...new RegExp(\"\\n\").toString()]; // ['/', '\\', 'n', '/']\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome downsides of this solution would be:\r\n\r\n* It depends on the execution environment -  if the environment doesn't support syntax used in the given regular expression, we can't transform.\r\n* It doesn't preserve syntactic choices from the original string literal:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[...new RegExp(\"\\t\").toString()]; // ['/', '\\t', '/'] - this would be /    / in the source code, valid but unusual\r\n\r\n[...new RegExp(\"\\u1234\").toString()]; // ['/', 'ሴ', '/']\r\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/915195591/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5271983320,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc466W0pzwAAAAE6PBTY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/5271983320","actor":{"login":"Yash-Singh1","id":53054099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53054099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1","html_url":"https://github.com/Yash-Singh1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-08T12:28:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5271983325,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc466W0pzwAAAAE6PBTd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/5271983325","actor":{"login":"Yash-Singh1","id":53054099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53054099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1","html_url":"https://github.com/Yash-Singh1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-08T12:28:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/915524929","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15029#issuecomment-915524929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15029","id":915524929,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc42kc1B","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-08T19:52:37Z","updated_at":"2021-

We should only fix valid regular expressions.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/916797886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/917685400","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15029#issuecomment-917685400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15029","id":917685400,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc42ssSY","user":{"login":"Yash-Singh1","id":53054099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDU0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53054099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1","html_url":"https://github.com/Yash-Singh1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yash-Singh1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-12T18:22:04Z","updated_at":"2021-09-12T18:22:04Z","body":"Should `RegExp(1)` autofix to `/1/`?

I'm not too concerned about the part where we are inserting `/foo/` in the place of `RegExp(\"foo\")` in the source code.
