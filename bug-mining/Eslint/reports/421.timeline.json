But, they were not not explicitly disallowed language extensions, and all engines used to allow `\"\\8\"` and `\"\\9\"`, treating them as just `\"8\"` and `\"9\"` (i.e., as useless escapes).\r\n\r\nNow, as of tc39/ecma262#2054, they are defined in Annex B as _NonOctalDecimalEscapeSequence_:\r\n\r\n> NonOctalDecimalEscapeSequence :: one of\r\n> 89\r\n\r\nand thus required in browsers, but only in non-strict mode. They are now explicitly disallowed in strict mode.\r\n\r\nAlthough only recently added to the spec, the spec treats them as a legacy feature and in the same context as _LegacyOctalEscapeSequence_, so I think they should be reported by `no-octal-escape`.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n* `no-octal-escape` or `no-useless-escape`? I think `no-octal-escape`, but there are arguments for `no-useless-escape`, too.\r\n* Can we make this change in a minor version?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3968604605,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50Mzk2ODYwNDYwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3968604605","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-06T19:23:57Z","label":{"name":"evaluating","color":"fef2c0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3968604606,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM5Njg2MDQ2MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3968604606","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-06T19:23:57Z","label":{"name":"accepted","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/723256857","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13765#issuecomment-723256857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13765","id":723256857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzI1Njg1Nw==","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T19:24:09Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T19:24:09Z","body":"Marking
