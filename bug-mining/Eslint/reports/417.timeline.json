I  was able to further reduce the origin of the error:\r\n- The error is thrown by a plugin rule `import/no-unused-modules`. Unfortunately the stacktrace does not include that information. \r\nThrowing a custom `Error`, points me to it:  . https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/blob/04f3cae17fe07b2fd0b74fd3e88482b3094e75e3/lib/config-array-factory.js#L419-L428\r\n```js\r\nconstructor({\r\n        additionalPluginPool = new Map(),\r\n        cwd = process.cwd(),\r\n        resolvePluginsRelativeTo,\r\n        builtInRules,\r\n        resolver = ModuleResolver,\r\n        eslintAllPath,\r\n        eslintRecommendedPath\r\n    } = {}) {\r\n        if(!eslintRecommendedPath) throw new Error('xx'); // <<==\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n- After commenting plugin `import` in `*.eslintrc.json`, ESLint works as expected :D . I guess this issue is no longer within scope of ESLint right? It was just a bit hard to pin down the error source, because no `rule` name is shown in the stacktrace. \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"plugins\": [\r\n    \"@typescript-eslint\",\r\n    // \"import\",          // <<== error cause\r\n    \"jsdoc\",\r\n    \"json\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/716164399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"exodus4d","id":9299033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTkwMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9299033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d","html_url":"https://github.com/exodus4d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"exodus4d","id":9299033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTkwMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9299033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d","html_url":"https://github.com/exodus4d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-25T18:22:47Z","updated_at":"2020-10-25T18:22:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/1931","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/import-js/eslint-plugin-import","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/1931/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/1931/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/1931/events","html_url":"https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/1931","id":729081228,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MjkwODEyMjg=","number":1931,"title":"[no-unused-modules] The \"path\" argument must be of type string.
