(place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Enforces code style (layout)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint compact-accessor:error*/\r\nvar foo = {\r\n    get a(){},\r\n    bar: 5,\r\n    set a(val){}\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar foo = {\r\n    get a(){},\r\n    ...bar,\r\n    set a(val){}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass foo {\r\n    get a(){}\r\n    bar(){}\r\n    set a(val){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint compact-accessor:[\"error\", \"getBeforeSet\"]*/\r\nvar foo = {\r\n    set a(val){},\r\n    get a(){}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass foo {\r\n    set a(val){}\r\n    get a(){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nWhile it is allowed, I don't think there is a real use case for non-consecutive definitions of accessor functions for the same property, and it should be a best practice to avoid this feature. Also, the additional option can enforce a consistent style (e.g., `get` before `set`).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the rule's name, there could be a better word than `compact` for this.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* The rule does not enforce the existence of the pair for a getter/setter (that's `accessor-pairs`). \r\n* The rule does not require grouping of all accessor properties at the same place, it works with each individually.\r\n* If a property has a duplicate getter or setter, such property will be ignored by this rule and caught by other rules (`no-dupe-keys` and `no-dupe-class-members`)\r\n\r\nProblem: This rule is overlapping with `sort-keys`. But, one might want to enforce this without sorting. Also, `sort-keys` doesn't work with classes and doesn't enforce get/set order.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nYes.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12277/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
