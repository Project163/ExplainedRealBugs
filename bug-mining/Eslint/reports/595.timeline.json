(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nUpdated `function assertIsRuleSeverity` to ensure that rule severities are case-sensitive in flat config.\r\n\r\nThis means that configurations such as `\"no-alert\": \"Off\"` or `\"no-alert\": [\"Error\"]` will be invalid.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to inline configuration comments. For example, `/* no-alert: \"Error\" */` will be invalid in the flat config mode after this change. It remains valid in the eslintrc mode (I added a test to verify).\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nCurrently (before this change), in the flat config mode, uppercase severities are effectively already not allowed in configuration files even though they pass the initial validation, because they turn into `undefined` while merging config objects, but they are allowed in inline configuration comments.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004
