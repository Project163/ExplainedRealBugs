I have to say, I also call it `FormatterFunction` in my projects, because I don't know any better name. But @btmills' suggestion seems very reasonable to me. At least it would make things clearer, especially because people seem to think that the type `Formatter` is - what else? - the type of a formatter, despite the documentation making it clear that it's used for something different. I've seen this myself generating [some confusion](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/discussions/58761#discussioncomment-2169486) in discussions, so I guess it's not only my impression.
