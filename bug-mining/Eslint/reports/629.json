But I think that having this would be especially valuable for cases with a multiple branches, where it doesn't literally terminate in a `break`/`return`. For example, something like\r\n```js\r\nfunction myBigConfusingSwitch() {\r\n  const aVariable = \"something\";\r\n  switch (aVariable) {\r\n    case 1:\r\n      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\r\n        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\r\n          console.log('do something!')\r\n          return 42;\r\n        } else if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\r\n          console.log('do something!');\r\n          break;\r\n        } else {\r\n          break;\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        return 4242\r\n      }\r\n      // fallthrough\r\n    case 2:\r\n      // did I fall through or not?\r\n      console.log('do something in case 2!')\r\n      break;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that if I put code where the `fallthrough` comment is, it would get flagged for being unreachable\r\n\r\nPS I discovered this organically, making this very mistake during refactoring","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18182/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
