If you are proposing a new rule, please continue on. If you are here for another reason, please see below:\r\n\r\n    1. To report a bug: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/reporting-bugs\r\n    2. To request a rule change: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/rule-changes\r\n    3. To request a change that is not a bug fix, rule change, or new rule: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/changes\r\n    4. If you have any questions, please stop by our chatroom: https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint\r\n\r\n    Note that leaving sections blank will make it difficult for us to troubleshoot and we may have to close the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Please describe what the rule should do:**\r\n\r\nEnforce `default` clauses in `switch` statements to be last.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Suggests an alternate way of doing something (suggestion)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nswitch (foo) {\r\n  case 1:\r\n    bar();\r\n    break;\r\n  default:\r\n    baz();\r\n    break;\r\n  case 2:\r\n    quux();\r\n    break;    \r\n}\r\n\r\nswitch (foo) {\r\n  default:\r\n    doSomethingForNonZero();\r\n    // fallthrough\r\n  case 0:\r\n    doSomethingForAll();\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nThis rule enforces a common convention. \r\n\r\nEven if a non-last `default` might make sense for a specific situation, it's better to refactor the code to a more understandable version.\r\n\r\nA non-last `default` is, I believe, unexpected for readers. A reader might not know if it is a valid code at all, and what's the actual behavior (does the evaluation stop when it finds `default` in the middle, does it execute the `default` block and then continue searching, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis rule applies only to `switch` statements that already have `default` clauses. It doesn't enforce the existence of `default` clauses (there is the `default-case` rule for that purpose). \r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12665/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12665/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
