for the report. I agree with you that the current interface is a bit confusing. We don't currently support parsing imports without parsing the rest of ES6, and as you've noticed, `sourceType: module` implicitly enables ES6 parsing.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I'm not sure it would be worthwhile to introduce a error for this case, because there are probably a significant number of users relying on this behavior. We try to avoid breaking peoples' builds unnecessarily, even in major releases. (It's probably uncommon for users to do something like `{ ecmaVersion: 5, sourceType: module }` explicitly, but `ecmaVersion: 5` is the default, so anyone currently using `{ sourceType: module }` and expecting modules to be parsed is relying on this behavior.)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/349454051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/349593903","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9687#issuecomment-349593903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9687","id":349593903,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTU5MzkwMw==","user":{"login":"timruffles","id":249800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTgwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/249800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles","html_url":"https://github.com/timruffles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timruffles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-06T10:11:01Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T10:11:09Z","body":"@not-an-aardvark I would say breaking builds here is desirable.
