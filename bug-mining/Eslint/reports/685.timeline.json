believe this needs to be an error . Leaving the suppressions file un-pruned for a long time is a risk, and eventually it will open the door for new errors to go unnoticed.\n\nFor example developer A addresses ten violations from file `foobar.js`. Then this is merged into `main` without updating the suppressions file. As a result, other developers can introduce ten new violations for the same rule , same file without any error. \n\nGiven the use case provided here, another option would be to exit with a dedicated exit code i.e. `3` instead of `2` so that it can be ignored when needed.

Changing it to something else means they'd have to implement special logic in their CI to handle this case.\n\nAnd this is my point: I can see a situation where some people want a 0 exit code for this purpose while others might want to specifically detect unprune suppressions, in which case an option to set the exit code is preferable over one that just sets it back to 0.\n\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2894728963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2894884480","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19723#issuecomment-2894884480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19723","id":2894884480,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6sjG6A","user":{"login":"softius","id":586121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjEyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/586121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius","html_url":"https://github.com/softius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/softius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-20T15:30:45Z","updated_at":"2025-05-20T15:30:45Z","body":"I see your point @nzakas , and I think we are aligned on the options we want to provide :) \n\nLet me expand a bit more: if we change the `return 2` to `return 3` when there are unpruned suggestions and keep it dedicated just for this case - then we don't need to introduce `--unpruned-suppressions-exit-code`.\n\nPeople that want to ignore unpruned suppressions can go with the simple `--pass-on-unpruned-suppressions`, instead of `--unpruned-suppressions-exit-code 0`.\n\nPeople that want to handle unpruned suppressions differently can check the exit code and perform the corresponding action without the need to specify `--unpruned-suppressions-exit-code 3` or whatever exit code they decide to go with (since elsint will always exit with exit code 3 for unpruned suppressions)\n\nI think allowing to choose the exit code might lead to conflicts later on . For example, someone decides to do `--unpruned-suppressions-exit-code 3` and few months down the road eslint also introduces exit code 3.
