(place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[ ] Enforces code style\r\n[x] Warns about a potential error\r\n[ ] Suggests an alternate way of doing something\r\n[ ] Other (please specify:)\r\n\r\nNot sure about the rule name but I think this would be a good thing to avoid in any circumstances as it is very surprising.\r\n\r\nJake Archibald explains it very well here https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/999610181452533760\r\n\r\nSo to sum it up this should warn:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet x =  0;\r\n\r\nasync function test() {\r\n  x += await 2;\r\n  console.log(x)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand this\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet x =  0;\r\n\r\nasync function test() {\r\n  x = x + await 2;\r\n  console.log(x)\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this should be ok\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet x =  0;\r\n\r\nasync function test() {\r\n  let two = await 2;\r\n  x = x + two;\r\n  console.log(x)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nIt's not related to any library and can be a source for really confusing bugs. This is not a very well known Javascript feature and I think it should be considered to be a \"bad part\" which should be avoided.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10405/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
