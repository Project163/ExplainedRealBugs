At that point, we didn't know what options people wanted and the number of rules was very small. It seems like the current questions don't make sense for how ESLint is used today. For example, forcing people to pick a style guide doesn't make sense for everyone and sends a message that ESLint is used primarily for styling. I'd like to update the behavior of `--init` to better reflect current users expectations and usage.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\n**Remove autoconfig option.** I'm not sure how people feel about this, but I'm skeptical that this option is used all that much thanks to the popularity of shareable configs. I'm in favor of removing it if others agree but have no problem leaving it in if people feel it's still helpful. \r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this
