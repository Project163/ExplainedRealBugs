rules should only be enabled on typescript files. This is important for repositories with both normal JS and TS.\r\n\r\nI ran into this problem when creating a universal eslint config for my projects.  Typescript eslint rules were being enabled on normal javascript files causing a missing typescript dependency eslint error. I've [manually imported them as a solution](https://github.com/chrisblossom/eslint-config/blob/99fac9db5cabc586fbfec0e1dca7060955017443/lib/typescript.js), added [Typescript detection script](https://github.com/chrisblossom/eslint-config/commit/f0992b44fea7b6ca8233c6d856188a72835ba577) but I think this should be fixed here.\r\n\r\nThis PR also enables overrides on `.dot` files for eslint < v6. See: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/11225 and https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11201\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to put a PR in for sometime now, but https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/501#issuecomment-513580519 motivated me to put in now because this is might be considered a breaking change.\r\n\r\nLooks to close https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/109\r\nSimilar: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/615\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2671504084,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjY3MTUwNDA4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2671504084","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T22:18:31Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2671504089,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2NzE1MDQwODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2671504089","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T22:18:32Z","label":{"name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
