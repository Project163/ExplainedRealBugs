Picking the current Node version(s) at the time of a major release,\n>    and supporting everything at or above it (this is roughly what we did for\n>    ESLint 5 by supporting Node ^6.14.0).\n>    2. Picking a Node version based on specific features that we want to\n>    use in ESLint (e.g. next major release, we could decide to only support\n>    Node >=8.9.0 to ensure we can use the paths option in require.resolve\n>    <https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options>\n>    ).\n>    3. Picking the first Node version in a major release line (this is\n>    what we did for previous ESLint versions, e.g. ESLint 3 supported Node\n>    >=4.0.0).\n>    4. Start out with any of the above, and sometimes add support for\n>    earlier versions in the middle of a release line based on user demand.\n>\n> Personally, I think options 1 or 2 are better than options 3 and 4.
