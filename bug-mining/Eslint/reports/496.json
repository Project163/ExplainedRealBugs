See [codes](https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/blob/be0f70dacaa3ea1f0f606d240e5f63435b34810e/lib/cascading-config-array-factory.js#L363).\r\nAnd docs also mention that personal configuration files are deprecated. See [link](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#personal-configuration-files-deprecated).\r\n\r\nBut there are somewhere makes me confused, like [section 1](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#using-configuration-files) and [section 2](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy).\r\n\r\n> ESLint will automatically look for them in the directory of the file to be linted, and in successive parent directories all the way up to the root directory of the filesystem (unless root: true is specified).\r\n\r\n> ESLint then searches up the directory structure, merging any .eslintrc files it finds along the way until reaching either a .eslintrc file with root: true or the root directory.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nMy point is that those 2 sentences should be updated to reflect the change. Emphasize the ~~root~~ home directory is ignored now. Forgive me if I misunderstood something.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
