there! I'm the author of [a processor plugin](https://github.com/sveltejs/eslint-plugin-svelte3) that produces named code blocks, which are confusing this plugin, because the new virtual path for the js files is now one additional layer down.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this plugin is something that was considered when named code blocks were added in ESLint 6, or whose responsibility it's going to be to fix this. I'll gladly make changes to my plugin if that's what it takes, but right now I don't know what those would be.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n- The issue on my plugin:

For example, people can give an arbitrary string as a filename.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { CLIEngine } = require(\"eslint\");\r\nconst engine = new CLIEngine();\r\n\r\nengine.executeOnText(\"console.log('hello')\", \"a-dummy-filename.js\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, ESLint doesn't check if the file path is valid or not.\r\n\r\nAlso, `eslint` command supports piping and `context.getFilename()` returns `\"<input>\"` if piped.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, processors may make dummy filenames for each code block. It must be a path that people can distinguish between code blocks and files by glob patterns because people often use different settings for code blocks. By design, it's like the child file of the original file. (for example, yes, https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-processor.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI feel that this is related to #12133. If we added `context.getRealFilename()`, should it guarantee that the returned path exists as a file?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/524272920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/524332380","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11989#issuecomment-524332380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11989","id":524332380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDMzMjM4MA==","user":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-23T14:16:47Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T14:16:47Z","body":"You say “by design”, but to me that seems like a broken design, because making it be in a subdir changes relative paths.
