the maintainer of [`graphql-eslint`](https://github.com/B2o5T/graphql-eslint) package.\r\nThere is no this problem when I apply suggestions on `*.graphql` files directly\r\n\r\nI verified another rule that does not do `fixer.replaceText` but `fixer.remove` and received exact same behaviour, suggestions are broken if I add 2nd item.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nshould not break code if there are more than 2 items in suggest array on processed code\r\n\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n\r\nSuggestions works on `*.js` files only if there is 1 item in the `suggest` array\r\nSuggestions works well on `*.graphql` files if there are 2 items in suggest\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\r\n\r\n### Additional
