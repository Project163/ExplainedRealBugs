The bug is observable in (rare) patterns that are valid with the `u` flag but invalid without it. For example, the rule fails to report `\\x1F` in `/\\u{1111}*\\x1F/u` because `regexpp` stops parsing the pattern after `\\u{1111}*` since it is invalid without the `u` flag.\r\n\r\nHere's a demo with examples: [Online Demo](https://eslint.org/demo#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)","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15809/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
