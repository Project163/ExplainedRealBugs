But still - given that the flat config items are anonymous, it not obvious what config are for what purpose.\r\n\r\nThus in the config viewer, and my own eslint-config, I spontaneously invented the convention of having that name field convention in my config and displaying name in the viewer. for example like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport eslint from '@eslint/js'\r\n\r\nexport default [\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'eslint:js', // assign custom name to other config\r\n    ...eslint \r\n  }, \r\n  {\r\n    name: 'antfu:ts',\r\n    // ts plugins & rules...\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'antfu:vue',\r\n    // vue plugins & rules...\r\n  }\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'antfu:vue:disables':\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1448\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 14 46 39\" src=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/assets/11247099/b6023da2-779f-4303-b81d-cae424fec9c5\">\r\n\r\nWhich I believe helps a lot on communications as well as some userland overrides like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nflatConfigs\r\n    .find(c => c.name === 'stylistic')\r\n    .rules['indent'] = 'off'\r\n\r\nexport default flatConfigs\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\nEven if it \"kinda works\" right now, as ESLint is not compliant about the extra `name` properties (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17842#issuecomment-1867091246). But I think it would be great for the ecosystem to make it an official supported way and develop a convention across the ecosystem. The shared configs from plugins could have their plugin name as the prefix for their configs for example.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that, I think we could:\r\n\r\n- Add `name` to the flat config schema, and add it in `@types/eslint`\r\n- Add a doc section to recommend plugins/configs authors to provide that field with a convention (could be `namespace:scope:sub-scope` or `namespace/scope` etc, but more like a convention, not a constraint)\r\n- Integrations like https://github.com/antfu/eslint-flat-config-viewer could follow up that convention to provide a better DX for users,\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18231/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
