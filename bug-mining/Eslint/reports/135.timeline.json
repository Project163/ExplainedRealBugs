(Give an overview)**\r\nFixed the logic in `lib/rules/camelcase.js`, and added a test that would've been broken before the fix\r\n\r\nBasically, there appears to have been faulty logic introduced by #10373:\r\n\r\nThis guard (pre-#10373) was preventing reporting the `key` of a `Property`:\r\n```\r\nnode.parent.key === node && node.parent.value !== node\r\n```\r\nThen #10373 replaced that guard with this:\r\n```\r\n!assignmentKeyEqualsValue && node.parent.key === node\r\n```\r\nThe hole introduced in the logic is if `assignmentKeyEqualsValue` but `node.parent.key !== node.parent.value`, the `value` gets reported twice (once while visiting the `key` and once while visiting the `value`)\r\n\r\nI believe that the only reason existing `invalid` tests like `var { category_id } = query;` weren't failing on duplicate warnings is that the default parser (`espree`?) must reuse the same `Identifier` node for the `key` and `value` of a shorthand `Property` (as opposed to the Coffeescript custom parser I'm working on, which doesn't reuse the same node, thus how I found this bug)\r\n\r\nBut then by adding an `invalid` test for `var { category_id: category_id } = query;`, you get a duplicate warning (it exposes the hole in the logic, since `assignmentKeyEqualsValue` but the `Property`'s `key` and `value` are two different `Identifier` objects)\r\n\r\nSo the fix is basically to restore the pre-#10373 guard logic so that you effectively never visit the `Property` `key`\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1811047986,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MTEwNDc5ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1811047986","actor":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-27T16:41:36Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1811047997,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MTEwNDc5OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1811047997","actor":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-27T16:41:36Z","label":{"name":"rule","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1811048005,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MTEwNDgwMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1811048005","actor":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-27T16:41:36Z","label":{"name":"evaluating","color":"fef2c0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1811048010,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTgxMTA0ODAxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1811048010","actor":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organiz

It seemed most appropriate to store the custom `CodePathAnalyzer` in the `SourceCode` object along with the other custom parser hooks\r\n\r\nI'm assuming I'll also need to try and provide a monkeypatching fallback (a la `babel-eslint`) when running against a version of ESLint that doesn't support this new custom parser hook. But it's working nicely running against this branch, I'm successfully using a customized version of ESLint's `CodePathAnalyzer` (and friends)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Please ensure your pull request is ready:\r\n\r\n    - Read the pull request guide (https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/pull-requests)\r\n    - Include tests for this change\r\n    - Update documentation for this change (if appropriate)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    The following is required for all pull requests:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make?
