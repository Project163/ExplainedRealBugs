(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nnew default behavior\r\n\r\nIt would be also good to ensure that the reported variables are global.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint no-obj-calls: \"error\"*/\r\n/*eslint-env es2017*/\r\n\r\nAtomics();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nNo errors\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\nError: `'Atomics' is not a function.` \r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes. The idea is to add `Atomics` and also use `ReferenceTracker` to report only global variables (for all 4 targeted globals) in the same PR.\r\n\r\nWould it be okay for a semver-minor? I think that when `Reflect` was added to this rule it was seen as a bug fix (#7710 #7700).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12234/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
