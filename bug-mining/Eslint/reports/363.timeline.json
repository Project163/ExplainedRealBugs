(2nd one would give an error but tough example)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's great. The rule description did not make it as clear parser understands the difference. The variable [example ](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-use-before-define#variables) was a direct value link and it should probably mention it includes variables as functions. \r\n\r\nI saw this come up a lot while searching and people usually trying the `functions` and/or `nofunc` rule - ~~it's really strange classes go into nofunc but not arrow functions~~. People often treat variables linked to functions, links by references, and links by value different.\r\n\r\ne.g. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9861#issuecomment-359027436\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to simply just mention variables as functions or arrow functions in variables exception paragraph, would've been enough for me.\r\n\r\nThank you x

I saw this come up a lot while searching and people usually trying the `functions` and/or `nofunc` rule - it's really strange classes go into nofunc but not arrow functions. People often treat variables linked to functions, links by references, and links by value different.\r\n\r\n`nofunc` sets just `\"functions\": false`, not `\"classes\"`.\r\n\r\nI agree, `\"functionDeclarations\"` instead of `\"functions\"` would probably avoid confusion about the meaning of this option (though, the documentation does state that the option applies to function declarations only).\r\n\r\n> My suggestion is to simply just mention variables as functions or arrow functions in variables exception paragraph, would've been enough for me.\r\n\r\nAgreed! It would be nice to add some examples with function expressions and arrow functions, in the [variables](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-use-before-define#variables) section.\r\n\r\nMarking this as an
