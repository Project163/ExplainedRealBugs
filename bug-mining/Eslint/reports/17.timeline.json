@Ben-Shirley, thanks for contributing. It looks like that would be a good start for fixing this issue, but I think there are a few cases that would also need to be handled:\r\n\r\n* The rule should not report an error for code like this, because the template literal has a placeholder:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    foo[`bar${baz}`];\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* When the `allowKeywords` option is false, the rule should not report an error for code like this:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    foo[`while`];\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nIf I'm reading the existing code correctly, I think modifying only line 61 would cause the rule to report an error in those two cases. It seems like there are a couple of other small checks that need to be added to make sure those cases are handled correctly.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can clarify anything.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/332242364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1266038751,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI2NjAzODc1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1266038751","actor":{"login":"Benny1007","id":32260961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjYwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32260961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007","html_url":"https://github.com/Benny1007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-26T15:47:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1266038752,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyNjYwMzg3NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1266038752","actor":{"login":"Benny1007","id":32260961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjYwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32260961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007","html_url":"https://github.com/Benny1007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Benny1007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-26T15:47:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1266887789,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyNjY4ODc3ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1266887789","actor":{"login":"philquinn","id":17152391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTUyMzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17152391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn","html_url":"https://github.com/philquinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philquinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"209a2ff5460929e8f93262ee4ebb57ff9ec0f99f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/philquinn/eslint/

","body":"@Ben-Shirley I'm sure someone else could probably expand on this as its mainly new to myself too. \r\nBoth MemberExpression and quasi are different parts of the AST (abstract syntax tree) which is generated by Espree (which is what eslint uses). \r\n\r\n`TemplateLiteral` has a list of quasis which are made up of `TemplateElement` which make up the full template literal. In the case of the bug here, it will only have one quasi if we want to show the eslint error.\r\n`MemberExpression` is another part the tree and is made up of an object and property.\r\n\r\nFor example `console.log(``name``)` // ignore the double backtick\r\n\r\nAbove is a `MemberExpression` with a object of `console` and property of `log` and there is  `TemplateLiteral` with a value of `name`. These make up a `CallExpression`.\r\n\r\nhttps://astexplorer.net/#/gist/73a678101ff196b50b5e2ef7526ad00b/9f41b299ca1080eea3ce76a7c6741dbe8d8aeb1a is what is generated from the above example.\r\n\r\nEspree is based off esprima. These docs are kinda nice but a little light, but it shows all the different expressions. https://esprima.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax-tree-format.html#expressions-and-patterns\r\n\r\nhttps://astexplorer.net/ is a pretty good way of visualising the generated AST.\r\n\r\nI hope that was
