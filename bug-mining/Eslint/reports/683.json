👏\n\nHowever, adding `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` as a direct dependency of the core library package bloats the dependency graphs of users who don't use the MCP at all.\n\nI noticed this when a seemingly routine `pnpm up` caused a `+600` diff in the `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Sure enough, the culprit was `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Here are the [declared dependencies](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/621ccea997bf318ee99c7f64ce19609e838615fa/package.json#L48-L59) in the `package.json`.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nSpin off the MCP server as its own _separate_ CLI package from the core ESLint CLI package.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nAs I'd like to minimize the dependency surface of my projects, I consider this to be an essential refactor.","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19682/reactions","total_count":63,"+1":63,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
