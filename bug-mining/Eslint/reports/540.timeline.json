Environment\n\nNode version: v18.10.0\r\nnpm version: v8.19.2\r\nLocal ESLint version: v8.25.0 (Currently used)\r\nGlobal ESLint version: Not found\r\nOperating System: darwin 21.6.0\n\n### What parser are you using?\n\nDefault (Espree)\n\n### What did you do?\n\nUsing `FlatESLint`, the method `getRulesMetaForResults` thows an error for certain values of the option `cwd` when passed a result of an anonymous file. This happens whenever `cwd` is set to a subdirectory of the current directory.\r\n\r\nThe following repro shows the problem.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { join } from 'path';\r\n\r\nconst { default: { FlatESLint } } = await import('eslint/use-at-your-own-risk');\r\n\r\nconst cwd = join(process.cwd(), 'test'); // subdir 'test' doesn't need to exist for this repro.\r\nconst eslint = new FlatESLint({\r\n    cwd,\r\n    overrideConfig: { rules: { 'no-undef': 'warn' } },\r\n    overrideConfigFile: true,\r\n});\r\nconst results = await eslint.lintText('foo()');\r\neslint.getRulesMetaForResults(results); // throws TypeError\r\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nCalling `getRulesMetaForResults` with the result of an anonymous file should not throw an error, regardless of the engine's `cwd`.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nThe above repro fails with an error like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n.../node_modules/eslint/lib/config/flat-config-helpers.js:54\r\n    const plugin = config.plugins && config.plugins[pluginName];\r\n                          ^\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'plugins')\r\n    at getRuleFromConfig (.../node_modules/eslint/lib/config/flat-config-helpers.js:54:27)\r\n    at FlatESLint.getRulesMetaForResults (.../node_modules/eslint/lib/eslint/flat-eslint.js:703:30)\r\n    at file://.../example.mjs:12:8\r\n</pre>\r\n\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nWhat strikes me in the implementation are the different values used to call `configs.getConfig` in the case of an anonymous file: `lintText` calls `configs.getConfig` with a full path like `${cwd}/__placeholder__.js`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/173e82040895ad53b2d9940bfb3fb67a0478f00b/lib/eslint/flat-eslint.js#L956\r\n\r\nwhereas `getRulesMetaForResults` ends up calling `configs.getConfig(\"__placeholder__.js\")`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/173e82040895ad53b2d9940bfb3fb67a0478f00b/lib/eslint/flat-eslint.js#L689-L699\r\n\r\nThen it finds no config and it fails.\r\n\r\nAnother issue related to this is the unhelpful message of the `TypeError`.\r\nWhen `getRulesMetaForResults` finds no matching config, it could simply tell the user that the results were not created from the current instance of ESLint (not the case here, but still).\r\nThe error message is already there, but it is currently only used in a more limited edge case:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/173e82040895ad53b2d9940bfb3fb67a0478f00b/lib/eslint/flat-eslint.js#L684\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-13T17:31:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T17:31:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13481","id":654882545,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTQ4ODI1NDU=","number":13481,"title":"Implement

issue describes the implementation plan for eslint/rfcs#9, which will take place in several phases:\n\n## Phase 1: Extract current config system\n\n- [x] Create new GitHub repository (`eslint/eslintrc`)\n- [x] Copy`eslintrc` source files and tests into new GitHub repository\n- [x] Create Jenkins release job for `@eslint/eslintrc`\n- [x] Publish `@eslint/eslintrc` to npm\n- [x] Update ESLint to use `@eslint/eslintrc`\n- [x] Remove in-memory filesystem from tests\n- [x] Update `CLIEngine` to use `CascadingConfigArrayFactory` from `@eslint/eslintrc`\n\n## Phase 2: Implement flat config with `eslintrc` compatibility\n\n- [x] Create the `FlatCompat` class in `eslint/eslintrc` repository\n- [x] Create `FlatConfigArray` to represent simple configs\n- [x] Update `Linter` class to understand `FlatConfigArray` objects\n- [x] Ensure `Linter#defineRule` and `Linter#definePlugin` throw errors when using `FlatConfigArray`\n- [x] Add `context.languageOptions` in backwards-compatible way to `context` in `Linter`\n- [x] Ensure `context.parserPath` still works in `Linter` for `FlatConfigArray` (for now)\n- [x] Create `FlatRuleTester` to allow rule testing with `FlatConfigArray` format\n- [x] Create `FlatESLint` class to mirror `ESLint` class but use `eslint.config.js` instead\n- [x] #15661\n- [x] #15683\n- [x] #15687\n- [x] Implement caching\n- [x] Update `cli.js` to search for `eslint.config.js` file and use `FlatESLint` if found (`ESLint` if not)\n- [x] Ensure invalid CLI flags cause errors when using flat config (for example, `--resolve-plugins-relative-to`)\n- [x] Switch `eslint/eslint` repo to use flat config\n- [x] Document flat config\n- [x] Release ESLint with `eslintrc` compatibility\n- [x] #16416\n- [x] #16415\n- [x] #16414 \n- [x] #16413 \n- [x] #16410 \n- [x] #16402 \n- [x] #16341 \n- [x] #16340 \n- [x] #16299 \n- [x] #16275 \n- [x] #16265 \n- [x] #16264\n- [x] #16537\n- [x] #16875\n\n## Phase 3: Compatibility testing\n\n- [ ] Work with `typescript-eslint` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/6836))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-import` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2829 https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2873\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-config-airbnb` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic)\n- [x] Work with `eslint-config-standard` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/pull/277)]\n- [x] Work with `eslint-plugin-n` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n/pull/95))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-vue` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/pull/2226))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-react` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/pull/3600))\n- [x] Switch ESLint config to load external configs/plugins without `FlatCompat`\n- [x] Release ESLint with extended compatibility\n\n## Phase 4: General availability (v9.0.0)\n\n- [x] Write blog post about flat config format\n- [x] Output warning when people use `eslintrc` files\n- [x] Switch documentation so `eslint.config.js` is the default and recommended format (link to legacy `eslintrc` docs from the same page)\n- [x] Switch `Linter` to use flat config by default\n- [x] Switch documentation for shareable configs to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] Switch documentation for plugins to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] #14308\n- [x] Rename `ESLint` class to `LegacyESLint` and rename `FlatESLint` to `ESLint`\n- [x] Delete `RuleTester` class and rename `FlatRuleTester` to `RuleTester`\n- [x] Update `api.js` to export new values for `ESLint` and `RuleTester`\n- [x] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to return `true` except if `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` is `false`.\n- [x] Release ESLint with GA flat config\n\n## Phase 5: Remove `eslintrc` (v10.0.0)\n\n- [ ] Remove old CLI flags\n- [ ] Remove `context.parserPath`, `context.parserOptions`, `context.globals` in `Linter` (#20086, eslint/rewrite#263)\n- [ ] Remove `configType` constructor option for `Linter`; throw error if found.\n- [ ] Report an error when `eslint-env` config comment is used (#20128)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` support (#20037)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` documentation\n- [ ] Delete `FlatESLint` class\n- [ ] Delete `LegacyESLint` class\n- [ ] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to always return `true` \n- [ ] Release ESLint without `eslintrc`

Also changed the assertion to check both error message and constructor.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004
