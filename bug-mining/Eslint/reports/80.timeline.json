content of the for loop should be inside TDZ\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about it. Temporal Dead Zone is a timing matter (`Temporal` means a thing about time). I.e., if it touches a certain variable before that variable declaration executes then it throws a ReferenceError. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n    a\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo() // throws a ReferenceError because `let a` hasn't executed. This is in TDZ.\r\nlet a\r\nfoo() // works because `let a` has executed. This is not in TDZ.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the following code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (let key in obj) {\r\n  const a = obj[key];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~TDZ doesn't exist because we cannot touch the `key` variable before the variable declaration executes.~~ EDIT: Indeed, `ForInStatement#right` can touch the `key` variable as similar to `let a = a`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, `eslint-scope` analyzes the structure about variables, references and scopes.
