ESLint version\n\nv8.57.0\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nWhen using a flat config, the CLI only ever loads one config; this is resolved depending on where you invoke it. In a monorepo, you may want to have multiple `eslint.config.js` files; this is common for non-flat configs, where child `.eslintrc.json` files merge with their parents.\r\n\r\nIt's a design choice that flat configs no longer merge with parent directories; this is fine, and it seems reasonable that one could write a config like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport rootConfig from \"../../../eslint.config.js\";\r\n\r\nexport default [\r\n    ...rootConfig,\r\n    // Some more stuff\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't acutally work!\r\n\r\n- If you run `eslint .` at the root of the monorepo, eslint only loads the root config. All other configs are ignored, so any of the overrides done by other configs are not reflected.\r\n- If you run `eslint .` inside of the nested dir, now the other config is loaded, so it _sometimes_ works, depending on the current working directory.\r\n- All of the paths inherited from the root array will be relative to the wrong dir entirely, e.g. ignoring `scripts/**` in the root will also ignore `script/**` in the local dir, even if the intent was that only the top level dir was ignored. Or, maybe a rule applied to a completely different location and shouldn't be included at all.\r\n\r\nThe only way to do this is to forego multiple configs entirely. The root `eslint.config.js` could include the overrides for _everything_, or invent a custom config loading mechanism, like (in psuedocode):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { globSync } from \"glob\";\r\n\r\nconst allConfigs = globSync(\"**/eslint.config.json\");\r\n\r\nexport default [\r\n    // ...\r\n    allConfigs.map((f) => {\r\n        // Somehow read in the config, then remap all of its internal `files` globs to match a subdir?\r\n    })\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, now you're loading more configs than may be needed for a given file. This is especially a problem for DefinitelyTyped; the _9244_ package monorepo currently has _2247_ `.eslintrc.json` files:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ find . -iname 'package.json' | wc -l\r\n9244\r\n$ find . -iname '.eslintrc.json' | wc -l\r\n2247\r\n```\r\n\r\nNormally, this would make me quite worried because if you run eslint in parallel per package (like DT does), that could mean `9,244 * 2,247 = 2,0771,268` config loads. But, under flat config, each config is a module, so the runtime should theoretically be reusing that module, so the reality would likely be closer to just \"load 2000 JSON files once\" so long as the config is not invalidated.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't solve the problem of \"what does this config file look like\", however; not everything can be represented in JSON anymore with flat config.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nESLint could look for the closest `eslint.config.js` file. This is similar to old configs, but explicitly _without_ the merging semantics. This would make ESLint working directory invariant; no matter where you run things, you get the same result.\r\n\r\nI understand that there is some concern about the performance of this, but I don't actually think it will cost too much; you only need to walk a given dir once and remember which config applied to it. All in all, that's no more accesses to the disk than you already need to actually be able to list the files you're going to lint.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not fix the other flaw; inheriting another directory's config does not imply any modifications of file globs. If I spread in a parent dir's eslint config, none of the paths will line up, and I have no solution to that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother thing I thought of was to have/suggest a layout like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── eslint.base.config.js - contains the actual shared config\r\n├── eslint.config.js      - imports shared config, all child dir configs\r\n└── packages/\r\n    ├── foo/\r\n    │   └── eslint.config.js  - imports only shared config\r\n    └── bar/\r\n        └── eslint.config.js  - imports only shared config\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would also be cwd-invariant, but is pretty complicated, and also does not solve the problem of re-rooting paths from other configs / removing ones that don't apply to the subdir.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull

So this was not just a feature that one could turn on with a flag, but rather a three-state setting.\r\n\r\n@fasttime The simple answer: we just wouldn't do features like this anymore. We were trying to figure out how to best enable people to use flat config and that's what we came up with. If we had this feature flag functionality, we probably would have just created a flag like `v9_config` to let people opt-in.\r\n\r\n> If an opt-in feature needs an additional option to indicate how it should work, will the presence of the option be sufficient to enable the feature, or should users specify both a flag and the option?\r\n\r\nShort answer: in order to enable a feature, the flag must be present. Can you give a concrete example of what you're describing?\r\n\r\n> Should it also be allowed to opt-in in `eslint.config.js`?\r\n\r\n@kecrily No. This is a session-specific setting, like `--fix`,

> How do you plan to handle opt-in features that require additional configuration? In v8 the environment variable `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` would take one of two values plus the default, i.e. `true` = use flat config, `false` = use eslintrc, or else = detect automatically. So this was not just a feature that one could turn on with a flag, but rather a three-state setting.\r\n> \r\n> @fasttime The simple answer: we just wouldn't do features like this anymore. We were trying to figure out how to best enable people to use flat config and that's what we came up with. If we had this feature flag functionality, we probably would have just created a flag like `v9_config` to let people opt-in.\r\n> \r\n> > If an opt-in feature needs an additional option to indicate how it should work, will the presence of the option be sufficient to enable the feature, or should users specify both a flag and the option?\r\n> \r\n> Short answer: in order to enable a feature, the flag must be present. Can you give a concrete example of what you're describing?\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarifications. The example I had in mind was exactly the one of the environment variable to control the config type. This is mentioned in the issue description to show the limitations of using an environment variable to opt in to a feature (flat config), but it made me also think about the limitations of not having a value (like \"true\", \"false\" or undefined) associated to the flag. I assumed that an additional option would be still necessary to convey that information, alongside the flag.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2124418999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12892080994,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc6I_DOrzwAAAAMAbYti","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/12892080994","actor":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-22T10:16:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12892081013,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc6I_DOrzwAAAAMAbYt1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/12892081013","actor":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-22T10:16:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2127198505","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18458#issuecomment-2127198505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18458","id":2127198505,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5-ynkp","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-23T13:59:44Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T13:59:44Z","body":">
