although the documentation recommends using `ignores` with `files`, [it states that this should work](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new#excluding-files-with-ignores) and omitting `files` should be the same as using `files: '**/*'`.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it works only if I explicitly set `files` in the second configuration object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    rules: {\r\n      \"no-unused-vars\": \"error\",\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    files: [\"**/*\"],\r\n    ignores: [\"error.js\"],\r\n    rules: {\r\n      \"no-unused-vars\": \"warn\",\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
