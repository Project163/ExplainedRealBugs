was confused by this rule as well. I had a read through the discussion in #9989 and had a look at the source code.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the confusion mostly comes from the fact that the rule and the documentation use the terms `\"array\"` and `\"object\"`, while what the code is actually checking is merely whether the property being accessed is a number or not (in the code: `function isArrayIndexAccess(node) {return Number.isInteger(node.property.value);}`). Hence the following counter-intuitive situations:\r\n\r\n- Accessing an array element through a computed index will fall under the category `\"object\"`.\r\n- Accessing an object property whose key is an integer will fall under the category `\"array\"`. \r\n\r\nI'm happy to submit a PR to propose 2 sentences that could add some clarification to the documentation.\r\n\r\nUltimately it seems impossible to fully realize the intent of this rule through mere static code analysis...","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/491084963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OliverSieweke","id":30631513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjMxNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30631513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke","html_url":"https://github.com/OliverSieweke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2417148795,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI0MTcxNDg3OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2417148795","actor":{"login":"OliverSieweke","id":30631513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjMxNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30631513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke","html_url":"https://github.com/OliverSieweke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OliverSieweke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2af461c1312abf33f87a189e0ce1888f6885d32b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OliverSieweke/eslint/commits/2af461c1312abf33f87a189e0ce1888f6885d32b","created_at":"2019-06-17T10:30:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
