Environment\n\nNode version: v16.15.1\r\nnpm version: N/A - using yarn\r\nLocal ESLint version: 8.23.0\r\nGlobal ESLint version: no global eslint installed\r\nOperating System: MacOS 12.5.1\r\n\n\n### What parser are you using?\n\n@babel/eslint-parser\n\n### What did you do?\n\nI upgraded eslint-plugin-react from 7.37.1 to 7.37.7.\r\n\r\nDue to new rules addition and the cache for the former version still being used, offenses for those new rules weren't being reported.\r\n\r\nMy code contains the following: \r\n```\r\nconst Componnent = () => {\r\n  return <table>\r\n    <thead>\r\n      <th align=\"center\">title</th>\r\n    </thead>\r\n  </table>\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nOffenses to be reported\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nNothing was reported\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nShould be fixed by this PR:
