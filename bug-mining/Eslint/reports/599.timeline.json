ESLint will search the next parent directory for a config file if it can't find one in the `cwd` ([docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new#configuration-file-resolution)). So, in this case, ESLint finds `../eslint.config.js` and reports `--ext` usage as error, since it's no longer supported in flat config mode.\r\n\r\nI believe this is what is happening in the example. @nzakas @mdjermanovic can you please verify if my assumption on this is correct here?

I'm able to reproduce.\r\n\r\nHere's what's happening: We search for `eslint.config.js` *first*, and that search starts from the current working directory and continues up the directory structure. Because we're doing that first, we find the `eslint.config.js` file and ignore the `.eslintrc` file in the current working directory. If we didn't find `eslint.config.js`, then we'd search for, and find, `.eslintrc`.\r\n\r\nWe do it this way because the eslintrc logic is a lot more complicated and so it's not easy to extract the search for `.eslintrc` from the code in which it's buried. It's simple to look for `eslint.config.js` first and then revert to the eslintrc behavior later if necessary.\r\n\r\nSo in this case, the easiest way to fix the problem is to either remove or rename the `eslint.config.js` file. Another option would be set an environment variable `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false`, which forces ESLint to skip the search for `eslint.config.js`.\r\n\r\nIn the short-term, we can probably add an additional error message that lets people know that some options aren't available when using flat config.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1768852297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10695467161,"node_id":"LE_lADOAKjKDc5z2EnezwAAAAJ9f-CZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10695467161","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-18T16:06:30Z","label":{"name":"accepted","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10695467365,"node_id":"AE_lADOAKjKDc5z2EnezwAAAAJ9f-Fl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10695467365","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-18T16:06:31Z","assignee":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14938114899,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAKjKDc5z2EnezwAAAAN6YYtT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/14938114899","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_u
