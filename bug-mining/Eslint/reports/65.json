This has the following effects:\r\n\r\n* The default formatter (`stylish`) crashes with a `TypeError`.\r\n* The `json` formatter omits the `message` property.\r\n* `RuleTester` works as normal, except that the message assertions are compared against the string `\"undefined\"`.\r\n\r\nThis is almost certainly not desirable for rule authors. It's also not a very good development experience because `RuleTester` might seem to work as expected if a test case only asserts the number of errors, but the actual output will cause the formatter to crash at runtime with a confusing error message.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nWe should make `context.report` throw an error if no report message is supplied.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10011/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10011/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
