for looking at that, @mysticatea. In addition to those class features, there are a few other features we'll be able to start using:\r\n\r\n- `Object.fromEntries()`.\r\n- `Array.prototype.flat()` and `flatMap()`. There's already a todo comment for this in #14287.\r\n- `String.prototype.matchAll()`.\r\n- Separators in numeric literals.\r\n\r\nThose are all supported by every version where ESM is stable.\r\n\r\n- For Node 12, `12.22.0` is the most recent semver-minor release as of writing.\r\n- For Node 14, `14.17.0` is the most recent release as of writing.\r\n- For Node 15, I didn't see anything after `15.3.0` that we'd be able to use. There are some improvements to promise-based APIs and workers that have been backported to 14 but not 12, so we couldn't use them.\r\n- For Node 16, there are syntax features after `16.0.0`, but we wouldn't be able to use them because they haven't been backported.\r\n\r\nI recommend we adopt @mysticatea's version range proposed above: `^12.22.0 || ^14.17.0 ||
