(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nI changed the resolution mechanism for globbing. Previously, we were automatically looking for every glob pattern inside of the cwd, which could result in more files than necessary being linted. Now, we only look at glob patterns relative to the directory passed in on the command line.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the new `shallow-glob` fixture to make sure it makes sense. I verified that the test using these files failed prior to this change and passed after this change.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004

Currently, after switching to `eslint.config.js`, it doesn't lint that file. This went unnoticed because of https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16260 (the script runs `eslint docs` command; the command doesn't really lint any files in `docs`, but it mistakenly lints files outside `docs`, so it doesn't trigger the \"no files matching the pattern\" error).\r\n\r\nThe `eslint docs` command skips `docs/.eleventy.js` because:\r\n\r\n* It's a dotfile (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16265)\r\n* Even if it wasn't a dotfile, it would be skipped because `globby`/`fast-glob` doesn't support negated patterns in `ignore` (https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob/issues/356), and we have `/docs/**` & `!/docs/.eleventy.js` patterns in [`.eslintignore`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/42bfbd7b7b91106e5f279a05f40c20769e3cd29f/.eslintignore#L3-L4).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    If the item you've checked above has a template, please paste the template questions below and answer them.

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\n* Update the command to lint `docs/.eleventy.js` directly. This works because it doesn't go through `globby` so there are no dotfile and unignore issues.\r\n* Synced `eslint.config.js` with `.eslintrc.js` in regard to `eslint-plugin-eslint-plugin` rules. In particular, the rules are removed from the top level because they are detecting `docs/.eleventy.js` as an eslint rule file so there are false positives.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like
