(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\nPerhaps as a default behaviour, as `NaN` and `Number.NaN` are equivalent.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nx === NaN;\r\nx === Number.NaN;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\nOnly the first line is reported as a NaN comparison. Second line does not report.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nBoth lines will report as NaN comparisons. (Maybe recommending `Number.isNaN` instead of `isNaN` but that is aside)\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nI would prefer if someone else send a PR.\r\n\r\nAt [`lib/rules/use-isnan.js:24`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/353ddf9/lib/rules/use-isnan.js#L24):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    return Boolean(node) && node.type === \"Identifier\" && node.name === \"NaN\";\r\n+    return Boolean(node) && (node.type === \"Identifier\" && node.name === \"NaN\" ||\r\n+        node.type === \"MemberExpression\" &&\r\n+        node.object.type === \"Identifier\" && node.object.name === \"Number\" &&\r\n+        node.property.type === \"Identifier\" && node.property.name === \"NaN\");\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
