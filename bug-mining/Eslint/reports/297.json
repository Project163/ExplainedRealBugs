Targets setters in object literals, classes and property descriptors (4 well-known functions).\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Warns about a potential error (problem)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nconst foo = {\r\n    set a(val) { \r\n        this._a = val; \r\n        return val; \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass foo {\r\n    set a(val) { \r\n        this._a = val * 100; \r\n        return this._a; \r\n    }\r\n    static set b(val) {\r\n        doSomething(val);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nObject.defineProperty(obj, \"foo\", { \r\n    set(val) { \r\n        return 5 * val; \r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\n// also Object.defineProperties, Object.create, Reflect.defineProperty\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nReturning a value from a setter is either unnecessary or a possible error in logic (intention to somehow use the returned value when it's different).\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, even if there is an intention to use the value returned from a setter, it's simply impossible in ES. E.g., `a.prop = foo`, `a.prop += foo`, `++a.prop` etc. do not use values returned from setters to evaluate the whole expression.\r\n\r\nI think that just `return;` without value should be allowed, as it can be used for control flow. \r\nReturning any value should be disallowed.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12285/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
