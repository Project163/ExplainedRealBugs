for the report @marcusrbrown. This is not a bug, it's intended that using a feature flag like `unstable_ts_config` after it's no longer needed results in an error. Feature flags are used to activate experimental features that could change anytime, also during a minor release like ESLint v9.18.0.\n\nI think in your case you could simply amend the Renovate PR and remove `--flag unstable_ts_config` from the ESLint command:\n\nhttps://github.com/bfra-me/renovate-action/blob/041f11ba5bec4d080de4ba94497194135d4ee749/package.json#L15 \n\nAm I missing

I had previously brought this up on https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19100#issuecomment-2457741994, where I suggested that the migration path of flags from unstable to stable to removed may be a bit too sharp. I think it makes sense to emit a warning in these situations instead of erroring:\n\n* I think it's reasonable that an unstable flag that is removed because the feature has been merged into HEAD.\n* Similarly, when a flag moves from unstable to stable (as in `unstable_foo` -> `v10_foo`); when the unstable flag is used it should be treated as if the stable flag is used.\n* When a stable flag is removed because its functionality has been merged into HEAD.\n\nIf an unstable flag is removed because the functionality is abandoned, then I think it makes sense to throw an

[@eslint/eslint-tsc](https://github.com/orgs/eslint/teams/eslint-tsc) I think it's worth revisiting the behavior of inactive flags. I had previously brought this up on [#19100 (comment)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19100#issuecomment-2457741994), where I suggested that the migration path of flags from unstable to stable to removed may be a bit too sharp. I think it makes sense to emit a warning in these situations instead of erroring:\n> \n> * I think it's reasonable that an unstable flag that is removed because the feature has been merged into HEAD.\n> * Similarly, when a flag moves from unstable to stable (as in `unstable_foo` -> `v10_foo`); when the unstable flag is used it should be treated as if the stable flag is used.\n>  * When a stable flag is removed because its functionality has been merged into HEAD.\n> \n> If an unstable flag is removed because the functionality is abandoned, then I think it makes sense to throw an error.\n\nRaising warnings for inactive flags was the only expected behavior before #18705. From a user perspective I think that warnings make more sense than errors in most cases because they don't require restricting the version range of the `eslint` dependency when the status of a flag changes, so I'd be in favor of this change. If you want to switch to warnings before the RFC to pass flags as environment variables suggested in #19100, that would be also fine.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2591832863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2593414184","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19337#issuecomment-2593414184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19337","id":2593414184,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6alFwo","user":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-15T16:40:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T16:40:02Z","body":"I

BREAKING CHANGE\r\n\r\n* Refactor tool-associated type definitions and usages in `@xsai/generate-text`, `@xsai/shared-chat`, and `@xsai/tool`, to unify (slightly) the types scattered in the project\r\n* Merge `result` and `args` from `ToolResult` into `ToolCall` to reduce similar types\r\n* Update types exported by `xsai`\r\n\r\n## Other Changes\r\n\r\n* Rename `ToolResult` in `packages/tool/src/index.ts` previously to `Tool` to avoid confusion, since it sounds like an interface for the result of a tool invocation\r\n* Remove `unstable_ts_config` from `eslint.options.flags` as per

Summary:** This issue proposes that we change inactive flags to emit warnings instead of errors in these situations:\n\n* An unstable flag becomes inactive because the feature is now enabled by default.\n* A stable flag becomes inactive because the feature is now enabled by default.\n* A flag moves from unstable to stable. The unstable flag should work just like the stable flag except that it emits a warning.\n\nIf an unstable flag is removed because the functionality is abandoned, then it throws an error.\n\n**TSC Questions:** \n\n1. Should we accept this proposal?\n2. Should inactive flags ever be removed?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2608050058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
