Please include the actual source code causing the issue, as well as the command that you used to run ESLint.**\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the source code below: -->\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n    ...one /* block comment 1 */ // line comment\r\n    , /* block comment 2\r\n    foo bar */\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\n```bash\r\nnode bin/eslint ./file.js --no-eslintrc --rule \"comma-style: error\" --parser-options \"ecmaVersion: 2015\" --fix\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\n\r\nAutofix to work with no syntax error afterwards; or no fix applied\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\nFirst pass autofix results in the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n\r\n    ...one, /* block comment 1 */ // line comment /* block comment 2\r\n    foo bar */\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line comment results in the opening of block comment 2 not taking effect, so the `foo bar` on the next line is not commented. This results in a parser error since `foo bar` is not a valid expression.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThis example is a simplified version of a test case generated by the ESLint fuzz tool.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10632/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
