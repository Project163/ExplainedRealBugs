update RFC says the page /use/configure/plugins should be called \"Configure Plugins\", but made the name here \"Configure Plugins & Parsers\" b/c the page contains parser info as well. there should be separate pages for plugins and parsers b/c they're separate entities. right now keeping page name to have both \"Configure Plugins and Parsers\" b/c page contains both, but will split up pages and have separate \"Configure Plugins\" and \"Configure Parsers\" pages in PR for this issue.\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16763\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16764\r\n-
