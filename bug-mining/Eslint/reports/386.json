(place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Warns about a potential error (problem)\r\n[ ] Suggests an alternate way of doing something (suggestion)\r\n[ ] Enforces code style (layout)\r\n[ ] Other (please specify:)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nwhile (foo) {\r\n    doSomething(foo);\r\n    foo = foo.parent;\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\r\n    if (isSomething(arr[i])) {\r\n        break;\r\n    } else {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndo {\r\n    if (foo.type === \"bar\") {\r\n        return foo;\r\n    } else {\r\n        throw new Error(\"invalid\");\r\n    }\r\n} while (foo);\r\n\r\nfor (foo of bar) {\r\n    if (foo.type === \"bar\") {\r\n        doSomething(foo);\r\n    }\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor (foo in bar) break;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code is correct only if the end of the body is reachable (i.e. loops from the end) or the loop has a `continue` statement.\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nIt's a very possible error in the code, something is missing or something else is at the wrong place.\r\n\r\nEven if it isn't an error the code should be refactored to avoid unnecessary loop syntax.\r\n\r\nThis is a similar type of error as `no-unreachable`, but I think this should be a separate rule because there is no particular unreachable code in these cases (except for the code in `do-while` test and `for-loop` update, but I think that `no-unreachable` doesn't report that).\r\n\r\nIn some cases both `no-unreachable` and this rule can report warnings (e.g. `no-unreachable` for code after the last `break`, this rule for the whole loop), but I think that isn't overlapping.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nYes, I'd love to work on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12381/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
