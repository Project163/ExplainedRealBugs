Since ESLint rules aren't supposed to be aware of other rules, a plugin like this technically isn't supposed to be possible. However it was successfully implemented by monkeypatching a private API `context.eslint.report`), and has been useful to a lot of people for avoiding unused disable comments.\r\n\r\nI just realized that `eslint-plugin-eslint-comments` will be broken in v4.6.0 as a result of d672aef42b2950c710d598cb970d630f49b2be4b, which refactors ESLint's internal reporting logic and removes the private API that was being monkeypatched. With the current version of ESLint on `master`, it is no longer possible to implement something like `eslint-plugin-eslint-comments`, because `context` objects in rules don't have a reference to the underlying `Linter` instance anymore. We [explicitly don't make any guarantees](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api) about the stability of undocumented APIs, but it would still be nice to avoid breaking peoples' linting builds if possible.\r\n\r\nSo we have a few things to consider:\r\n\r\n* Should we revert d672aef42b2950c710d598cb970d630f49b2be4b for now?\r\n* Should we reconsider adding a core feature to warn on unused disable comments? Personally, I don't think using a plugin for this is a good solution in the long-term, because it breaks the boundaries between rules and prevents us from refactoring internal APIs.\r\n\r\ncc @ilyavolodin @mysticatea ","closed_by":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9193/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
