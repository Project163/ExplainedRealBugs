steps:\r\n\r\n- [x] update `id-denylist`\r\n- [x] update `id-length`\r\n- [x] update `id-match`\r\n- [x] check if other rules need updates or not.\r\n- [x] check rules again after rest.\r\n- [x] release `espree` and `eslint-scope`.\r\n- [x] update `package.json` with the new versions of `espree` and `eslint-scope`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRefs #14343\r\nFixes #14632\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to an item)\r\n\r\n[X] Changes an existing rule\r\n[X] Other, please explain: The espree update contains breaking changes.\r\n\r\n#### What changes did you make? (Give an overview)\r\n\r\n- Upgrade espree. This contains a big breaking change about https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/commit/85f41501c536d9141e50f616f5db6b37e5f0b31b. As a result of this AST structure change, some rules (`camelcase`, `id-denylist`, `id-length`, and `id-match`) are broken. This PR contains the fix of those rules as well. It will fix #13021.\r\n- Support public class fields, private class fields, private class methods/accessors, and static of them. You need `parserOptions: { ecmaVersion: 2022 }` to use the new class features. This PR also change a ton of rules to support the new class features.\r\n\r\n| Commit  | Rule                        | Description                                                                                                                      |\r\n| :------ | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| 150fd19 | `camelcase`                 | This is a large refactoring. Now the rule understands code semantics better by using variables and references of `eslint-scope`.\r\n| d8a912b | `class-methods-use-this`    | It perceives functions at class field initializers.\r\n| e50a84c | `computed-property-spacing` | It perceives the computed keys of class fields.\r\n| e7e860f | `func-names`                | Functions at field initializers have inferred names. The rule with `\"as-needed\"` option recognizes that.\r\n| -       | `id-denylist`               | (not yet)\r\n| -       | `id-length`                 | (not yet)\r\n| -       | `id-match`                  | (not yet)\r\n| e5cff29 | `indent`                    | It perceives class fields and indent class fields.\r\n| 553aac0 | `keyword-spacing`           | It's related in three contextual keywords: `get`, `set`, `static`. Tweaks spacing between those and private identifier. And it additinally checks class fields.\r\n| 7da3ed4 | `no-dupe-class-members`     | It perceives public class fields. Duplication of private members is syntax error.\r\n| 4404054, 9d1700d | `no-eval`          | It perceives that `this.eval()` at class field initializers is not eval. The `ast-utils` change in 7ccd811 and 8009406 is related.\r\n| 29275bd | `no-extra-semi`             | It perceives empty class elements preceded by class fields.\r\n| 7ccd811, 8009406 | `no-invalid-this`  | It perceives that `this` in class field initializers is valid.\r\n| 160013d | `no-multi-assign`           | It perceives assignments at class field initializers.\r\n| 06c676c | `no-self-assign`            | It perceives private member accesses.\r\n| 9a494a2 | `no-undef-init`             | It perceives unnecessary `undefined` at class field initializers.\r\n| 4098d55 | `no-underscore-dangle`      | It perceives underscore in private identifiers.\r\n| 40492d3 | `no-unreachable`            | It perceives that class fields are unreachable in rare cases. See also [this comment](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/commit/40492d396437f69b4a02333e80cb68e92d0a8ddf#diff-7951b939b188489129312130dbc19104e2f88db5f2a2a3c0523bd2af48a0eab6R323-R329).\r\n| ef87576 | `no-useless-computed-key`   | It perceives the computed keys of class fields.\r\n| b320bbd | `operator-linebreak`        | It perceives `=` of class field initializers.\r\n| 6fffdc6 | `prefer-exponentiation-operator` | It perceives private identifier and doesn't confused with that. This upgrades `eslint-utils`.\r\n| 803b06a | `quotes`                    | It perceives class fields.\r\n| 7b89143 | `semi-spacing`              | It perceives `;` of class fields.\r\n| b50db18 | `semi-style`                | It perceives `;` of class fields.\r\n| 560e0cf | `semi`                      | It perceives `;` of class fields. Some cases are affected by `beforeStatementContinuationChars` option.\r\n| 04e1ace | `space-infix-ops`           | It perceives `=` of class field initializers.\r\n\r\nAnd this PR adds some tests to a ton of rules.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n- Please check if there are more rules that need to be fixed for class fields.\r\n- More tests?\r\n- Are there wrong fixes by misunderstandings of the spec?\r\n- There are rules that generate new errors for class fields. Is that good?\r\n- A large refactoring exists for `camelcase`, `id-denylist`, `id-length`, and `id-match`. Is this good or not?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14591/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14591/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"NemoStein","id":2738812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzg4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2738812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein","html_url":"https://github.com/NemoStein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NemoStein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-08T01:19:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T01:19:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/standard/standard/issues/1542","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/standard/standard","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/standard/standard/issues/1542/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/standard/standard/issues/1542/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/standard/standard/issues/1542/events","html_url":"https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/1542","id":681339511,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODEzMzk1MTE=","number":1542,"title":"Parsing
