Contrary to what folks have been saying online, this decision with *not* about forcing people to use ESM. Because we were rebuilding the config system from the ground up, we wanted to start with as minimal a feature set as possible to avoid over-engineering the solution. We believed that supporting just `eslint.config.js` would be sufficient for almost all cases because people would most likely want to use the same format (module vs. commonjs) as they were using for their source code. Additionally, CommonJS files can load ESM modules via `import()`, so it seemed like there wasn't a concern about which config files could access which packages.\r\n\r\nWe also provided the `-c` command line flag that would allow anyone to specify an alternate filename, including `.mjs` and `.cjs` files. We thought this would be enough to solve most use cases.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of the DT monorepo coupled with how difficult it is to configure the VS Code ESLint extension for alternate filenames convinced us that a more automatic solution was needed.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nESLint will search for `eslint.config.js`, `eslint.config.mjs`, and `eslint.config.cjs` in that order and the first one found wins and the others will be ignored. Exactly which config file being used will be output using `--debug`, so you'll always be able to tell which one you're using. You won't get a warning if you have multiple config files because we stop searching once the first config file is found.\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\nWe intend to complete this for the alpha release on December 29th, however, we need to wait until we've merged all of the other flat config changes first. Otherwise, there will be a mountain of merge conflicts to deal with.","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17863/reactions","total_count":27,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":10,"rocket":5,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
