investigating just now, I think the issue was introduced in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/commit/e3959199bc681ce2571fac55efa2eb0ba3d0c11a, where we switched to resolving ignore patterns from the location of the `.eslintignore` file rather than the CWD.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that in addition to resolving ignore patterns that appear in the `.eslintignore` file from the ignore file's location, we're also resolving the *default* ignore patterns (such as `/node_modules/*`) from the location of the ignore file, rather than the CWD. So when you use `eslint --ignore-path node_modules/kcd-scripts/dist/config/eslintignore`, it's effectively ignoring files in `node_modules/kcd-scripts/dist/config/node_modules` rather than `./node_modules`, which causes the rest of the files in `./node_modules` to get linted.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the issue seems to be [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/c8bf687711eeb78bb3454f64fea891a788fcc187/lib/ignored-paths.js#L239). `this.baseDir` is currently always set to the location of the ignore file (or the CWD if no ignore file is being used), so we're using the same relative path for both the default ignore patterns and the custom ignore patterns. I *think* the issue will be fixed if we use different relative paths for each check there (a path relative to the CWD for default patterns, and a path relative to the ignore file location for custom patterns).\r\n\r\nedit: I think [this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/c8bf687711eeb78bb3454f64fea891a788fcc187/lib/ignored-paths.js#L276) would also need to be changed in a similar way, too.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/327314557/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/327319680","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9227#issuecomment-327319680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9227","id":327319680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzMxOTY4MA==","user":{"login":"kentcdodds","id":1500684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1500684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds","html_url":"https://github.com/kentcdodds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-05T22:18:32Z","updated_at":"2017-09-05T22:18:32Z","body":"Thanks for that insight!

\"undefined\") || (category === \"default\")) {\r\n+            const relativePath = pathUtil.getRelativePath(absolutePath, this.options.cwd);\r\n             result = result || (this.ig.default.filter([relativePath]).length === 0);\r\n         }\r\n\r\n         if ((typeof category === \"undefined\") || (category === \"custom\")) {\r\n+            const relativePath =

}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, after I commented before I noticed [another place](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/c8bf687711eeb78bb3454f64fea891a788fcc187/lib/ignored-paths.js#L276) that might also need to be changed in a similar way (to resolve default patterns from the `cwd` rather than `this.baseDir`).\r\n\r\n> Also, what's a good place to write tests for this changed behavior? in [`tests/lib/ignored-paths.js`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/e3959199bc681ce2571fac55efa2eb0ba3d0c11a/tests/lib/ignored-paths.js)?\r\n\r\nYes, I think that's the right place to put them.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/327332740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"kentcdodds","id":1500684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1500684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds","html_url":"https://github.com/kentcdodds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T17:01:56Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T17:01:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/issues/10","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/issues/10/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/issues/10/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/issues/10/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/issues/10","id":265350275,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjUzNTAyNzU=","number":10,"title":"Endless

CRA was no problem, but as I moved to dev workflow, trying to run kcd-scripts lint resulted in missing some sort of plugin or config. After doing `yarn add -D the_missing_thing` and repeating the lint command it spat out anther missing dep and so on. I've continued installing more and more of these and each time `kcd-scripts lint` took more and more time to run.\r\nI'm currently on my 10th missing module and I don't think it should be this way :)\r\nThe whole point of the toolkits is to encapsulate dependencies and I get this:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-13 at 7 42 30 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11582927/31556485-f019df16-b04d-11e7-80f7-39429dd85d64.png)\r\n\r\n**Suggested solution**:\r\nI think that `eslint`'s module-resolver is scanning all modules in node_modules and pulling their eslint-configs and then it throws when it doesn't find something. But I'm not sure, it's a wild guess based from the error and I'm pretty sure kcd-scripts does not need stuff like `cssnano` to run.\r\nTBH I don't know why I even have that in my dependencies, but it's node - not surprising:)\r\n\r\nThank you for your work @kentcdodds, I really enjoy all of the OSS things you do.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kentcdodds","id":1500684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1500684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds","html_url":"https://github.com/kentcdodds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-13T17:20:39Z","updated_at":"2017-10-13T17:20:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9430","id":265360738,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQ2NTEwMzc2","number":9430,"title":"fix(ignore-path):
