(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\nAdd a new option called `ignoreBlankLines`, defaults to `true`, which when set to `false` will not trigger the alphabetical sort if the previous line is blank.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n🔴Examples of incorrect code for this rule with the { \"ignoreBlankLines\": true } option:\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint sort-imports: \"error\" */ \r\nimport b from 'foo.js';\r\nimport c from 'baz.js';\r\n\r\nimport a from 'bar.js';\r\nimport x from 'qux.js';\r\n```\r\n\r\n🟢Examples of correct code for this rule with the { \"ignoreBlankLines\": false } option:\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint sort-imports: [\"error\", { \"ignoreBlankLines\": false }]*/\r\nimport b from 'foo.js';\r\nimport c from 'baz.js';\r\n\r\nimport a from 'bar.js';\r\nimport x from 'qux.js';\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\nCurrently the rule doesn't respect blank lines, meaning that even if there is a line break between imports, it will still error out that they're not sorted alphabetically.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nAfter the change, the new option will allow grouping of imports, each of which will be alphabetically sort.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint sort-imports: [\"error\", { \"ignoreBlankLines\": false }]*/\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport moment from 'moment';\r\n\r\n// Components\r\nimport Footer from '@app/footer.js';\r\nimport Header from '@app/header.js';\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nYes","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12951/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12951/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
