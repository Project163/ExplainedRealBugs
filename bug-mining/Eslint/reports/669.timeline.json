However, in certain cases, I can't use `let` or `const` because they don't allow redeclaring variables in the same scope, whereas the `var` examples are redeclared multiple times. To update these with `let` or `const`, we would need to change the variable names to avoid redeclaration. I'm unsure how to proceed—should we leave these examples as they are?\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004
