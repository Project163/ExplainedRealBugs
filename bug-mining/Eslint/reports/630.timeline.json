While your comment is informative, it's not moving the issue through the process, so please keep an eye on that going forward.\n\n@antfu The only reason we haven't documented and recommended using `name` in config objects is because we don't expose that value anywhere. My plan was to include it in thrown errors, so this is a good reminder to go back and do that.\n\nI do think we can have both `name` and `meta.name`, as we already [support both for plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#meta-data-in-plugins).\n\nAlso, the flag config viewer is amazing. Is there any chance you'd be willing to donate that to the ESLint project?

My plan was to include it in thrown errors, so this is a good reminder to go back and do that.\r\n\r\nThat was something really useful indeed - I was about the bring that up as well. I suppose it won't be a conflict to have the ecosystem using the convention as ESLint implements better error messages. Let me know what I can help to move this forward; I am happy to do either the code and/or the documentation if you aren't already working on them.\r\n\r\nGlad to hear you like the config viewer - sure, I am more than happy to donate it if that could help more ppl to get their hands on it!

Describe the feature\n\nI propose enhancing the `@stylistic/eslint-plugin` configuration by including a `name` field for more precise and intuitive configuration adjustments. The current approach, which requires inspecting the plugins array to conditionally modify rules based on the presence of `@stylistic`, introduces unnecessary complexity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, adjustments to ESLint rules within the configuration involve a process of filtering through configurations based on the plugins array, a method that lacks clarity and directness, as demonstrated below:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { createConfigForNuxt, defineFlatConfigs } from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'\r\n\r\nexport default defineFlatConfigs(\r\n  createConfigForNuxt().then((configs) => {\r\n    return configs.map((config) => {\r\n      return config?.plugins && '@stylistic' in config.plugins\r\n        ? {\r\n            ...config,\r\n            rules: {\r\n              ...config.rules,\r\n              // Rule configuration here…\r\n            },\r\n          }\r\n        : config;\r\n    });\r\n  }),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo simplify this process, I suggest adding a `name` field to the configuration. This field would facilitate direct and intuitive identification and modification of the configuration:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { createConfigForNuxt, defineFlatConfigs } from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'\r\n\r\nexport default defineFlatConfigs(\r\n  createConfigForNuxt().then((configs) => {\r\n    return configs.map((config) => {\r\n      return config.name === 'nuxt:stylistic'\r\n        ? {\r\n            ...config,\r\n            rules: {\r\n              ...config.rules,\r\n              // Rule configuration here…\r\n            },\r\n          }\r\n        : config;\r\n    });\r\n  }),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enhancement, inspired by discussions and the expressed need for improved configuration clarity in related ESLint discussions (e.g., https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18231), aims to make ESLint configurations more accessible and easier to manage.\n\n### Additional information\n\n- [X] Would you be willing to help implement this feature?\n- [ ] Could this feature be implemented as a module?\n\n### Final checks\n\n- [X] Read the [contribution guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/contribution).\n- [X] Check existing [discussions](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint/discussions) and [issues](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint/issues).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/eslint/issues/373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/eslint/issues/373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"auvred","id":61150013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTUwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61150013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred","html_url":"https://github.com/auvred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-06T05:28:52Z","updated_at":"2024-04-06T05:28:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8862","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8862/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8862/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8862/events","html_url":"https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8862","id":2229086318,"node_id":"I_kwDOCd3hms6E3Shu","number":8862,"title":"Enhancement: support `name` field in flat config types","user":{"login":"auvred","id":61150013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTUwMDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61150013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred","html_url":"https://github.com/auvred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auvred/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1191708799,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTkxNzA4Nzk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New feature or request"},{"id":3483907368,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCd3hms7PqDUo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/labels/accepting%20prs","name":"accepting prs","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":"Go ahead, send a pull request that resolves this issue"},{"id":7037666025,"node_id":"LA_kwDOCd3hms8AAAABo3pC6Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/labels/locked%20due%20to%20age","name":"locked due to age","color":"efeaea","default":false,"description":"Please open a new issue if you'd like to say more.
