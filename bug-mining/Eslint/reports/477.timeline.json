Bending over backwards to support monkey patching doesn’t seem like the right solution here. I’d like us to take a step back and think this through a bit more.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that you are monkey patching ModuleResolver.resolve so that when ESLint uses it, it’s using the patched version rather than the default, is that correct? And you’re using ESLint via the JS API and not from the CLI?\r\n\r\nIf that’s the case, adding a resolve option to the ESLint class constructor feels like the most appropriate approach to support this use case. It would go away with the new config system, but so will a bunch of other options we currently have.

All of the options to the ESLint class change internal logic.\r\n\r\nI'll try to better explain my view on this option. The interface is `resolve(moduleName, relativeToPath)`. The function doesn't have any context provided, it doesn't know what kind of entity is being resolved and why it should be resolved relative to `relativeToPath`. This should be only a [utility](https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/blob/3b8ae43b32bbe08311a7de0b81bf1219c7cd52d7/lib/shared/relative-module-resolver.js#L2) function that resolves modules per its two parameters, while the logic about how different kinds of entities in different contexts are resolved is in ESLint (e.g., configs relative to the file where they are referenced in `\"extends\"`, plugins relative to project's config file or relative to `--resolve-plugins-relative-to`, etc.). Custom resolvers make sense when the built-in utility cannot work per its specification in some environments. That's not the case here, this option would be used to pass in a function that does _not_ resolve modules relative to `relativeToPath`, and thus alters the logic that isn't its responsibility. This is also fragile because the function isn't aware of the context, so it may be called in a context where its alternative resolution isn't desirable.
