issue describes the implementation plan for eslint/rfcs#9, which will take place in several phases:\n\n## Phase 1: Extract current config system\n\n- [x] Create new GitHub repository (`eslint/eslintrc`)\n- [x] Copy`eslintrc` source files and tests into new GitHub repository\n- [x] Create Jenkins release job for `@eslint/eslintrc`\n- [x] Publish `@eslint/eslintrc` to npm\n- [x] Update ESLint to use `@eslint/eslintrc`\n- [x] Remove in-memory filesystem from tests\n- [x] Update `CLIEngine` to use `CascadingConfigArrayFactory` from `@eslint/eslintrc`\n\n## Phase 2: Implement flat config with `eslintrc` compatibility\n\n- [x] Create the `FlatCompat` class in `eslint/eslintrc` repository\n- [x] Create `FlatConfigArray` to represent simple configs\n- [x] Update `Linter` class to understand `FlatConfigArray` objects\n- [x] Ensure `Linter#defineRule` and `Linter#definePlugin` throw errors when using `FlatConfigArray`\n- [x] Add `context.languageOptions` in backwards-compatible way to `context` in `Linter`\n- [x] Ensure `context.parserPath` still works in `Linter` for `FlatConfigArray` (for now)\n- [x] Create `FlatRuleTester` to allow rule testing with `FlatConfigArray` format\n- [x] Create `FlatESLint` class to mirror `ESLint` class but use `eslint.config.js` instead\n- [x] #15661\n- [x] #15683\n- [x] #15687\n- [x] Implement caching\n- [x] Update `cli.js` to search for `eslint.config.js` file and use `FlatESLint` if found (`ESLint` if not)\n- [x] Ensure invalid CLI flags cause errors when using flat config (for example, `--resolve-plugins-relative-to`)\n- [x] Switch `eslint/eslint` repo to use flat config\n- [x] Document flat config\n- [x] Release ESLint with `eslintrc` compatibility\n- [x] #16416\n- [x] #16415\n- [x] #16414 \n- [x] #16413 \n- [x] #16410 \n- [x] #16402 \n- [x] #16341 \n- [x] #16340 \n- [x] #16299 \n- [x] #16275 \n- [x] #16265 \n- [x] #16264\n- [x] #16537\n- [x] #16875\n\n## Phase 3: Compatibility testing\n\n- [ ] Work with `typescript-eslint` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/6836))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-import` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2829 https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2873\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-config-airbnb` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic)\n- [x] Work with `eslint-config-standard` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/pull/277)]\n- [x] Work with `eslint-plugin-n` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n/pull/95))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-vue` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/pull/2226))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-react` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/pull/3600))\n- [x] Switch ESLint config to load external configs/plugins without `FlatCompat`\n- [x] Release ESLint with extended compatibility\n\n## Phase 4: General availability (v9.0.0)\n\n- [x] Write blog post about flat config format\n- [x] Output warning when people use `eslintrc` files\n- [x] Switch documentation so `eslint.config.js` is the default and recommended format (link to legacy `eslintrc` docs from the same page)\n- [x] Switch `Linter` to use flat config by default\n- [x] Switch documentation for shareable configs to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] Switch documentation for plugins to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] #14308\n- [x] Rename `ESLint` class to `LegacyESLint` and rename `FlatESLint` to `ESLint`\n- [x] Delete `RuleTester` class and rename `FlatRuleTester` to `RuleTester`\n- [x] Update `api.js` to export new values for `ESLint` and `RuleTester`\n- [x] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to return `true` except if `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` is `false`.\n- [x] Release ESLint with GA flat config\n\n## Phase 5: Remove `eslintrc` (v10.0.0)\n\n- [ ] Remove old CLI flags\n- [ ] Remove `context.parserPath`, `context.parserOptions`, `context.globals` in `Linter` (#20086, eslint/rewrite#263)\n- [ ] Remove `configType` constructor option for `Linter`; throw error if found.\n- [ ] Report an error when `eslint-env` config comment is used (#20128)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` support (#20037)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` documentation\n- [ ] Delete `FlatESLint` class\n- [ ] Delete `LegacyESLint` class\n- [ ] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to always return `true` \n- [ ] Release ESLint without `eslintrc`

It let us override the settings of base configs.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n# .eslintrc.yml\r\nignorePatterns:\r\n  - \"!/node_modules/my-package/\"\r\n  - \"!.eslintrc.js\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI think we should consider it on the flat config system.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport baseConfig from \"my-eslint-config\"\r\nexport default [\r\n  baseConfig, // when it has `ignores: [\"/foo/*\"]`\r\n  {\r\n    ignores: [\r\n      \"!/node_modules/my-package/\", // un-ignore the built-in ignores\r\n      \"!/foo/bar\"                   // un-ignore the base config's ignores\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's confusing with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport baseConfig from \"my-eslint-config\"\r\nexport default [\r\n  baseConfig, // when it has `ignores: [\"/foo/*\"]`\r\n  {\r\n    files: [\"/**/*.js\"],\r\n    ignores: [\r\n      \"!/node_modules/my-package/\", // \r\n      \"!/foo/bar\"                   // what happens?\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a topic that wasn't resolved in \"Config File Simplification\" RFC.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/9#discussion_r433626412 thread, I had tried to describe that the `ignores` setting has two meaning, then argued that it should be separated.\r\n\r\n- If the `files` field exists, the` ignores` field is used for the adoption of the config array element and isn't merged for the ignore check. It's glob patterns as the RFC says. It corresponds to the `files` and `excludedFiles` of legacy configs.\r\n- If the `files` field doesn't exist, the `ignores` field doesn't affect the adoption of the config array element and is merged for the ignore check. It's a list of gitignore-style patterns and supports negative patterns to override base configs.  It corresponds to the `ignorePatterns` of legacy configs and `.eslintignore`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15687/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15194848498,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAKjKDc5TzYBCzwAAAAOJrvzy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/15194848498","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-03T20:30:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15231706050,"node_id":"ATPVTE_lADOAKjKDc5TzYBCzwAAAAOL4WPC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/15231706050","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project_v2","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-03T20:30:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8989043602,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAKjKDc5TzYBCzwAAAAIXyeuS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/8989043602","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-12T19:06:39Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8989043750,"node_id":"LE_lADOAKjKDc5TzYBCzwAAAAIXyewm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/8989043750","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://ap
