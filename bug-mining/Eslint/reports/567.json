I.e. adding a warning callout after the list of rule severities on https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/rules#configuring-rules:\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n> nzakas: Circling back to the docs -- I'm open to a PR so long as we aren't overly prescriptive. I'd rather give a few different scenarios for when warnings are useful rather than nailing down on one.\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\nIs it enough for me to say _see thread_?\r\n\r\nRoughly thinking, perhaps adding a note at the end of https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/rules#rule-severities:\r\n\r\n> In most projects, we recommend using `0`/`warn` only as a temporary measure while enabling a new rule. Using warnings long-term can result in users tuning them out as noise.\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
