(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\n* Moved no-useless-catch from an internal rule to a core rule.\r\n* Made tests more robust for no-useless-catch.\r\n* Added documentation for no-useless-catch.\r\n* no-useless-catch now reports the whole TryStatement node when there is no `finally` clause.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nDouble-checking the type and category of the rule and whether it should be recommended. Also I don't think this is a candidate for the `--fix` option but if people believe it is and could give me pointers on how to implement it I'd be glad to do so.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2029029984,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMjkwMjk5ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2029029984","actor":{"login":"val-grasley","id":11893990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkzOTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11893990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley","html_url":"https://github.com/val-grasley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"866643f65a6ed346db2815decd383b09e02f3027","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/val-grasley/eslint/commits/866643f65a6ed346db2815decd383b09e02f3027","created_at":"2018-12-16T20:55:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/447675288","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11174#issuecomment-447675288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11174","id":447675288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzY3NTI4OA==","user":{"login":"val-grasley","id":11893990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkzOTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11893990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley","html_url":"https://github.com/val-grasley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/val-grasley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-16T20:58:48Z","updated_at":"2018-12-16T20:58:48Z","body":"Okay,
