What about introducing option called `--max-fatal-errors`? This feels somehow consistent with `--max-warnings` option that is already there and won't change behavior unless you use it. \r\n\r\nSample proposal for docs to better describe what I meant:\r\n> \r\n> #### `--max-fatal-errors`\r\n> \r\n> This option allows you to specify a fatal error threshold, which can be used to force ESLint to exit with an error code 3 if there are too many errors in your project that are considered fatal.\r\n> \r\n> Normally, ESLint treats fatal and non-fatal errors in the same way and exits with error code 1 if there is at least one. Error code 1 code indicates that linting was successful but fatal errors are often parsing errors that effectively prevented the linting. Many are caused by misconfigurations and are fixable. This threshold enables ESLint to explicitly warn user with an error message and different exit code.\r\n> \r\n> Example:\r\n> \r\n>     eslint --max-fatal-errors 0 file.js\r\n> \r\n>     file.js\r\n>       1:1  error  Parsing error: The keyword 'import' is reserved\r\n> \r\n>     ✖ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)\r\n> \r\n>     ESLint found too many fatal parsing errors (maximum: 0).\r\n> \r\n\r\nI'll be waiting for the feedback, thank you.
