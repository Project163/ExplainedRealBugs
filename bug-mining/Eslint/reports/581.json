i.e., the project does not have `\"type\": \"module\"` in its `package.json` file), then it isn't possible to use ESM dependencies in `eslint.config.js` because the only way to load ESM from CJS is by using `import()`, but that returns a Promise.\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\nAllow async function configs, as proposed in the RFC:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/main/designs/2019-config-simplification/README.md#function-configs\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/main/designs/2019-config-simplification/README.md#can-a-config-be-an-async-function\r\n \r\nso that ESM dependencies can be used like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// eslint.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = async () => {\r\n\r\n    const someDependency = await import(\"some-esm-dependency\");\r\n\r\n    return [\r\n        // ... use `someDependency` here\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16864/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
