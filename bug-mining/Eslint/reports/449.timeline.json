One could build two type-aware `@typescript-eslint` rules, one to replace the built-in `no-implicit-coercion` rule that doesn't have these false positives and a second `no-redundant-coercion` rule that instead flags these cases as redundant coercions.\r\n\r\nCompletely agree with @btmills, this is something that could be done in [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin) rather than in the core.\r\n\r\n> I'd be fine detecting the explicit `String()` case for consistency with `Number()` since that seems within the rule's purview.\r\n\r\nI marked this issue as accepted to fix this part only, and prepared PR
