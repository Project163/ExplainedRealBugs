### What do you think is the correct solution?\n> In [eslint/rfcs#126](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/126) it was proposed to solve this by adding a new `meta.namespace` key to `Plugin` and have `defineConfig` rewrite the key used to reference a rule in the extended configurations. At least that is how I understood the solution, for more details, see the RFC text.\n\nThis feature is already implemented in `defineConfig`, but doesn't work in your example because `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` doesn't provide the `meta.namespace` property yet. The fix would be to ask that the plugin specify this property.\n\nHere's the typescript-eslint repo:\n\nhttps://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint\n\nWhen the plugin has the `meta.namespace` property specified, we can check whether this works as intended.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2832099942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17416035109,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAKjKDc6z3r0SzwAAAAQOE5sl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/17416035109","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-26T12:22:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2832153363","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19655#issuecomment-2832153363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19655","id":2832153363,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6ozzsT","user":{"login":"niklaswimmer","id":51296580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjk2NTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51296580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/niklaswimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-26T13:16:49Z","updated_at":"2025-04-26T13:16:49Z","body":"I see, I only checked the types defined in the ESlint project and could not find a reference to `namespace`, so I assumed that it is not yet implemented (I may have overseen them though).

Before You File a Proposal Please Confirm You Have Done The Following...\n\n- [x] I have [searched for related issues](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22enhancement%3A+plugin+rule+option%22) and found none that match my proposal.\n- [x] I have searched the [current rule list](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/#rules) and found no rules that match my proposal.\n- [x] I have [read the FAQ](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/troubleshooting) and my problem is not listed.\n\n### Relevant Package\n\neslint-plugin\n\n### My proposal is suitable for this project\n\n- [x] I believe my proposal would be useful to the broader TypeScript community (meaning it is not a niche proposal).\n\n### Description\n\nCurrently, this is an invalid ESLint configuration:\n\n```js\nimport { defineConfig } from \"eslint/config\";\nimport { plugin as ts } from \"typescript-eslint\";\n\nexport default defineConfig(\n    {\n        plugins: {\n            ts,\n        },\n        extends: [\"ts/stylistic\"],\n        rules: {\n            \"ts/array-type\": \"off\",\n        },\n    },\n);\n```\n\nThis does not work as I would intuitively expect: it does not disable the `@typescript-eslint/array-type` rule added by the `ts/stylistic` config. Instead, it disables the `ts/array-type` rule but leaves the `@typescript-eslint/array-type` rule enabled.\n\nESLint recently added the `plugin.meta.namespace` property. A plugin can use this property to specify the namespace it is using for its rule definitions. As far as I understand, the `defineConfig` function will then replace this namespace with the user provided namespace (`ts` in the above example) in all rules of the extended configurations (I think one needs to reference the config via a string, not sure though).\n\nThe end result is that the above config should work as one would intuitively expect, i.e. the `array-type` lint is turned off completely.\n\n### Additional Info\n\nI originally opened this as eslint/eslint#19655 as I thought the whole namespace thing is not yet implemented, but I was told that it is and it is now up to the plugins to support it. Hence this enhancement request.\n\nIf this enhancement is accepted, I should be able to make the change and send a PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/11113/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/11113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2835340423","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19655#issuecomment-2835340423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19655","id":2835340423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6o_9yH","user":{"login":"niklaswimmer","id":51296580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjk2NTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51296580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/niklaswimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklaswimmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-28T13:56:30Z","updated_at":"2025-04-28T13:56:30Z","body":"As suggested, I raised this to the typescript-eslint team.
