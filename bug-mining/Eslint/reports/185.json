The source code couldn't be parsed because it contains a lot of ES2015+ syntax like `const` and `let` since the recent change to Webpack. The Browserify version in `5.14.x` works in IE 11.\r\n\r\nYou can get a step further by changing the Webpack config to also transpile files from `node_modules` (including `.mjs` files apparently) like shown below. This makes sure to transpile to ES5 but I got stuck at this stage because IE still throws the error `Incorrect syntax in regular expression`. Since I saw nothing obvious in the source code I gave up at this point.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrules: [\r\n    {\r\n        test: /\\.m?js$/u,\r\n        loader: \"babel-loader\",\r\n        options: {\r\n            presets: [\"@babel/preset-env\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the question boils down to: What browsers do you intend to support with the browser variant of ESLint?\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\r\nNot at the moment, sorry.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
