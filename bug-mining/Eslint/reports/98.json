There has been some exception to this rule in the past. We accepted Object Rest/Spread when it was at Stage 2, but it was put behind experimental prefix. We also accepted features that are not part of ECMA Script spec at all, like JSX, JSDoc, etc. While we haven't accepted any changes to support decorators, we have modified our rules to not fail when decorators are present.\r\n\r\nThere has been multiple PRs and issues in the past proposing support to new features that we've rejected, however, we have no clear policy that specify what we will accept and what we will not. I think this topic needs clarification so contributors don't waste their time coding support for new feature just to see their PR closed.","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9804/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
