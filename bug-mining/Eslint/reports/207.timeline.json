is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Bug fix: fixes #11510, fixes #11559, fixes #11586\r\n[X] Other, please explain: [the refactoring of configurations](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/42cd563d23eaaad5e9206d8ca7463aeb7dc75a69/designs/2019-eslintrc-improvements/README.md)\r\n\r\nCloses #10928 because I realized that this PR does the same thing as https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/10928#issuecomment-445324188.\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes three bugs along with the refactoring of configurations.\r\nI'm sorry that this diff is huge.\r\n\r\nAll new files are in [`lib/cli-engine/`] directory because only `CLIEngine` uses those.\r\n\r\nThe refactoring does the following items:\r\n\r\n- **It simplifies the internal structure of configuration files by an array.**\r\n    - The internal structure is expressed by the classes in [`lib/cli-engine/config-array/`] directory.\r\n    - [`lib/cli-engine/config-array-factory.js`] creates the internal structure from each config file.\r\n        - [This gist](https://gist.github.com/mysticatea/14deeee23dc44b8d7b650d8b9aedc697) is the config array of [our `.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/c021117915d5d23399233f761a237e138f1854af/.eslintrc.js).\r\n    - [`lib/cli-engine/cascading-config-array-factory.js`] handles cascading of config files and CLI options.\r\n- **The config object owns loaded plugins and parsers rather than registers those to somewhere.**\r\n    - [`lib/cli-engine/config-array/config-array.js`] owns loaded plugins and parsers.\r\n    - [`lib/cli-engine/config-array-factory.js`] loads plugins and parsers.\r\n    - [`Linter#getRules()`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/lib/linter.js#L1121) returns the map that contains built-in rules, user-defined rules (by `Linter#defineRule()`), and plugin rules of `ConfigArray` instance the last `Linter#verify()` call used.\r\n    - [`CLIEngine#getRules()`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/lib/cli-engine.js#L594) returns the map that contains built-in rules and plugin rules of `ConfigArray` instances the last `CLIEngine#executeOnFiles()` or `CLIEngine#executeOnText()` call used.\r\n- **It changes the processing order to \"config-then-files\" from \"files-then-config\".**\r\n    - [`lib/cli-engine/file-enumerator.js`] finds target files by processing glob patterns. While iterating files, it loads the config file of each directory before iterate files on the directory, so we can use the config files to determine target files. (But, it doesn't use the config files to determine target files yet.)\r\n\r\nI describe file mapping of before/after the refactoring. There are details for each new file on the top of the source code.\r\n\r\nOld | New\r\n:----|:----\r\n`lib/config-ops.js`<br>(`merge` method) | [`lib/cli-engine/config-array/config-array.js`]\r\n(n/a) | [`lib/cli-engine/config-array/config-dependency.js`]\r\n(n/a) | [`lib/cli-engine/config-array/extracted-config.js`]\r\n`lib/config-ops.js`<br>(`pathMatchesGlobs` method) | [`lib/cli-engine/config-array/override-tester.js`]\r\n`lib/config.js` | [`lib/cli-engine/cascading-config-array-factory.js`]\r\n`lib/config/config-file.js`<br>`lib/util/file-finder.js` | [`lib/cli-engine/config-array-factory.js`]\r\n`lib/util/glob-utils.js`<br>`lib/util/glob.js` | [`lib/cli-engine/file-enumerator.js`]\r\n\r\nTherefore, appropriate tests to the moved logics are moved to new files. \r\n\r\n- Tests in `tests/lib/config.js` moved to [tests/lib/cli-engine/cascading-config-array-factory.js#L88](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/tests/lib/cli-engine/cascading-config-array-factory.js#L88). It's implemented in the `CascadingConfigArrayFactory#getConfigArrayForFile()` method.\r\n\r\n- Tests for `applyExtends()`, `load()`, and `resolve()` in `tests/lib/config/config-file.js` moved to [tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array-factory.js#L1216](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array-factory.js#L1216). It's implemented in the `ConfigArrayFactory` class.\r\n\r\n- Tests for `load()` and `loadAll()` in `tests/lib/config/plugins.js` moved to [tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array-factory.js#L2031](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array-factory.js#L2031). It's implemented in the `ConfigArrayFactory` class.\r\n\r\n- Tests for `merge()` in `tests/lib/config/config-ops.js` moved to [tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array/config-array.js#L349](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array/config-array.js#L349). It's implemented in the `ConfigArray#extractConfig()` method.\r\n\r\n- Tests for `pathMatchesGlobs()` in `tests/lib/config/config-ops.js` moved to [tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array/override-tester.js#L101](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/tests/lib/cli-engine/config-array/override-tester.js#L101). It's implemented in `OverrideTester#test()` method.\r\n\r\n- Tests for `listFilesToProcess()` in `tests/lib/util/glob-utils.js` moved to [tests/lib/cli-engine/file-enumerator.js#L171](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/tests/lib/cli-engine/file-enumerator.js#L171). It's implemented in the `FileEnumerator#iterateFiles()` method.\r\n\r\n- Tests for `resolveFileGlobPattern()` in `tests/lib/util/glob-utils.js` moved to [tests/lib/cli-engine.js#L3412](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/issue11510/tests/lib/cli-engine.js#L3412). The new `FileEnumerator` no longer uses this logic, but it's a public API of `CLIEngine`. So we have to keep it.\r\n\r\nAnd I added some `@typedef` comments for VSCode IntelliSense.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n- Are there unintentional breaking changes?\r\n\r\nI found an additional breaking change (as a bug fix) about plugin loading. Currently, even if a configuration has no `plugins` field, `CLIEngine#executeOnFiles()` and `CLIEngine#executeOnText()` can use plugin rules that the previous calls loaded. After this PR, `CLIEngine#executeOnFiles()` and `CLIEngine#executeOnText()` will report error messages consistently if plugins were not found in configuration.\r\n\r\nRelated to that, `Linter#getRules()` and `CLIEngine#getRules()` will change:\r\n\r\n- `Linter#getRules()` will return the rules, including built-in rules, user-defined rules, and only the plugin rules that the last `Linter#verify()` loaded.\r\n- `CLIEngine#getRules()` will return the rules, including built-in rules and only the plugin rules that the last `CLIEngine#executeOnFiles()` or `CLIEngine#executeOnText()` loaded.\r\n\r\nI think that this change is good because formatters can access to unrelated rules (via RFC 10) before this PR and we already have a getter to get information of the last `Linter#verify()` call; `Linter#getSourceCode()`.\r\n\r\n[`lib/cli-engine/`]: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/tree/issue11510/lib/cli-engine\r\n[`lib/cli-engine/config-array/`]:

in the latest version of crafty (1.7.1) there is some issue with overriding linting rules, even after running the autofix command:\r\n\r\n`npx crafty jsLint js/**/*.tsx js/**/*.ts --fix`\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we tried:\r\nThe `overrides`  configuration is not taken into account, for all the 3 different ways .  \r\n\r\n**1st way** \r\n\r\n`eslint: {\r\n    rules: {\r\n      \"@swissquote/swissquote/import/prefer-default-export\": \"warn\"\r\n    },\r\n    overrides: {\r\n      files: [\"*.ts\", \"*.tsx\"],\r\n      rules: {\r\n        \"@swissquote/swissquote/@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": [\r\n          \"warn\",\r\n          {args: \"none\", vars: \"local\", ignoreRestSiblings: true}\r\n        ],\r\n        \"@swissquote/swissquote/@typescript-eslint/no-use-before-define\": \"warn\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }`\r\n\r\n**2nd way** \r\n\r\n` eslint: {\r\n    rules: {\r\n      \"@swissquote/swissquote/import/prefer-default-export\": \"warn\",\r\n      \"@swissquote/swissquote/@typescript-eslint/no-use-before-define\": \"warn\"\r\n    }\r\n  },`\r\n\r\n**3rd way**\r\n\r\neslint: {\r\n    rules: {\r\n      \"@swissquote/swissquote/import/prefer-default-export\": \"warn\",\r\n      \"@swissquote/swissquote/@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\": [\r\n

}`\r\n\r\nMaybe a helpful observation: \r\nIn the modules `@swissquote.eslint-plugin-swissquote/index.js` module there is an `overrides` object already hardcoded, so I think there is problem overriding this one.\r\n\r\n
