I suspect a majority of `hasOwnProperty` usages are buggy even if no one has discovered the bug yet, due to the possibility that `hasOwnProperty` can be shadowed in user-provided objects. (`hasOwnProperty` is only useful for objects where the set of keys isn't known at development time, and that's precisely the case where one of the keys could shadow `Object.prototype`.)\r\n\r\nTo me, this is a case where developers can either (a) use a terse notation that is occasionally subtlely wrong, or (b) use a more verbose notation that doesn't have those problems. So my opinion is that always doing (b) is an easy choice, and enforcing against the buggy choice is important for developers who might not be aware of the subtle bug.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/477760253/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/477769882","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10768#issuecomment-477769882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10768","id":477769882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Nzc2OTg4Mg==","user":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T21:02:47Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T21:02:47Z","body":"I'm :+1: to all, though I won't argue too hard for `no-prototype-builtins` if there's not consensus around it. @not-an-aardvark makes a strong argument in my opinion because of the limited scope where `hasOwnProperty` is used. The two mitigating factors that would make me okay with not including it are that first, since it's a called function and not something that could be coerced to a boolean, it's less likely to result in a security vulnerability and more likely just a crash; and second, the use case for using an object as a map is going away now that we have built-in
