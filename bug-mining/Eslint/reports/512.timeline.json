Since ignore v5 has a breaking change, we should probably use it with `{ allowRelativePaths: true }` option to get the v4 behavior that eslintrc might be relying on, as we did in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15439 for eslint/eslint.\r\n\r\nThat update seems a bit risky though, and eslintrc will be replaced by the new config system in the next major release anyway. \r\n\r\n@nzakas what do you think, should we switch to ignore v5.2.0 in `@eslint/eslintrc` and see what happens?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1050929544/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6139699890,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5EkLO-zwAAAAFt9GKy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6139699890","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-25T15:02:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6139699896,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc5EkLO-zwAAAAFt9GK4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6139699896","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-25T15:02:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6139699903,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5EkLO-zwAAAAFt9GK_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6139699903","actor":{"login":"beltekylevi","id":9155943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTU5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9155943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi","html_url":"https://github.com/beltekylevi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beltekylevi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-25T15:02:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6139699910,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc5EkLO-zwAAAAFt9GLG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6139699910
