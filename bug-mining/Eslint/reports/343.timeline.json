I can remember that the AST of `export default function () {}` was `FunctionExpression` at first, but it has been fixed in order to distinguish `export default function f() {}` and `export default (function f() {});`.\r\n\r\nIf now is 2015, it's a bug fix definitely. but now...?\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear the opinion of the rest members of the

think that the following should be also discussed, because the proposed change doesn't treat function declarations in the same way as the rule at the moment treats function expressions when the option is `as-needed`:\r\n\r\n> \"as-needed\" requires function expressions to have a name, if the name cannot be assigned automatically in an ES6 environment\r\n\r\nThe actual code is explicitly treating `export default (function () {})` as an automatically assigned name [in this line](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/329e295ff95cb49c1ab5ea4f3efbbc220307cfbd/lib/rules/func-names.js#L122), and for example this is not an error:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint func-names: [\"error\", \"as-needed\"]*/\r\n\r\nexport default (function () {}) // no error\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this is an error:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint func-names: [\"error\", \"always\"]*/\r\n\r\nexport default (function () {}) // error\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is probably technically correct by the documentation, though if the rule's purpose is to have meaningful names in the stack trace (is this assumption correct? the rule is in the `Stylistic Issues` category) it makes sense to change this as well.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/526819830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/527293268","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12194#issuecomment-527293268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12194","id":527293268,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzI5MzI2OA==","user":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T03:49:24Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T03:49:54Z","body":"Good
