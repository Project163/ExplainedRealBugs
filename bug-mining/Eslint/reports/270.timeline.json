Otherwise, the next release will be in about 2 weeks (close to October 11th). Please see our README for more information.\r\n\r\nA PR would be welcome. I think adding a check for `!node.key` (maybe instead of the `node.type === \"RestProperty\"` check) would probably solve the issue. We would also want a unit test case that uses a mock babel-eslint parser and the generated AST, in order to avoid a regression here. :smile:\r\n\r\nJust as a general reminder for everyone: This project, like most open-source projects, is 100% volunteer-run and the maintainers can only do so much by themselves. I appreciate the great discussion and the quick report of the issue, and I also appreciate everyone's patience as we figure out how best to fix this.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/536307846/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2671255605,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY3MTI1NTYwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2671255605","actor":{"login":"kopax","id":1866564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1866564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax","html_url":"https://github.com/kopax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T14:38:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2671255606,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NzEyNTU2MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2671255606","actor":{"login":"kopax","id":1866564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1866564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax","html_url":"https://github.com/kopax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kopax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T14:38:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/536308347","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12335#issuecomment-536308347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12335","id":536308347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjMwODM0Nw==","user":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-29T14:42:18Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T14:42:18Z","body":"An
