for the proposal. I think your example is actually different from other cases that `no-cond-assign` reports, because it's parsed like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst str = (x = (0 ? 'zero' : 'non-zero'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, the \"condition\" of the ternary isn't the assignment `x = 0`, it's just the constant `0`. So I would expect this to be reported by `no-constant-condition`, not `no-cond-assign`. It appears that `no-constant-condition` is already reporting it with the current implementation.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/374039169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/374632212","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10091#issuecomment-374632212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10091","id":374632212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDYzMjIxMg==","user":{"login":"fvictorio","id":417134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/417134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio","html_url":"https://github.com/fvictorio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvictorio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-20T15:06:04Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T15:06:26Z","body":"You are right, sorry.
