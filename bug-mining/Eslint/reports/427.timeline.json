(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nFixed the `--init` \"upgrade/downgrade ESLint\" prompt to get the expected `answers` object.\r\n\r\nIt used to crash because the argument passed into `message()` was `state`, not `answers`. Thus, `localESLintVersion` and `requiredESLintVersionRange` properties were undefined, and then `semver.ltr(undefined, undefined)` throws.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n* We don't have tests for enquirer prompts and the flow. I tried this fix with ESLint v7.10.0 and `eslint-config-standard` (which requires eslint `^7.12.1`, so an upgrade is needed) and it seems to be working fine.\r\n* `message()` apparently gets `state` as the argument (not `answers`). The fix could have been to get `answers` property from the argument. However, I couldn't find this documented, so decided to use `this.state.answers`, like in the rest of the code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13995/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4212267068,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDIxMjI2NzA2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/4212267068","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-15T17:49:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4212267254,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyMTIyNjcyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/4212267254","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"179a910b32e853bc12a9dd71f7c10e762cbeac44","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/179a910b32e853bc12a9dd71f7c10e762cbeac44","created_at":"2021-01-15T17:49:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-05T23:35:07Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T23:35:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jLouzado/framework-fatigue/issues/31","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jLouzado/framework-fatigue","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jLouzado/framework-fatigue/issues/31/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jLouzado/framework-fatigue/issues/31/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jLouzado/framework-fatigue/issues/31/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jLouzado/framework-fatigue/pull/31","id":823492051,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTg1OTQyNzM0","number":31,"title":"Bump
