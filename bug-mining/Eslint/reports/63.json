From what I can tell, the reasoning for the decision was that users might not expect ESLint to inform them that their files are empty.\r\n\r\nIn the 3 years since that decision was made, a few things about ESLint have changed:\r\n\r\n* We've introduced whitespace-only rules like `no-trailing-spaces`, which would have a well-defined and useful behavior for files that only contain whitespace.\r\n* Many more people now write custom rules, and they frequently use `RuleTester` to test their rules. A whitespace-only string is occasionally used to test that a rule works correctly when a program contains nothing of interest. However, since `Linter` ignores empty strings, any \"valid\" test on a whitespace-only string does not run the tested rule at all. This is usually unexpected for rule developers. Case in point: We have 15 buggy tests in the ESLint codebase ([1](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L23), [2](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L24), [3](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L39), [4](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L29), [5](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L40), [6](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L46), [7](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L47), [8](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/eol-last.js#L48), [9](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/indent-legacy.js#L286-L290), [10](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/indent.js#L304-L307), [11](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/max-len.js#L170), [12](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/no-trailing-spaces.js#L37-L40), [13](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/no-trailing-spaces.js#L41-L44), [14](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/no-unused-vars.js#L108), [15](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b491e0ee87a10a580e707a753fdf23ac585ab9/tests/lib/rules/nonblock-statement-body-position.js#L151-L154)) where the test author incorrectly assumed a test was making an assertion about a rule, when it actually was not. In my view, this is undesirable because ESLint could unexpectedly conceal rule logic errors, leading to potential bugs.\r\n* We have many more people using ESLint's Node.js API than we used to, so I think it's important that the API remains intuitively consistent to avoid unexpected conditions in integrations. I think it's unexpected that `Linter#verify` runs rules on almost all strings that get passed to it, but it does not run rules when a string happens to only contain whitespace. This seems like it would lead to unanticipated edge cases for API users.\r\n\r\nDue to these issues, I think the current behavior on whitespace-only files is actually more unexpected than the alternative. I think we should remove this special case and have ESLint treat whitespace-only strings the same way it treats other text.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9534/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
