That's by design from the start (#3232 and #3260). It simply searches for all ternary expressions where test and consequent are same identifier.\r\n\r\nIncorrect parts of the documentation are:\r\n\r\n1. The `incorrect` example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint no-unneeded-ternary: \"error\"*/\r\n\r\nvar a = x === 2 ? true : false;\r\n\r\nvar a = x ? true : false;\r\n\r\nvar a = f(x ? x : 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example is wrong, `var a = f(x ? x : 1);` is not a warning because of the default option value.\r\n\r\n2. The `correct` example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint no-unneeded-ternary: \"error\"*/\r\n\r\nvar a = x === 2 ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\r\n\r\nvar a = x !== false;\r\n\r\nvar a = x ? \"Yes\" : \"No\";\r\n\r\nvar a = x ? y : x;\r\n\r\nvar a = x ? x : 1;  // Note that this is only allowed as it on the right hand side of an assignment; this type of ternary is disallowed everywhere else. See defaultAssignment option below for more details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe comment is wrong.\r\n\r\n3. defaultAssignment section\r\n\r\n> The defaultAssignment option allows expressions of the form x ? x : expr (where x is any identifier and expr is any expression) as the right hand side of assignments (but nowhere else).\r\n\r\nThe option (when `true`) allows such expressions everywhere.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nFix the documentation.\r\n\r\n~~Perhaps also consider changing the name of the option for two reasons:~~\r\n\r\n* ~~The `Assignment` part is confusing.~~\r\n* ~~When the option name doesn't have an explicit prefix, `true` ususally means \"enforce on\", rather than \"allow\".~~\r\n\r\n~~Maybe `allowSameConsequent` or `allowSameIfTrue`.~~\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes, I would be glad to do it.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12098/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12098/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
