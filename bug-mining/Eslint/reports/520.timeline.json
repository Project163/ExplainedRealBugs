What rule do you want to change?\n\nobject-curly-spacing\n\n### What change to do you want to make?\n\nGenerate fewer warnings\n\n### How do you think the change should be implemented?\n\nA new option\n\n### Example code\n\n```js\nimport { name } from './modules/square.js';\r\n\r\nlet x = {greeting: name};\n```\n\n\n### What does the rule currently do for this code?\n\nGenerates a warning of one sort or another, either for { name } or for {greeting: name}, depending on which way the string option is set.\n\n### What will the rule do after it's changed?\n\nNot generate a warning if the object option is set to expect this combination.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request to implement this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nThe example is parts of two MDN tutorial examples, one for modules and one for object initializers. It seems like Mozilla's style guide considers braces around lists of names more like blocks and less like object destructuring (note that it also would have block-spacing: always, based on other examples).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the right way to set up option(s) for this is, given that the variation between style guides seems to be in which of two rules applies to some syntax. I think just having a \"moduleDeclarations\": boolean option here would be sufficient, without getting into what style guide is matching instead of usual objects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1073177886","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15710#issuecomment-1073177886","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15710","id":1073177886,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc4_92Ue","user":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-20T06:26:55Z","updated_at":"2022-03-20T06:26:55Z","body":"The whole point of `no-use-before-define` is that you don't reference things before they're defined, whether it's for exporting or anything else.\r\n\r\nMy stylistic preference is that exports, like returns, should go at the end of the relevant section of code.
