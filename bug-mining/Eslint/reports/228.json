By default, the minimum number of keys would be 2.\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented? (New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\nNew option -- I'm thinking `minKeys` is consistent with the naming of other options throughout ESLint, but happy to hear other suggestions. \r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint sort-keys: [\"error\", { minKeys: 5 }] */\r\n\r\nconst styles = {\r\n  position: 'relative',\r\n  color: 'blue'\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst styles2 = {\r\n  fontSize: 16,\r\n  position: 'relative',\r\n  color: 'blue',\r\n  zIndex: 10,\r\n  display: 'block',\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\nESLint produces 3 errors, one error for the property ordering of `styles` and two errors for the property ordering of `styles2`.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nWith `minKeys` set to 5, only `styles2` will produce lint errors, so there will be a total of 2 lint errors.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nYes, happy to open a PR if the proposal reaches consensus","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11624/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11624/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
