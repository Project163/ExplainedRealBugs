}`\r\n\r\nThere is no `await`, but what the `async` does here is guarantee a `Promise`.  So the following code will return `got`.\r\n\r\n`test().catch(function (e) { console.log(\"got\"); })`\r\n\r\nTake away the `async` and the above code is going to fail big time  Now if you can guarantee you are always going to call test with `await`, you are ok again as `await` will check if it's a `Promise`, but if you sent this to any other other Promise based consumers you have the above issue.\r\n\r\nI'm mainly pointing this out as the Doc's say nothing of this issue, and could potential cause hard to debug issues for people who are currently mixing Promise & async / await.  So I wonder if a big warning of this potential pitfall should be put in the Doc's.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9540/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
