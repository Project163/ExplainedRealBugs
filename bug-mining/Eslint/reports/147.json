However, the `version` property appears in different places; it's placed on `CLIEngine` directly, but it's placed on *instances* of `Linter`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst eslint = require(\"eslint\");\r\n\r\neslint.CLIEngine.version // 4.6.1\r\neslint.Linter.version // undefined\r\n\r\nnew eslint.CLIEngine().version // undefined\r\nnew eslint.Linter().version // 4.6.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happened because the `version` property was added when `Linter` was a singleton rather than a constructor, so users were previously expected to access `eslint.linter.version`.\r\n\r\nThis could be mildly annoying; for example, an integration that only has access to `Linter` (like https://eslint.org/demo) would need to create a throwaway instance of `Linter` to get the version.\r\n\r\nI propose that we add `version` as a static property of `Linter`. We could also copy it to `Linter.prototype` to prevent integrations from breaking if they were checking for the `version` property on instances.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9271/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9271/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
