happen?\n\nI'd expect the `Array` variable not to be in `GlobalScope#implicit` since ESLint adds it as a predefined global variable.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\n```\nArray variable is in the global scope? true\nArray variable references in the global scope: Array(1:1), Array(3:1)\nArray variable is in GlobalScope#implicit? true\nGlobalScope#implicit.left: Array(1:1), Array(3:1)\n```\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-2uhwupap?file=index.js\n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull
