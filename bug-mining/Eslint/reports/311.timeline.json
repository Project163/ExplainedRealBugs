A workaround that users can do today is to run eslint from a higher scope than the folder with the `package.json` that contains `\"type\": \"module\"`. For example, if your project is in `/app`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n/app/.eslintrc.js\r\n/app/package.json      # Main package.json for app, with \"name\", \"main\", \"dependencies\", etc.\r\n/app/src/package.json  # Just { \"type\": \"module\" }\r\n/app/src/...           # Rest of app in here\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `/app/package.json` either wouldn’t have a `\"type\"` field or would have `\"type\": \"commonjs\"`, `.eslintrc.js` would be loaded fine as CommonJS. And since `/app/src/package.json` would have `\"type\": \"module\"`, all the `.js` files under `/app/src/` would be loaded as ESM.\r\n\r\nPresumably many projects using ES module syntax today already have their code in a subfolder like `src`, so simply adding a `src/package.json` that contains `\"type\": \"module\"` is all such users need to do. This additional `package.json` file doesn’t need any other keys—no `\"name\"`, `\"main\"`, `\"dependencies\"` or anything else.\r\n\r\nObviously it’s more ideal to have only one `package.json` rather than two, but this workaround should work for any tool with this same issue, until all such tools are updated to support `.toolnamerc.cjs` or using `import()` to load `.toolnamerc.js` inside a `\"type\": \"module\"` scope.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/535799024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GeoffreyBooth","id":456802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjgwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth","html_url":"https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeoffreyBooth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2667490770,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY2NzQ5MDc3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2667490770","actor":{"login":"guybedford","id":598730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODczMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford","html_url":"https://github.com/guybedford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-27T05:57:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2667490772,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2Njc0OTA3NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2667490772","actor":{"login":"guybedford","id":598730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODczMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford","html_url":"https://github.com/guybedford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guybedford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-27T05:57:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/535980113","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12319#issuecomment-535980113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12319","id":535980113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTk4MDExMw==","user":{"login":"hybrist","id":567540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzU0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist","html_url":"https://github.com/hybrist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybrist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T15:09:13Z

I understand that philosophy as applying to \"Code being linted/processed\". We have features like `env` and shareable config to make files from certain environments easier to lint, but ESLint is fundamentally agnostic of the runtime environment as much as possible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, ESLint itself runs on Node.js. That is a specific decision we made-- we don't run(*) on browsers, RhinoJS, or other runtimes. We are a Node package.\r\n\r\nSo, for an issue like this that is about the execution of ESLint from Node, I think we need to follow Node.js's lead as much as we reasonably can and try to support different Node module styles, within reason. (This is *not* the same as saying we need to make ESLint async so it can be imported as an ES module itself.)\r\n\r\nSo based on that, if .cjs is official/not experimental (or will be very soon), I think we need to support it by allowing `.eslintrc.cjs` (and have it work the same as our current `.js` config implementation).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n(*) Okay, we have webpack/browserify which creates a browser implementation, but that is not officially supported.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/542328055/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2804202207,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgwNDIwMjIwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2804202207","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-15T22:43:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2804202226,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4MDQyMDIyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2804202226","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-15T22:43:56Z","label":{"name":"auto closed","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
