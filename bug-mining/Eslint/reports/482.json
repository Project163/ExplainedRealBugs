I had to set \"this\" and \"new\" to before: false, because I don't want a space between casting angle brackets `<Thing>this.blah` or `<Thing>new Blah()`.\r\nAnd I was happy when it seemed to work in almost all cases. Obviously I'm using `this.blah` in thousands of places, very commonly with spaces in front, and almost all of them work. The only exception is the \"greater than\" symbol, used for comparisons. Less than (and everything else) seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nSo given it only gives an error with the exact combination `> this` I feel like it's a bug.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\nNo errors\r\n\r\n**What actually happened?
