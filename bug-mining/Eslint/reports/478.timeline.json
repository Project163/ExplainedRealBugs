Environment\n\nNode version: v14.17.4\r\nnpm version: 6.14.14\r\nLocal ESLint version: 7.32.0\r\nGlobal ESLint version: n/a\r\nOperating System: macOS 11.6 (20G165)\r\n\n\n### What parser are you using?\n\nDefault (Espree)\n\n### What did you do?\n\nI created a new project and installed eslint using these options:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx eslint --init\r\n✔ How would you like to use ESLint? · style\r\n✔ What type of modules does your project use? · esm\r\n✔ Which framework does your project use? · vue\r\n✔ Does your project use TypeScript? · No / Yes\r\n✔ Where does your code run? · browser\r\n✔ How would you like to define a style for your project? · guide\r\n✔ Which style guide do you want to follow? · standard\r\n✔ What format do you want your config file to be in? · JavaScript\r\nChecking peerDependencies of eslint-config-standard@latest\r\nThe config that you've selected requires the following dependencies:\r\n\r\neslint-plugin-vue@latest eslint-config-standard@latest eslint@^7.12.1 eslint-plugin-import@^2.22.1 eslint-plugin-node@^11.1.0 eslint-plugin-promise@^4.2.1 || ^5.0.0\r\n✔ Would you like to install them now with npm? · Yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich resulted in this config file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  env: {\r\n    browser: true,\r\n    es2021: true\r\n  },\r\n  extends: [\r\n    'plugin:vue/essential',\r\n    'standard'\r\n  ],\r\n  parserOptions: {\r\n    ecmaVersion: 13,\r\n    sourceType: 'module'\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    'vue'\r\n  ],\r\n  rules: {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that it has `es2021: true` but `ecmaVersion: 13` which doesn't seem right.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI expect eslint to work\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nI am getting the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/temp/.eslintrc.js\r\n  0:0  error  Parsing error: Invalid ecmaVersion\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nIf I change the `ecmaVersion` from 13 to 12 it works. This makes sense since ecmascript 2021 is actually version 12.\r\n\r\nIs this a config creation
