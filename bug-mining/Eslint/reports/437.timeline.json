rule do you want to change?**\r\n\r\n[no-sequences](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-sequences)\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #14197 (Add option to disable the \"in-parentheses\" exception).\r\nConsequently, the rule should contain an option to decide whether commas are allowed in for-loop heads.\r\n\r\n**Does this change cause the rule to produce more or fewer warnings?**\r\n\r\nMore.\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented? (New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nCurrently, comma expressions are always allowed in for-loop `init` and `update` part, but not in `test` part where it does not make any sense.\r\n\r\nI have two alternatives in mind:\r\n\r\n1. One option for init and update part of the for-loop, e.g. \"allowInForLoop\". But this is confusing as it obfuscates the fact that comma will still not be allowed in `test` part.\r\n2. Distinct options for `init` and `update` part:\r\n   - `allowForLoopInit` (following \"ignoreForLoopInit\" from [init-declarations](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/init-declarations))\r\n   - `allowForLoopAfterthoughts` (as in [no-plusplus](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-plusplus)) (or `allowForLoopUpdate` which is shorter and better remarkable?)\r\n\r\nAll options will be `true` by default for compatibility.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet i, j;\r\nfor (i = 0, j = 0; i < 100; i += 1, j += 2) {\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nPasses.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\nPass or warn according to options.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/797258521","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14197#issuecomment-797258521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14197","id":797258521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NzI1ODUyMQ==","user":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-12T06:05:31Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T06:05:31Z","body":"@danielrentz
