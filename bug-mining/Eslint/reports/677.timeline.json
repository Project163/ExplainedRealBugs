it will allow string identifiers for configs contained in plugins as well as objects\n\nMy 2c - disallow this.\n\nFlat configs went a long way to making configs \"just javascript\" and less magical. Allowing string references to plugin definitions would be bringing back a magical thing.\n\nIt's also a difficult / impossible thing to statically analyse for to help catch bad code ahead of the lint run. For example right now it's very easy to use TS to sanity check the config and catch typos like `js.configs.reccomended` - but it wouldn't be really possible to do the same for a dynamic string.\n\nAdditionally many plugins have intentionally not shipped flat configs via their `plugin` object and instead only make them available via import paths. They did this to make the backwards-compatibility story easier. So allowing string references would create a weird disjoint in the ecosystem that these plugins couldn't be used with.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2463169424/reactions","total_count":26,"+1":22,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradzacher","id":7462525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjI1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7462525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher","html_url":"https://github.com/bradzacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2463173790","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19116#issuecomment-2463173790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19116","id":2463173790,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6S0Qye","user":{"login":"bradzacher","id":7462525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjI1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7462525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher","html_url":"https://github.com/bradzacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-07T20:42:31Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T20:43:41Z","body":"It's worth noting that we already have extends in the flat config ecosystem in userland via the  `tseslint.config` utility:\n\nhttps://typescript-eslint.io/packages/typescript-eslint#flat-config-extends\n\nMany people love it and rely on it to simplify their configuration.

Users are complaining that there are too many ways to mix and match configs. This would help shepherd towards a more consistent approach.

One of my mistakes gave me a possible idea for `extends`.\n\nThis is what I tried:\n\n```ts\nexport default tseslint.config({\n  files: [\"**/*.ts\"],\n  extends: [...storybookPlugin.configs[\"flat/recommended\"]],\n});\n```\n\nUnfortunately `tseslint.config` overwrites each shared config's `files`, causing rules to apply too widely:\n\n```ts\nexport default [\n  {\n    name: \"storybook:recommended:stories-rules\",\n    files: [\"**/*.ts\"],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nI could imagine an ESLint `extends` normalizing to this instead, where files must match **any** pattern in **every** array:\n\n```ts\nexport default [\n  {\n    name: \"storybook:recommended:stories-rules\",\n    files: [[\"**/*.ts\"], [\"**/*.stories.*\", \"**/*.story.*\"]],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nBetween this and allowing nested configs, I think you could solve most of the pain points people are having right now.\n\nIt's worth noting `files` already supports `string[][]`, but its utility is limited because the any/all logic is reversed. It's currently slated for removal in v10 (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18966), and maybe that makes room for something like this.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2473574008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aaronadamsCA","id":1505561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1505561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronadamsCA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronadamsCA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15283124634,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc6desUkzwAAAAOO8fma","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/15283124634","actor":{"login":"pete-willard","id":3645737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDU3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3645737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard","html_url":"https://github.com/pete-willard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pete-willard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-13T13:24:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2473948656","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19116#issuecomment-2473948656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19116","id":2473948656,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6TdXXw","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-13T15:28:21Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T15:28:21Z","body":"@bradzacher @aladdin-add I think this is all good feedback, but it's better to wait for an RFC to discuss things in this much detail.
