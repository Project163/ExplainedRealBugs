The same applies to [Array.prototype.lastIndexOf](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.lastindexof).\r\n\r\n**Does this change cause the rule to produce more or fewer warnings?**\r\n\r\nMore if an option is set to `true`. Defaults are `false`.\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented? (New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\n2 options, `enforceForSwitchCase` and `enforceForIndexOf`.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint use-isnan: \"error\"*/\r\n\r\nswitch (foo) {\r\n    case NaN:\r\n        bar();\r\n        break;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfoo.indexOf(NaN);\r\nfoo.lastIndexOf(NaN);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint use-isnan: [\"error\", {\"enforceForSwitchCase\": true}]*/\r\n\r\nswitch (foo) {\r\n    case NaN: // error\r\n        bar();\r\n        break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint use-isnan: [\"error\", {\"enforceForIndexOf\": true}]*/\r\n\r\nfoo.indexOf(NaN); // error\r\nfoo.lastIndexOf(NaN); // error\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes. (there is PR #12106 for `enforceForSwitchCase`)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12207/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
