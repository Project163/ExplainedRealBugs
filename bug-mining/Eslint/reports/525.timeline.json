(Give an overview)\r\n\r\n* Merged `validateCommaItemSpacing` into the loop in `\"Program:exit\"()` because the logic of what to check and what to ignore was unnecessarily scattered.\r\n* Removed `JSXText` check. We are checking if it's a comma punctuator token just a line before, so it can't be JSXText.\r\n* Added new checks for `]` and `}`.\r\n* Updated the docs accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nI also wanted to replace `addNullElementsToIgnoreList` and all related code with a simple `[` token check, but it turned out that the existing logic has possibly unintentional side effects of ignoring spacing between a comment and ending comma of a hole/elision.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004
