`switch-colon-spacing` looks more specific for this code, we should probably update `space-before-blocks` to ignore blocks in this position.

If updating `space-before-blocks` to ignore these blocks looks like the right solution, shall we plan that change for ESLint

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nUpdated `space-before-blocks` to ignore spacing after switch case colons, because that conflicts with `switch-colon-spacing`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nI marked this as \"Update\" although this change can produce only fewer warnings, because it changes the functionality of this rule while this wasn't a bug in the rule itself.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5354795254,"node_id":"CE_lADOAKjKDc47nk3VzwAAAAE_K7D2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/5354795254","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-24T09:06:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5354795534,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc47nk3VzwAAAAE_K7IO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/5354795534","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cf34e5cf5ed5d09eb53c16cca06821c4e34b7b70","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/cf34e5cf5ed5d09eb53c16cca06821c4e34b7b70","created_at":"2021-09-24T09:06:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sync-by-unito[bot]","id":65029690,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NjUwMjk2OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/64202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/sync-by-unito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync-by-unito%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-01T22:41:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T22:41:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/numbersprotocol/capture-cam/issues/1029","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/numbersprotocol/capture-cam","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/numbersprotocol/capture-cam/issues/1029/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/numbersprotocol/capture-cam/issues/1029/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/numbersprotocol/capture-cam/issues/1029/events","html_url":"https://github.com/numbersprotocol/capture-cam/pull/1029","id":1041465416,"node_id":"PR_kwDOD_-hQc4t8Rhy","number":1029,"title":"build(deps-dev):
