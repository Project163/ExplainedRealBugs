This command causes an error due to incorrect syntax when using the `@latest` tag.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nThe correct command should be `yarn create @eslint/config` without the `@latest` tag. This prevents errors and ensures smooth execution of the command.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n| Command | Output |\r\n|---------|--------|\r\n| `yarn create @eslint/config@latest` |  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4afaf56-4296-4dad-9484-fe963bc1968b)|\r\n| `yarn create @eslint/config` | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3d682bb-1852-43ec-9097-4d70f1c8ee7b)  |\r\n\r\nMaking this change will help users avoid unnecessary errors when setting up ESLint with yarn.","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
