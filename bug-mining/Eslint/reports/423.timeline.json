Changes proposed in this Pull Request\r\n\r\n* Enables estline rule [`one-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/one-var). It forbids patterns like:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    let var1, var2;\r\n    ``` \r\n    \r\n    and autofix them to\r\n    ```\r\n    let var1;\r\n    let var2;\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n* Apply `one-var` autofix across the codebase.\r\n* Run `prettier` in affected files.\r\n* Manually fix https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/pull/47310/files#diff-3ec97767860a9c864e12180449bc1777637d3861ece2fd2139fd12f335516c01 because it hit the bug https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13834\r\n\r\nAfter applying this rule it should be easier to autofix [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var) and [`prefer-const`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n* Ignore code style errors, there will be a ton.\r\n* This change should be safe, nothing to test. If the test are green it means that the app can be compiled and therefore the autofix didn't include any syntax
