(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nI removed `globby` and replaced it with a custom solution built upon `@nodelib/fs.walk`, which was used by `fast-glob` to walk the directory and look for matching filenames. Instead of forcing `globby` to reinterpret ignores, this solution uses `FlatConfigArray#isFileIgnored()` as part of the traversal so it exactly mirrors the ignoring behavior inside of a config array. This should fix a lot of the outstanding issues related to ignoring certain files.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nIf you've seen weird behavior, please check out this branch and try it out to see if it fixes the issue. I'm still adding tests to this PR to make sure everything is fixed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I marked as \"feat\" because it seemed worthy of a minor release, but totally fine to mark as \"fix\" if others feel differently.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004 -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16369/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1265894387","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16354#issuecomment-1265894387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16354","id":1265894387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5LdAPz","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-03T18:58:41Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T18:58:41Z","body":"> Since config `ignores` patterns match files (not directories), the `foo/bar/a.js` file should be linted.\r\n\r\nThis is an incorrect assumption. `ignores` in config files will match both directories and files, just like `.eslintignore` or `.gitignore`.
