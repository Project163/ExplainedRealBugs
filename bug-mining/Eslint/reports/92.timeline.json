(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis is related to https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9662.\r\nCurrently, when a parser, such as `babel-eslint` is used, it'll now return `JSXFragment`. This PR updates some standard rules to add some support for fragments so that `JSXFragment`s can generally be used in the place of `JSXElement`.\r\n\r\n**Current behavior example**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<>foo</>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwarns that foo should be wrapped in quotes, using the options:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"parser\": \"babel-eslint\",\r\n\"rules\": { \"quotes\": [ \"error\", \"single\" ] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Behavior with my changes**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<>foo</>;\r\n```\r\n\r\ndoesn't give any warnings!\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\nI'm just throwing this out here because I'm not really sure if this is a change makes sense to make in this repo at this point in time. This is only applicable when an external parser is specified. If this makes sense, then I can refine the PR. 🙂

#46\r\n\r\nThis adds support for using the new React Fragments `<></>`. \r\nHowever: `plugin-transform-react-jsx` only supports them from babel v7 and on, which has no moved to `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`, which requires `@babel/core`, which would mean `@babel/register` should be used instead of `babel-register`. Again, in order to use babel 7, ava had to be bumped to use the new `1.0.0-beta` versions. \r\n\r\nCoulnd't get xo to play nice with the fragments. I kept getting this error:\r\n```\r\ntest/components.js:672:6\r\n  ✖  672:6  Parsing error: Unexpected token >  \r\n```\r\nMaybe @sindresorhus can help me figure out how to get xo to recognize them.\r\n\r\nThis would also mean that every package that uses ink, should also upgrade to the new babel versions. \r\n\r\nA less invasive way of introducing fragments would be to ommit the shorthand `<></>` syntax and jsut add a `<Fragment></Fragment>` component which would basically be a `span`. That wouldn't require any new package versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vadimdemedes/ink/issues/70/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vadimdemedes/ink/issues/70/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"EECOLOR","id":1486362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1486362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR","html_url":"https://github.com/EECOLOR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EECOLOR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-09T12:08:31Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T12:08:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kaliberjs/build/issues/103","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kaliberjs/build","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kaliberjs/build/issues/103/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kaliberjs/build/issues/103/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kaliberjs/build/issues/103/events","html_url":"https://github.com/kaliberjs/build/issues/103","id":278286473,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzgyODY0NzM=","number":103,"title":"eslint
