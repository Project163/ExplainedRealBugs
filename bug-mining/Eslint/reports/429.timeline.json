Promise.resolve(1)\r\n    : Promise.resolve(2)\r\n  : Promise.resolve(3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the condition was mostly copied from the condition that @sheerun had included for the alternate in PR #12556 (bb6cf5082623ffb67bb1495fee52c0610ee5f421).\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nI hope there is enough information in issue #13971 to explain the issue and in this PR to understand the solution. I would be happy to add some more test cases and documentation updates if needed.\r\n\r\nThis PR can help unblock the following issues and updates in some other projects:\r\n\r\n-
