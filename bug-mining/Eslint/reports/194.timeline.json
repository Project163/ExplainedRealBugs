discussions include: #3458, #10125)\r\n\r\n# Background/Problem description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ESLint plugins and shareable configs are loaded from the location of the ESLint package, rather than the location of the config file where the plugins and configs are referenced. This leads to several problems:\r\n\r\n* The current behavior requires end users to manually install any plugins required by a shareable config. As a result, a shareable config can't add a plugin without requiring new manual installation steps from the end user. This greatly degrades the ergonomics of using custom rules from plugins in shareable configs, and results in increased pressure to add new rules and options to ESLint core.\r\n* The current behavior assumes that if a user installs a config/plugin and ESLint in the same project, then ESLint will be able to load that config/plugin. This relies on an implementation detail of how npm works rather than a specified behavior, which leads to problems when using other package management strategies, e.g. with `lerna`. (More details about this problem can be found in [#10125](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10125).)\r\n* The current behavior leads to a large amount of confusion from users where ESLint behaves differently depending on whether it's installed \"globally\" with npm.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, many users have proposed loading all configs and plugins from the location of the config that depends on them (e.g. see #3458). For example, if a config has a field like `plugins: react`, ESLint would load `eslint-plugin-react` from the location of the config file itself. This would be beneficial because it would allow the author of a shareable config to control its dependencies, rather than the end user. It would also have a side-effect of removing the behavior change between local and global ESLint installations, which is a frequent source of confusion for users.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, implementing this scheme as-is would cause naming ambiguity. There could be two shareable configs which have dependencies on two different plugins that both happen to be called `react` (or they depend on two different versions of a plugin called `react`). If the end user depended on these two shareable configs and also configured a rule like `react/some-rule` in their top-level config, the end user's config would be ambiguous because it wouldn't be clear which `react` plugin they were referring to. Since the configurations for a given rule might be incompatible across different versions of a plugin, this could make it impossible to set the configuration for a particular rule or to override a configuration which was set by a shareable config. This would be an unacceptably poor user experience.\r\n\r\nAnother way to state the problem is that ESLint's mechanism for naming rules in a config file (`plugin-name/rule-name`) is fundamentally unable to disambiguate two plugins that have the same name. Currently, there are no naming conflicts because all plugins are loaded from the location of the `eslint` package, so plugins effectively live in a global namespace. If plugins could be loaded as dependencies of shareable configs, then naming conflicts would start to become a problem. As a result, we need to be able to support having two plugins with the same name before we can support having plugins as dependencies of configs.\r\n\r\n# Design goals of solution\r\n\r\n* A config author should be able to add or upgrade any plugin in their config, without requiring additional installation steps from end users that extend that config.\r\n* The end user should maintain the ability to override any configuration setting inherited from an extended config.\r\n* A config author should be able to extend any two other configs at the same time, and have ESLint lint their code successfully. (The two configs might advocate mutually-incompatible code styles, but that issue is out of scope for this proposal.)\r\n* ESLint's config-loading behavior should be compatible with the use of any package manager that follows the de-facto `package.json` spec, without relying on the implementation details of any particular package manager.\r\n* Standalone config files should continue to be usable as shareable configs, and vice versa, without any changes.\r\n* Shareable configs which currently have plugins as `peerDependencies` should be able to transition to the new solution without requiring changes to the configs of their users (or at least the vast majority of their users).\r\n* The vast majority of existing configs in local-installation setups should continue to work with the new solution.\r\n\r\n# Summary of proposed solution\r\n\r\nSince the problem stems from a limitation of ESLint's naming scheme, I think the most straightforward solution to the problem would involve changing the way that rules are named in a config file. Specifically, this solution proposes using hierarchical naming for rules, where rules would be configured with something that looks like a path. (In other words, a user could refer to a rule like `foo::react/some-rule` for the version of `eslint-plugin-react` used by `eslint-config-foo`, and this would be a different rule than `bar::react/some-rule`, which would refer to the version of `eslint-plugin-react` used by `eslint-config-bar`.)\r\n\r\nThis is similar to a few other proposals discussed in #3458, but I've done a significant amount of work since then on precisely describing the behavior, figuring out the edge cases, and thinking through alternatives.\r\n\r\n# Details of proposed solution\r\n\r\nWhen describing how rule name resolution works in this proposal, it's useful to think of a \"config tree\" representing the dependencies between shareable configs and plugins. The root node is the end user's config, and each node has a set of named children representing the shareable configs that it extends and plugins that it depends on. Here's an example tree:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/8ae08a222010b063b636543e83d3590d.png)\r\n\r\nIn this example, the end user's config extends `eslint-config-foo` and `eslint-config-bar`. `eslint-config-bar` extends `eslint-config-baz`. `eslint-config-foo` and `eslint-config-baz` both depend on versions of `eslint-plugin-react` (perhaps different versions, although this doesn't matter as far as resolution is concerned). `eslint-config-baz` also depends on `eslint-plugin-import`. \r\n\r\n## Rule name resolution\r\n\r\n* Each reference to a plugin rule in a config consists of three parts: a *config scope* (i.e. a list of configs), a plugin name, and a rule name.\r\n    * For example, in an existing rule configuration like `react/no-typos`, the config scope is an empty list, the plugin name is `react`, and the rule name is `no-typos`. (In existing rule configurations, the config scope is always an empty list.)\r\n    * In a rule configuration like `foo::bar::react/no-typos`, the config scope is `['foo', 'bar']`, the plugin name is `react`, and the rule name is `no-typos`.\r\n    * The syntax shown here for writing a config scope (which uses `::` as a separator) is up for bikeshedding. For now, I would recommend focusing on the abstract idea of a `(configScope, pluginName, ruleName)` triple; the question of how best to syntactically represent that can be decided independently of the rest of the proposal.\r\n* Each reference to a plugin rule is also implicitly associated with a config in the config tree. References that appear in a config file are associated with that config file. References outside of a config file (e.g. from the command line or inline config comments) are associated with the root of the config tree.\r\n\r\nTo resolve a `(configScope, pluginName, ruleName)` triple to a loaded rule, which is referenced in a config `baseConfig`:\r\n\r\n* If `configScope` is non-empty, find the child config of `baseConfig` in the config tree which has a name of `configScope[0]`, and recursively resolve the rule `(configScope.slice(1), pluginName, ruleName)` from that config.\r\n    * (If there is no such child config, the rule reference is invalid. ESLint should exit with a useful error message.)\r\n* Otherwise, if `configScope` is empty:\r\n    * If `baseConfig` has a direct child plugin with the name `pluginName`, or `baseConfig` is a plugin config from a plugin called `pluginName`, return the rule called `ruleName` from that plugin.\r\n    * Otherwise, search for all plugins that are descendants of `baseConfig` in the config tree and have a name of `pluginName`.\r\n        * If there is exactly one such plugin, return the rule called `ruleName` from that plugin.\r\n        * If there are no such plugins, the rule reference is invalid. ESLint should exit with a useful error message.\r\n        * If there is more than one such plugin, the rule reference is ambiguous. ESLint should exit with useful error message.\r\n            * For example, this error message could include all of the matching plugins that were found, and provide a replacement rule reference that would disambiguate each of them. The user could the choose one of the replacements and copy-paste it into their config. This would make it simple for the user to resolve an ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few examples of this config resolution strategy, with the config tree given above (reproduced below for convenience):\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Example config tree (same as above)</summary>\r\n\r\n![](https://i.gyazo.com/8ae08a222010b063b636543e83d3590d.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n* If the end user's config references the rule `react/no-typos`, the config scope is empty. Since the root node of the tree has multiple descendants called `eslint-plugin-react`, the rule reference is ambiguous.\r\n* If the end user's config references the rule `bar::react/no-typos`, the config scope is non-empty, so the resolution strategy then tries to resolve the rule `react/no-typos` from the `eslint-config-bar` node in the tree. Since there is only one descendent of that node called `eslint-plugin-react`, the rule would successfully resolve to the `no-typos` rule of that plugin.\r\n\r\n## Notable advantages and disadvantages of this strategy\r\n\r\n* This strategy allows shareable configs to specify plugins and other shareable configs as direct dependencies, without manual installation steps by the user. It also ensures that the end user can always override any extended configuration.\r\n* Any ambiguity in a rule reference in a given config file will be immediately apparent to the author of that config file, since the presence of an ambiguity only depends on the descendants of that config in the config tree. In other words, there is no situation where a particular user's configuration would be broken and they would need to lobby the author of their shareable config to make a change (because in that case, the shareable config would be broken for all of its users and likely would have been fixed before publishing).\r\n* The strategy is mostly backwards-compatible with existing setups, because in existing setups there is always at most one version of a plugin reachable from anywhere in a config tree. The exceptions are cases where an existing config unnecessarily uses a `plugins` array to override rule configurations from a shareable config's plugin; with this change, the shareable config and the end user's config would end up configuring two independent versions of the same plugin. To fix this in both versions, the end user's config could simply remove that plugin from their `plugins` array. There are also probably setups now where a shareable config overrides the plugin rules configured by a sibling shareable config; these could be fixed in both versions by making one shareable config a child of the other.\r\n* Adding a plugin to a shareable config is a breaking change for the shareable config, because it creates the possibility of an ambiguity in ancestor configs. I consider this to be acceptable because:\r\n    * Adding a plugin to a shareable config would usually be a breaking change anyway, because the shareable config would be enabling new rules from that plugin, causing more errors to be reported to the end user.\r\n    * With the current status quo, adding a plugin to a shareable config is always a breaking change because the end user needs to install it.\r\n* With this strategy, an end user would be exposed to some details of the layout of shareable configs that they depend on. For example, if a shareable config `eslint-config-foo` has two descendant plugins with the same name, then the config scope that is needed to refer to those rules is \"contagious\". In other words, if `eslint-config-foo` needs to use a reference like `bar::react/no-typos` to avoid ambiguities, then a config that extends `eslint-config-foo` needs to use something like `foo::bar::react/no-typos` to configure that rule.\r\n    * I consider this to be acceptable because end users are already exposed to many of the details of their shareable configs, in that changes to shareable configs will lead to different linting errors/warnings being reported on the end user's code. I think it's very important to protect configs from caring about details of *sibling* shareable configs, since this would create implicit dependencies between the sibling configs where no dependency otherwise existed. However, I think it's fine if configs are exposed to some details of *descendent* shareable configs, since there is already a dependency relationship between them anyway.\r\n    * I believe that this problem (exposure to the details of dependency configs) is inherent to any solution that both (a) gives users the power to arbitrarily override third-party configuration, and (b) allows third-party configuration to pull in custom rules from multiple external sources. To illustrate this point, I'll examine two other proposals that attempted to solve the problem, and argue that the problem still exists even with those alternate proposals. \r\n        * https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458#issuecomment-255487235 proposed adding an `exportedPlugins` field for shareable configs. This has an advantage that it makes the exposed API of a shareable config explicit. However, with this alternate proposal, ESLint would have to require each shareable config to export *all* of its dependency configs (otherwise the end user would be unable to reference rules from the dependency configs in order to override them). As a result, the dependency chain of a shareable config would still end up in an end-user config.\r\n        * https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458#issuecomment-257161846 proposed solving the problem by using plugins that depend on other plugins and reexport the rules of their dependencies, without any changes to ESLint core. It suggests two possible ways of re-exporting the rules: either a plugin could export them directly with the same name, or it could give the names a common prefix. Unfortunately, both of these strategies have problems:\r\n            * If plugins re-export rules using the same names as the ones provided by their dependencies, then they will encounter a conflict when two of their dependencies export a rule with the same name. In effect, I think this strategy just changes the initial problem of having plugins with the same name to a new problem of having rules with the same name, and shifts the burden of solving it onto plugin authors. Even if a plugin created an ad-hoc fix for this by using a different name for one of the rules, it would still have the possibility of breaking again if one of its dependency plugins added a rule with the same name as one of its other dependency plugins.\r\n            * If plugins put rules behind namespaces, then when a namespacing plugin depends on another namespacing plugin, the namespaces would end up getting compounded. In order to use one of the rules, an end user would need to repeat back multiple levels of namespaces, effectively restating the plugin's dependency chain again. This would result in the same problem as with the current proposal.\r\n\r\n            If these problems with alternative proposals seem like they would only occur in unlikely scenarios, I think it's worth noting that the problem in this proposal of having deep conflicting rule names in this proposal would also be somewhat unlikely. We should certainly make sure users have the ability to handle those scenarios, and give straightforward advice about how to do so (namely, that shareable configs need to bump the major version when adding plugins or adding dependencies that add plugins), but it's also important to make sure we make fair comparisons between proposals, and not compare the common cases of one proposal to the inconvenient edge cases of another.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've spent a lot of time on this proposal, and would appreciate any feedback (particularly feedback that identifies problems with it). I think the current state of how plugins and configs are loaded is causing a large number of problems in the ecosystem, and I'm hoping we can work on this to finally pin down a solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10643/reactions","total_count":47,"+1":37,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-22T08:38:29Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T08:38:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10644","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10644/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10644/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10644/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10644","id":343387519,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDMzODc1MTk=","number":10644,"title":"eslint

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot needed as this is a clean install.\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n  \r\n  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md\r\n  \r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\nThe project uses `react-scripts@1.1.5`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(paste the output of the command here)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nClone DanielRuf/coding-coach, checkout the feature/yarn-pnp branch and install with Yarn nightly and run `yarn start`. \r\n\r\n1. Clone DanielRuf/coding-coach\r\n2. checkout the feature/yarn-pnp branch\r\n3. install Yarn nightly\r\n4. run `yarn && yarn start`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write what you thought would happen.)\r\n\r\nIt should run without any errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible!

From the top of my head, these are the possible solutions, and the reason they don't currently work:\r\n\r\n- We could recommend them to `require` the plugins themselves. This doesn't work because ESLint requires the plugins to be plugin names.\r\n- We could recommend them to use `require.resolve` to give ESLint an explicit path to the module. This doesn't work because ESLint automatically prepends `eslint-plugin` at the beginning of the absolute path, making it invalid.\r\n\r\nCould you consider changing the second point so that `/foo/bar` will become `/foo/eslint-plugin-bar` instead of `eslint-plugin-/foo/bar`? And `/foo/eslint-plugin-bar` would stay unchanged? I'm open to make the PR myself if I get the greenlight. It won't solve the duplicate package problem, but at least give a workaround until #10643 gets implemented 🙂 \r\n\r\ncc @ilyavolodin

Summary**: ESLint's plugin- and config-loading mechanism currently depends on implementation details of package managers like `npm` and `yarn`, rather than intended behavior. (In short, `eslint` needs to be able to load plugins like `eslint-plugin-react` relative to its own location, even though `eslint` never specifies `eslint-plugin-react` in its own dependencies.) This causes ESLint to unexpectedly break when using package management tools like Lerna or Yarn Plug N' Play, which is creating problems for downstream tools.\r\n\r\nIt appears that any solution to this problem would require shareable configs to be able to load their plugins from their own dependencies (or from a config-provided absolute path). As discussed in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458 and https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10643, this would introduce a problem if two loaded plugins have the same name, because the user wouldn't be able to independently configure the rules from the two plugins.\r\n\r\nIt seems like we have several ways we could proceed:\r\n\r\n1. Load plugins from the dependencies of the config that specifies them, and introduce a mechanism for users to disambiguate plugins with the same name (e.g. as proposed in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10643). Note that https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10643 is semver-major.\r\n1. Load plugins from the dependencies of the config that specifies them, and throw a fatal error if two loaded plugins have the same name. (This would also be semver-major, although it would require significantly less implementation effort than (1).)\r\n1. Continue loading plugins from the location of the `eslint` package, but allow configs to specify absolute paths to plugins. Throw a fatal error if two loaded plugins have the same name. (This would not be semver-major, although it would introduce the same potential user confusion (2).\r\n1. Don't change anything, and decide that we don't support using Lerna or Yarn Plug N' Play. I would not recommend this option; ostensibly a linter shouldn't care what package management strategy is being used.\r\n\r\nSolution (3) seems to be the only option that fixes the issue without a breaking change. If we adopt solution (3), I think we should commit to also adopting solution (1) or (2) in the next major release, otherwise the situation will end up very messy. In past discussions, the idea of throwing a fatal error when encountering duplicate plugin names (i.e. implementing (2) or (3)) has been very contentious.\r\n\r\nI think solution (1) would be the best solution in the long term, but based on past discussions I suspect this opinion might also be contentious. \r\n\r\n**TSC Question**: How should we address this issue?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/425169945/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1871647990,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4NzE2NDc5OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1871647990","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-27T17:07:57Z","label":{"name":"tsc agenda","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/425282914","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10125#issuecomment-425282914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10125","id":425282914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTI4MjkxNA==","user":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T00:26:41Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T00:26:41Z","body":"This issue was discussed in [today's TSC meeting](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/e2286977ccade5b131599a07a6fe7c78be034fcf/notes/2018/2018-09-27.md#declaring-shareable-configs-and-plugins-in-packagejson-is-unreliable).

subject has been covered in various other topics (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10125 and derivates), but basically the way ESLint works doesn't allow `react-scripts` to cleanly provide its own lint plugins. Since it's an important use case I want to support, something has to be done.\r\n\r\nThis diff makes it so that `react-scripts` becomes a fallback of its own if found in the dependency tree (it still has a lower priority than the top-level fallback). Note that these fallbacks are not considered for files loaded from the top-level package (meaning that an application file doing `require('foo')` without listing `foo` in the top-level `package.json` will throw, even if `react-scripts` depends on `foo`). This ensures people won't accidentally rely on the fallback when developing their own applications.\r\n\r\n**Test plan**\r\n\r\nI explicitly don't want to test this, since it's a workaround and this kind of behavior should not be expected globally speaking.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/6449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1905040119,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5MDUwNDAxMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1905040119","actor":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-15T19:43:03Z","label":{"name":"breaking","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/434665994","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10125#issuecomment-434665994","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10125","id":434665994,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNDY2NTk5NA==","user":{"login":"sibelius","id":2005841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDU4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2005841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius","html_url":"https://github.com/sibelius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibelius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-31T12:19:35Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T12:19:35Z","body":"I
