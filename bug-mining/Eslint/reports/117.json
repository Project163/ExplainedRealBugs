Currently, the cache feature does not seem as useful or intuitive as it might be in that only information for files that pass linting with no warnings or errors is saved in the cache. I wonder if the cache feature could offer even more of a performance benefit if the cache were to store information for files with lint warnings or errors as well such that they don't have to run through a linting process if they haven't been changed since they were last linted with the cache feature enabled?\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\nPerhaps we can extend the usage of the cache such that information for files with lint warnings or errors is also saved to the cache? @IanVS, following up on [this comment](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2998#issuecomment-363171051)","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9948/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9948/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
