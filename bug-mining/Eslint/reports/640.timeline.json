\r\n\r\n* Thank you for your confirmation :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> So it seems that in Node.js different operations may use different Promise constructors?\r\n* I think that since `fs` is old package, it uses polyfill Promise class.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* I have already found two ways to fix now.\r\n  1. Change argument of `#retry()` function to async in ESLint repository.\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      -                return retrier.retry(() => fs.readFile(...)\r\n      +                return retrier.retry(async () => fs.readFile(...)\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  2. Change the logic to confirm Promise in `#retry()` of  `@humanwhocodes/retry` repository.\r\n  \r\n      ```js\r\n      -        if (!(result instanceof Promise)) {\r\n      +        if (\r\n      +          !(result instanceof Promise)\r\n      +          && (!result || typeof result.then !== 'function')\r\n      +        ) {\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n* I think that `2.` is a fixing ad-hoc, thus we can select

I had used `ESLint#lintFiles()` in Jest with `ESLint@8.x.x`. As we know, Jest works as CommonJS. But It did not require to use `--experimental-vm-modules` flag.\r\n\r\n2. I changed the code to fit Flat Config with `9.1.1`, but it was not work. Because new code of `ESLint#lintFiles()` uses dynamic import.\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/v9.1.1/lib/eslint/eslint.js#L317\r\n    ```js\r\n    async function loadFlatConfigFile(filePath) {\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        const config = (await import(fileURL)).default;\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/v9.1.1/lib/eslint/eslint.js#L369\r\n    ```js\r\n    async function calculateConfigArray(eslint, { ... }) {\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        if (configFilePath) {\r\n            const fileConfig = await loadFlatConfigFile(configFilePath);\r\n\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/v9.1.1/lib/eslint/eslint.js#L815\r\n    ```js\r\n    class ESLint {\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        async lintFiles(patterns) {\r\n            ...\r\n\r\n            const configs = await calculateConfigArray(this, eslintOptions);\r\n\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n3.
