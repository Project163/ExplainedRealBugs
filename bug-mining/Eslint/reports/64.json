This could be confusing for users who are figuring out how to use the API with the REPL, because they might be inclined to use `eslint.linter` despite the fact that `eslint.linter` is deprecated. The distinction between `eslint.linter` and `eslint.Linter` is also likely to be unclear.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, I think we should make `eslint.linter` non-enumerable. That way, it will still be available to old integrations using `eslint.linter`, but it's unlikely to create confusion for new users.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure whether this should be considered a breaking change -- it could change the behavior of something like `Object.keys(require(\"eslint\"))`, but I don't know why anyone would do that.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9270/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
