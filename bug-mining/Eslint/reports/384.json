Replacing `inquirer` with `enquirer` would shave off about half the the package size.\r\n\r\n`inquirer`: [![install size](https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=inquirer)](https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=inquirer)\r\n`enquirer`: [![install size](https://packagephobia.now.sh/badge?p=enquirer)](https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=enquirer)\r\n\r\nAdded benefit would be improving [the start up time](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer#-performance) (module load time):\r\n```\r\nenquirer: 4.013ms\r\ninquirer: 286.717ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nYes.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13208/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
