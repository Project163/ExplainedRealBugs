issue to improve documentation for `no-func-assign`. In particular, to add named function expressions.\r\n\r\nThe actual document doesn't even mention named function expressions and doesn't have any examples with them. Also, there are no test cases, so it's possible that the original intention was to check only function declarations:\r\n\r\n> This rule disallows reassigning function declarations.\r\n\r\nEither way,
