Remaining rule configurations are grouped with comments:\r\n\r\n* Rules that Remix explicitly configures differently from the default\r\n* Rules enabled by `rules/core.js` that aren't needed for TypeScript code\r\n* Rules that enforce a style point not agreed upon by Remix <sup>✳️</sup>\r\n* Ones that could eventually be investigated for enabling\r\n\r\nAddresses: #6126\r\n\r\n- [ ] Docs - ... where would I document this? Should I continue to hold off until this is reviewed?\r\n- ~[ ] Tests~: `yarn lint` still passes, yes?\r\n\r\nTesting Strategy: I'd encourage folks to try this out on any large Remix repository written with TypeScript. And let me know what those are so I can test them out too? 😄 \r\n\r\nNote that this does not _(yet?)_ tackle two good next steps:\r\n\r\n* Enable the ever more powerful rules from [`plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs#recommended-requiring-type-checking)\r\n    * I would highly recommend this, either as an addition to this PR or as a next step.\r\n* <sup>✳️</sup>[typescript-eslint@v6, currently in beta](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v6-beta), separates out any remaining _stylistic_ rules from the _recommended_ configs.
