(Give an overview)\r\n\r\n- Added support for `Language#normalizeLanguageOptions()`\r\n- Moved normalization logic from `linter.js` into `js/index.js`\r\n- Updated the docs about language plugins\r\n\r\nfixes #19037\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nI left duplicates of `isEspree()` and `normalizeEcmaVersionForLanguageOptions()` in `linter.js` and `js/index.js`. The ones in `linter.js` can be removed when we drop eslintrc support. Another approach would be to export those methods from `js/index.js` into `linter.js` directly if we want to remove the duplication. I'm unsure of the best approach (these functions aren't likely to change).\r\n\r\nI also wasn't sure if we needed separate tests for this change. \r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004
