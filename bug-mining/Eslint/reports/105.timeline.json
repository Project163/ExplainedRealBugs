It's also very widely generic, and although it could replace max-statements in some uses, it checks a different metric. It also does not conflict with any other rules, and it's pretty much independent from everything short of the language itself.\r\n\r\nOther linters and style guides in various languages already do similar:\r\n\r\n* Rubocop has Metrics/MethodLength which does exactly what I propose here, including the proposed option.\r\n* Google's JS style guide (by proxy of their C++ style guide), recommends 40 lines or fewer per function.\r\n* The Linux Kernel's style guide recommends 48 lines or fewer.\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nAdded a new rule \"max-lines-per-function\", as suggested in original issue #9842. Although this issue hasn't been approved yet, I wrote a similar plugin for my own purposes and thought I might as well submit it to the prioject.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nNo","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10188/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/379077779","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9842#issuecomment-379077779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9842","id":379077779,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTA3Nzc3OQ==","user":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-05T21:10:00Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T21:10:00Z","body":"@isiahmeadows Very sorry for the long delay on this.

there's a compelling case for implementing a line-based rule here when we should already have one for statements.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/379077779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1559719999,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU1OTcxOTk5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1559719999","actor":{"login":"dead-claudia","id":4483844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4483844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia","html_url":"https://github.com/dead-claudia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-05T21:10:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1559720001,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NTk3MjAwMDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1559720001","actor":{"login":"dead-claudia","id":4483844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4483844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia","html_url":"https://github.com/dead-claudia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-05T21:10:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/379135358","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9842#issuecomment-379135358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9842","id":379135358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTEzNTM1OA==","user":{"login":"dead-claudia","id":4483844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODM4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4483844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia","html_url":"https://github.com/dead-claudia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-claudia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dead-

Some expressions (think: long method chains, JSX/hyperscript trees, functional pipelines) could take several lines, and `max-statements` would see only a few statements.\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example, in [this method](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/next/examples/dbmonster/mithril/app.js#L10-L34):\r\n\r\n- `max-statements` would see exactly one statement, even though it's 25 lines long.\r\n- `max-depth` would see no nested blocks, so it wouldn't be a limiting factor here, either.\r\n- `max-nested-callbacks` would see a depth of at most 3, which is much lower than what most care about (default is 10, but I keep it at 4 for my personal projects).\r\n- `complexity` is 1, so it has little-to-no use here.\r\n\r\nAnother concrete example, [this method](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/blob/next/examples/todomvc/todomvc.js#L89-L125):\r\n\r\n- `max-statements` would only see two statements, even though it's 36 lines long (a large method by any standard).\r\n- `max-depth` would see a depth of at most 1 - there's no blocks, just calls and function expressions.\r\n- `max-nested-callbacks` would see a depth of at most 3.\r\n- The only rule that would have much of an effect limiting it would be `complexity`, which would rate the outermost at 7, the `.map` callback at 3, and the rest at 1 (default is 10).\r\n\r\nSo there's uses for it, just in the more pathological cases.
