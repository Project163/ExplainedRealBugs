As long as something works in npm, I just don't think it's worth the time to figure out what pnpm is doing differently.\n\nWarnings and errors are good - they let us know when we accidentally break contracts in ways that would be difficult to investigate ourselves. And isn't that the whole point of Eslint? 🙂\n\nAlso keep in mind that something not crashing in your own npm install doesn't mean the application will work properly (even for other npm users!). It may / did / will lead to strange cases of dependencies being added / removed / updated as you shuffle seemingly unrelated dependencies.\n\nIf you ask me, libraries like Eslint should probably consider _not_ using npm as their package manager of choice (in their own repository, I mean), and prefer using a stricter package manager that checks your dependencies. If it works there you're pretty much guaranteed it'll work everywhere, when there's no guarantee the other way around.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2649263021/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arcanis","id":1037931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzc5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1037931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis","html_url":"https://github.com/arcanis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16254955219,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc6pfhWzzwAAAAPI3u7T","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/16254955219","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2d493420dc78de87204ea224322ebfb74c115bbf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/2d493420dc78de87204ea224322ebfb74c115bbf","created_at":"2025-02-10T21:19:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-10T21:20:31Z","updated_at":"2025-02-10T21:20:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19422","id":2843677363,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAKjKDc6KtkAi","number":19422,"title":"docs:

It may / did / will lead to strange cases of dependencies being added / removed / updated as you shuffle seemingly unrelated dependencies.\n\n@arcanis In my understanding, it's not ESLint that doesn't work well with pnpm, it's external packages such as `eslint-plugin-format` that don't expect and aren't tested under the standards enforced by pnpm. ESLint is the third party in this scenario, and the best we can do is providing advice to our users on how to work around the problems they may encounter with those tools. If you have a better idea, please let us know.\n\n> If you ask me, libraries like Eslint should probably consider _not_ using npm as their package manager of choice (in their own repository, I mean), and prefer using a stricter package manager that checks your dependencies. If it works there you're pretty much guaranteed it'll work everywhere, when there's no guarantee the other way around.\n\nThis wouldn't make a difference as long as the incompatibilities with pnpm arise with other packages.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2649325266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16255448815,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc6pfhWzzwAAAAPI5nbv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/16255448815","actor":{"login":"arcanis","id":1037931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzc5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1037931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis","html_url":"https://github.com/arcanis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-10T21:52:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16255448828,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc6pfhWzzwAAAAPI5nb8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/16255448828","actor":{"login":"arcanis","id":1037931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzc5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1037931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis","html_url":"https://github.com/arcanis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcanis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-10T21:52:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16267780386,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAKjKDc6pfhWzzwAAAAPJoqEi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/16267780386","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-11T16:35:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16267802161,"node_id":"CE_lADOAKjKDc6pfhWzzwAAAAPJovYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/16267802161","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ
