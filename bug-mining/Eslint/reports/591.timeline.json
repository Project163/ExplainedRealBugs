async functions, returning awaited promises no longer has any performance penalty and is now faster than returning promises directly.\r\n\r\nBecause we cannot detect what the result type of a `CallExpression` or the type of a `MemberExpression`, or the type of an `Identifier`, warnings related to whether an actual Promise is being returned cannot be processed. Strictly from at an AST level, we can detect `Literal` node types and `undefined`.\r\n\r\n* Detect await being used on `Literal` node type\r\n* Detect await being used on an `Identifier` named `undefined`\r\n* Detect await being used on a `ConditionalExpression` that returns either a `Literal` type or `undefined`.\r\n* Detect await being used on a void operation (results in `undefined`)\r\n\r\nFuther changes can be made to detect syntaxes where a `Literal` type would be returned, such as\r\n\r\n* await (4 + 3)\r\n* await ('foo' + 'bar')\r\n\r\nFuture changes may also, suggest rewriting awaited `CondtionExpression` nodes such as:\r\n\r\n* async function foo(value) { return await (value ? true : bar()) }\r\n\r\nThis would require more extensive testing.\r\n\r\nFixes #17345\r\n\r\nSee: https://v8.dev/blog/fast-async\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Thank you for contributing!\r\n\r\n    ESLint adheres to the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://eslint.org/conduct).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this pull request?
