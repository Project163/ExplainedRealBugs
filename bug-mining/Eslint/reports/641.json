Could we also move those rules out of core, with the intent to move them to eslint-stylistic?\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nRules such as `curly` that are at or just above the formatting level suffer from many of the maintainability drawbacks mentioned in #17522.  The eslint-stylistic project is intentionally named _stylistic_ rather than _formatting_ so that it can encompass more than just formatting rules. See https://github.com/eslint-stylistic/eslint-stylistic/issues/26.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nSorry for raising this so late after the initial discussion!","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17681/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
