(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nChanged `prefer-object-spread` fixer to remove everything before the opening paren of the argument list, instead of just `callee`. This should remove TypeScript's type arguments as well.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nThis looks like a correct change even without TS, because it removes whitespace between `Object.assign` and the opening paren of arguments, which is what similar rules usually do (via `fixer.replaceText` on the whole `CallExpression`).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3157455479,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE1NzQ1NTQ3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3157455479","actor":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-23T23:08:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3157455574,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMxNTc0NTU1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3157455574","actor":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4955c50dc9e89b4077b28e35f065d45e89bdccd7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/4955c50dc9e89b4077b28e35f065d45e89bdccd7","created_at":"2020-03-23T23:08:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3786559207,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50Mzc4NjU1OTIwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3786559207","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-21T00:29:24Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3786559229,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3ODY1NTkyMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3786559229","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/foll
