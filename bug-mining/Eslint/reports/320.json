In particular:\r\n\r\n* Reference to a group that appears later in the regular expression. JS doesn't support forward references, but it also doesn't disallow backreferences that appear as forward references - they are treated as valid, but silently ignored.\r\n* Reference to a group from within the group (nested reference). Same as above.\r\n* Reference to a group that is in a negative lookaround from outside of that negative lookaround ([spec 21.2.2.8.2](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-runtime-semantics-canonicalize-ch) - Note 3).\r\n\r\nApplies to both numbered and named backreferences.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Warns about a potential error (problem)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// same as /^(a)$/\r\n/^\\1(a)$/.test(\"a\") // true\r\n/^\\1(a)$/.test(\"aa\") // false\r\n\r\n// same as /^(a)$/\r\n/^(a\\1)$/.test(\"a\") // true\r\n/^(a\\1)$/.test(\"aa\") // false\r\n\r\n/^(?:a|b)(c|d)e\\2(f|g)$/\r\n\r\n/a(?!(b|c){2}).([a-z])d\\1/\r\n/(?<!(b|c))a(d|e)f\\1/\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nIt prevents very possible errors in the code:\r\n\r\n* User may be unaware that JS doesn't support forward and nested references, because many languages do support them. Even worse, there are no parsing or runtime errors from the engine.\r\n* Unintended reference - reference to a wrong group as a consequence of another error (e.g., shifted index, wrong parentheses etc.).\r\n\r\nNote: this rule targets only backreferences that are parsed as such. It does not aim to disallow \"look-like backreferences\":\r\n\r\n* Numbered reference to a group that doesn't exist. `\\1`...`\\7` should be already a parsing error, or (by Anex B) an octal escape. This should be probably an enhancement for the `no-octal-escape` rule, which currently targets only strings. `\\8` or `\\9` should be a parsing error but it's usually treated as just useless identity escape.\r\n* `\\1`...`\\9` in character classes. Similar to above, this is either a parsing error, octal escape or useless identity escape.\r\n* Named reference to a group that doesn't exist. This is either a parsing error (when there is at least one named group or the `u` flag) or just a sequence of characters (for backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12673/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
