What is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)\r\n\r\n[X] Add something to the core.\r\n\r\n### What changes did you make? (Give an overview)\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `ignorePatterns` top-level property into config files. This feature has been approved in [RFC 22](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/tree/master/designs/2019-core-options). People can use `ignorePatterns` property instead of `.eslintignore` file. Also, people can provide the `ignorePatterns` setting with shareable configs. It will reduce the cost of setup of new repositories.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n# .eslintrc.yml\r\nignorePatterns:\r\n- /dist\r\n- /temp\r\n- /test.js\r\n- \"*.min.js\"\r\nextends:\r\n- eslint:recommended\r\nrules:\r\n  semi: error\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Design\r\n\r\nI removed `IgnoredPaths` class that had been handling `.eslintignore`, `--ignore-path`, `--ignore-pattern`, and `--no-ignore`. Instead, now `ConfigArray` handles ignore patterns.\r\n\r\n```jsonc\r\n// Example of `ConfigArray`.\r\n[\r\n    { name: \"DefaultIgnorePattern\", ignorePattern: { /*...*/ } },\r\n    { name: \".eslintrc.yml » eslint:recommended\", /*...*/ },\r\n    { name: \".eslintrc.yml\", /*...*/ },\r\n    { name: \".eslintignore\", ignorePattern: { /*...*/ } },\r\n    { name: \"CLIOptions\", ignorePattern: { /*...*/ } }, // --ignore-pattern\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike above, config array contains the ignore pattern data additionally if existed. It will merge ignore patterns of all config array element in the order as-is then create a `node-ignore` instance. This means, `ignorePatterns` properties will be merged in the same order as the other settings, and we can use the unignoring with `!`.\r\n\r\nClasses:\r\n\r\n-   **`IgnorePattern` class** (new!)\r\n    It has `basePath` and `patterns` as similar to `OverrideTester` class that handles `overrides[i].files`. The `IgnorePattern.createIgnore()` static method creates the predicate function from multiple `IgnorePattern` instances.\r\n-   **`ConfigArray` class**\r\n    Now the array elements have `ignorePattern` property that is an `IgnorePattern` instance or undefined. The `ConfigArray#extractConfig()` method merges the `IgnorePattern` instances by `IgnorePattern.createIgnore()` static method.\r\n-   **`ConfigArrayFactory` class**\r\n    Now it recognizes `ignorePatterns` top-level property in config files then creates `ignorePattern` properties into config array elements.\r\n    Also, now it has new two methods `factory.loadESLintIgnore(filePath)` and `factory.loadDefaultESLintIgnore()` to load `.eslintignore` and something like.\r\n-   **`CascadingConfigArrayFactory` class**\r\n    Now it recognizes `--ignore-pattern`, `--ignore-path`, and `.eslintignore` then creates the corresponding config array elements by a `ConfigArrayFactory` instance.\r\n-   **`FileEnumerator` class**\r\n    Now it has the updated ignoring logic.\r\n-   **`CLIEngine` class**\r\n    Now it has the updated ignoring logic in `executeOnFiles()`, `executeOnText()`, and `isPathIgnored()`.\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n\r\n-   First, I moved the tests in `ignored-paths.js` to `cli-engine.js` (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/commit/a630d9e3f948018c41cfca00777517f0f614093a). Now it tests public APIs instead of internal classes. (I'd like to test the public APIs primarily. Many tests that depend on internal structures make tough to refactor code.)\r\n-   Then, I added several tests to `cli-engine.js` to test `isPathIgnored()` and `executeOnFiles()` with the new feature. (`executeOnText()` uses `isPathIgnored()` internally)\r\n\r\n### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n- Are there more tests we should?\r\n- How do I improve the documentation?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12274/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3042085053,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzA0MjA4NTA1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3042085053","actor":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-17T02:13:23Z","label":{"name":"good
