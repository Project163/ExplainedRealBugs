(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?** \r\nNew option.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n    var name =     'Foo'; //We should get a warning for the tab in between, not for the initial one\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?** \r\nA warning because there are tabs for indentation purposes (in the beginning) and for non-necessarily-indentation purposes (after the assignment)\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nAllows indentation tabs using a proper option, but not non-indenting tabs. This could be something like ```allow-indenting```.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10256/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
