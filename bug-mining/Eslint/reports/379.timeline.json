Internally, the floating point representation of the resulting Number would be exactly `2 ** 80`, but the number could also be represented by literal `1208925819614629200000000`. In a way, the floating-point representation would be accurate but not precise. We could choose to only allow the version with trailing zeros.\r\n\r\n(If we choose to allow the exact literal, it could be kind of annoying to figure out what the exact mathematical value actually is without `BigInt` support, given that `Number#toString` starts truncating digits after a certain point.)\r\n\r\nHow about `11111111111111112` and `11111111111111113`, which will end up with a `Number` representation of `11111111111111112`? In this case, there are no trailing zeros that the `3` could be replaced with. I think it would make most sense to report `11111111111111113` while allowing `11111111111111112`, but this seems slightly inconsistent with the first example.\r\n\r\nMaybe the general rule here is to

You actually lose one digit of precision if you remove any non-significant zeros. And the same behavior happens if the number contains a decimal point.\r\n\r\nSo, for instance\r\n```js\r\n// 16 significant digits\r\nconst num1 = 8888888888888884\r\nconst num2 = 8888888888888883\r\nnum===num2\r\n// output: false\r\n\r\n// 16 significant digits and 1 zero\r\nconst num3 = 88888888888888840\r\nconst num4 = 88888888888888830\r\nnum3===num4\r\n// output:

Round *actualValue* to *numDigits* significant digits, and raise a linting error unless the result is equivalent to *intendedValue*.\r\n\r\nThis seems like it would have the desired effect from https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11279#issuecomment-465382710 of allowing things like `11111111111111112` but not `11111111111111113`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best way to actually implement this is, given that it involves operating on mathematical values that might ~~be repeating decimals or~~ be very large, making them hard to represent with either `Number` or `BigInt`. (edit: Actually, the values can't be repeating decimals, which might simplify things.) It seems like it should be possible to use a combination of clever string manipulation, `BigInt`, and [`Number#toFixed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed).\r\n\r\nOther implementation notes:\r\n\r\n* Depending on how you represent the mathematical values, checking the \"equivalent\" condition in step (iv) could be tricky due to the possibility of scientific notation, stray decimal points, etc. It might be useful to normalize \"equivalent\" values to a canonical representation.\r\n* \"Rounding something to a specific number of significant digits\" has a different meaning depending on whether the whether the original literal is binary, hex, or decimal.\r\n* The implementation might want to handle base-ten numbers and everything else as two different cases. (`Number#toFixed` can only produce a base-ten output, but conveniently `Number#toFixed` should only be necessary for base-ten literals anyway since other literals are always integers.) In principle it would be possible to make a fully general implementation that doesn't need separate cases (e.g. by converting to `BigInt` and calling `toString(base)`), but this might be more trouble than it's worth since it seems hard to avoid precision losses.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/569830127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/569949153","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11279#issuecomment-569949153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11279","id":569949153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTk0OTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"jmoore914","id":30698083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjk4MDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30698083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoore914","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T15:52:33Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T15:52:33Z","body":"OK, here's what I came up with: https://github.com/jmoore914/eslint/tree/no-loss-of-precision\r\n\r\nIt's working perfectly for decimal values and values with scientific notation.

From taking a look at your implementation it seems like it works by getting rid of any exponential part, adding a small power of ten based on how many significant figures are used, and seeing if the resulting value changes.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting approach, but I'm not sure it's going to work well. I don't think we want to report an error for literals like `9007199254740992`, because the result would be that there is no way to express that literal regardless of the number of significant figures used. Instead, it would be better to allow `9007199254740992` but disallow `9007199254740993`.\r\n\r\nUsing `Number#toPrecision` is a very good idea though (it seems like it avoids a lot of the pitfalls of `toFixed` for this use case).\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on the implementation strategy from https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11279#issuecomment-569830127? To me it seems like that would be less likely to run into weird edge cases, and it might end up being a lot simpler anyway when using `toPrecision`. As an example, when evaluating `9007199254740993` with that strategy:\r\n\r\n* `\"9007199254740993\"` has 16 significant digits.\r\n* `Number(\"9007199254740993\").toPrecision(16)` is `\"9007199254740992\"`.\r\n* `\"9007199254740993\"` and `\"9007199254740992\"` don't represent the same mathematical value, so report an error.\r\n\r\nAt that point the only difficulty for base-ten numbers would be to check whether two different (possibly-scientific-notation) number strings represent the same mathematical value, which seems like a solvable problem by normalizing them both to scientific notation manually.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/569996275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/569999069","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11279#issuecomment-569999069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11279","id":569999069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTk5OTA2OQ==","user":{"login":"jmoore914","id":30698083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjk4MDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30698083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoore914","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T22:22:28Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T22:22:28Z","body":"Thanks

it, that makes sense. In that case I think the overall approach seems fine if we remove the +/- check.\r\n\r\nThe fact that `stripToSignificantDigits` removes all place value information (including the decimal point and the scientific notation exponent) seems a bit weird to me. It's not technically normalizing numbers since e.g. `\"1e7\"` and `\"1e8\"` will get \"normalized\" to the same value. Also, `\"1.00\"` and `\"1.0\"` will get normalized to different values, which is odd if the desired behavior is to check for equivalent mathematical values (it seems like we actually want to remove all \"mathematically-irrelevant\" digits with this function, rather than removing significant digits). Admittedly, I can't think of a case where this would cause the rule to return the wrong result, since floating-point precision won't cause numbers to be off by factor of ten.\r\n\r\nSome other potentially useful test cases/edge cases to consider:\r\n\r\n* The literal 0, which should be considered to have one significant digit (it might break things if it ends up being counted as zero significant digits by mistake). Note that `0.0` also has one significant digit (not two).\r\n* Literals that are greater than `Number.MAX_VALUE`. `Number(\"1e999\").toPrecision(1)` outputs the string `\"Infinity\"` -- we should double-check that this doesn't break anything.\r\n* Literals with a very large number of significant figures, such as 17498005798264095394980017816940970922825355447145699491406164851279623993595007385788105416184430592 (2<sup>333</sup>, which has 101 digits). `Number.toPrecision` throws an error when asked to provide more than 100 digits of precision. I don't think it's too important for the rule to be completely correct in that case, but we should make sure it doesn't crash. One solution could be to pretend the user supplied 100 significant digits, even if they actually supplied more (this could theoretically result in some false negatives if the user was trying to use e.g. 2<sup>333</sup> - 1 in some math calculation, but hopefully that's pretty rare). Alternatively, we could just always report an error when there are more than 100 significant digits in a literal.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor non-base-10 literals: `Number#toPrecision` doesn't allow us to produce non-base-10 strings, but we could shim something like `toPrecision` with:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction toPrecisionWithBase(number, significantDigits, base) {\r\n    const lastSignificantPlaceValue = base ** (Math.floor(Math.log(number) / Math.log(base)) - significantDigits + 1);\r\n    const roundedValue = Math.round(number / lastSignificantPlaceValue) * lastSignificantPlaceValue;\r\n\r\n    // Note: Unlike Number#toPrecision, this does not add any trailing zeros after decimal points.\r\n    return roundedValue.toString(base);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAside from that I think the procedure for non-base-10 numbers should work the same as the procedure for base 10 numbers, except a bit simpler because everything is an integer and there's no scientific notation.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/570006827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/570788030","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11279#issuecomment-570788030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11279","id":570788030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MDc4ODAzMA==","user":{"login":"jmoore914","id":30698083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjk4MDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30698083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914","html_url":"https://github.com/jmoore914","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmoore914/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-04T14:03:55Z","updated_at":"2020-01-04T14:03:55Z","body":"Thanks, those are some interesting edge cases!
