(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\nNew default behavior\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n  #unusedField = 5;\r\n  #usedFieldOnlyInWrite = 42;\r\n  #usedWhenReadingAndWriting = 500;\r\n  someMethod() {\r\n    this.#usedFieldOnlyInWrite = 42;\r\n    this.#usedWhenReadingAndWriting += 1;\r\n  }\r\n  someOtherMethod() {\r\n    return this.#usedWhenReadingAndWriting;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\nNothing\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nReport unused fields declared in a class. In the above example, it should report that both `#unusedField` and `#usedFieldOnlyInWrite` are unused. This should be possible, as private fields are only concerned in a particular class context, so you can collect all fields in a class, iterate through all usages and mark does that are never read as unused.\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nI would be able to give it a go, but I am not sure how difficult this would be.","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14859/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14859/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
