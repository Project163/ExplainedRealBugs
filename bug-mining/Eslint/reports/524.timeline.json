I would like the rule to handle this to improve the developer experience and make it useful for deprecations across a distributed organization.\r\n\r\n**Does this change cause the rule to produce more or fewer warnings?**\r\nMore potentially\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented? (New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\nThere are a few options:\r\n1. The configuration allows multiple paths with the same name so that you can have different custom messages for specific importName members.\r\n2. The configuration allows a list of messages that map to the importNames.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\nFor #1 above:\r\n```js\r\n    'no-restricted-imports': [2, {\r\n      'paths': [\r\n        {\r\n          'name': '@someorg/api',\r\n          'importNames': [\r\n            'fetchThings',\r\n          ],\r\n          'message': 'fetchThings has been deprecated as of April 19, please use fetchWidgets instead.'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          'name': '@someorg/api',\r\n          'importNames': [\r\n            'postThings',\r\n          ],\r\n          'message': 'postThings has been deprecated as of April 19, please use getWidgets instead.'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          'name': '@someorg/api',\r\n          'importNames': [\r\n            'parseCSV',\r\n          ],\r\n          'message': 'parseCSV has been deprecated as of April 18 and will not be replaced.'\r\n        },\r\n      ],\r\n    }],\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor #2 above:\r\n```\r\n    'no-restricted-imports': [2, {\r\n      'paths': [\r\n        {\r\n          'name': '@someorg/api',\r\n          'importNames': [\r\n            'fetchThings',\r\n            'postThings',\r\n            'parseCSV',\r\n          ],\r\n          'messages': [\r\n            'fetchThings has been deprecated as of April 19, please use fetchWidgets instead.',\r\n            'postThings has been deprecated as of April 19, please use getWidgets instead.',\r\n            'parseCSV has been deprecated as of April 18 and will not be replaced.',\r\n          ]\r\n        },\r\n      ],\r\n    }],\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\nFor #1, only the last path in the list works, the others are ignored.\r\nFor #2, it breaks because messages is not recognized.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nIt will allow for specific messages per member so that the warning is specific to the member, providing better user/developer experience.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nI wish I was able to, but unfortunately don't have the bandwidth at the moment.  We rely on this tool for work and would really appreciate this change being implemented.  I will attempt it in a few months if not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/944785252","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14274#issuecomment-944785252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14274","id":944785252,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc44UEdk","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T22:33:29Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T22:33:29Z","body":"Oops!

What rule do you want to change?\n\nno-restricted-imports\n\n### What change to do you want to make?\n\nGenerate more warnings\n\n### How do you think the change should be implemented?\n\nOther\n\n### Example code\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  rules: {\r\n    'no-restricted-imports': [\r\n      'error',\r\n      {\r\n        patterns: [\r\n          {\r\n            group: ['emotion-theming', '@react-navigation/native'],\r\n            importNames: ['useTheme'], // The Change\r\n            message: \"Use 'useTheme' from the 'theme' module instead.\"\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\n```\n\n\n### What does the rule currently do for this code?\n\nIt's a change in the rule's options in eslint config. What I'm proposing is to add an `importNames` property for `patterns` same as we have in `paths`.\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to restrict the same import from multiple sources, you can accomplish that by providing separate objects for each source, but this way is redundant as you need to provide a name and a message each time.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n```\r\npaths: [\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'emotion-theming',\r\n    importNames: ['useTheme'],\r\n    message: \"Use 'useTheme' from the 'theme' module instead.\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: '@react-navigation/native',\r\n    importNames: ['useTheme'],\r\n    message: \"Use 'useTheme' from the 'theme' module instead.\",\r\n  },\r\n...\r\n],\r\n```\r\nWe could have:\r\n```\r\npatterns: [\r\n  {\r\n    group: ['emotion-theming', '@react-navigation/native', ...],\r\n    importNames: ['useTheme'],\r\n    message: \"Use 'useTheme' from the 'theme' module instead.\",\r\n  },\r\n],\r\n```\n\n### What will the rule do after it's changed?\n\nThe rule would work exactly the same, it's just an easier way of providing multiple sources of the same restricted import.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request to implement this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No

to ban references to Commons types in `@fluentui/react-components` index files.\r\n\r\nAlso don't require change files for modifications to `.eslintrc.*` (such as the one in react-components in this
