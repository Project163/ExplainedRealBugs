While I do realize that the `* 1` is unnecessary here, for readability of math expressions it is very valuable such as the example of working with `PI` but applies to any number multiplied by a fraction.\r\n\r\nI'd like a special case/exception made to the rule's checks that if the ` * 1` is immediately followed by a `/` then it is not an error.","closed_by":{"login":"snitin315","id":46647141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjQ3MTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46647141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315","html_url":"https://github.com/snitin315","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
