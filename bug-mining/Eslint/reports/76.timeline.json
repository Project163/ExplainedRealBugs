impression is that the team is generally not in favor of keeping the option, for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n* The option adds significant complexity to `espree`.\r\n* The option was experimental and was never intended to be a long-term feature.\r\n* In general, we don't have individual flags for syntax features.\r\n* The option adds significant complexity for rule authors, because there are several different AST representations for object rest/spread emitted by different parsers. Changing to the `ecmaVersion: 2018` behavior would simplify the situation.\r\n\r\nFor further discussion, see

According to [node.green](http://node.green/#ES2018), only the object spread and object rest spread features from es2018 are implemented. Therefore, it would be safer to declare `ecmaVersion: 2017` and enable `experimentalObjectRestSpread` in said projects. If didn't do so, using `for await of` would not cause any linting errors, but would fail when running the code.\r\n\r\nThis was just an example. There are a lot of other projects that are locked to `ecmaVersion < 2018` but use object rest/spread because they either use Node.js >= 8.6 or use Babel.\r\n\r\nPlease consider keeping `experimentalObjectRestSpread` for `ecmaVersion < 2018`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/383385465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"satazor","id":1017236,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTcyMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1017236?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor","html_url":"https://github.com/satazor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satazor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1587872050,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU4Nzg3MjA1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1587872050","actor":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-22T14:28:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1587872051,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1ODc4NzIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1587872051","actor":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-22T14:28:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
