realized I made a mistake when reading the [Node release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/643af71ee8365efbdccaa134690425ea05931279/README.md#release-schedule) -- the EOL date for Node 4 is April 30th, not April 1st. (I had accidentally been looking at the \"Maintenance LTS Start\" column rather than the \"End-of-life\" column.)\r\n\r\nIn [today's TSC meeting](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/db3c0010144ba403a95daf3611af24ee271b3c78/notes/2018/2018-03-01.md#planning-for-500-release), we decided to start doing prereleases for ESLint v5 on March 16th, but that decision was dependent on the assumption that the EOL date was April 1st. We might want to reevaluate that decision based on the corrected EOL date.\r\n\r\nI've added the \"tsc agenda\" label to this issue to make sure we discuss it by the next meeting, but I'm hoping we can make a decision sooner by discussing it on this issue, because if we do the first prerelease on March 16th, we will probably want to merge some breaking changes before March 15th (the date of the next meeting).\r\n\r\ncc

is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Bug fix ([template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eslint/eslint/master/templates/bug-report.md))\r\n\r\nFixes #9893.\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes false positives/negatives about ES2018 RegExp enhancements.\r\n\r\n- `no-control-regex` ... it didn't work if the platform doesn't support ES2018 natively. And I fixed some tests such as `` `var regex = ${/\\\\\\x1f\\\\x1e/}` `` since `\\\\x1e` is not a control character. It's four characters `\\` `x` `1` `e`, but the rule had reported it as a control character `\\x1e`.\r\n- `no-empty-character-class` ... it didn't work a RegExp literal has `s` flag.\r\n- `no-invalid-regexp` ... This rule had super confusion. Native ES2018 support had changed the rule's behavior because the rule had depended on native `RegExp` constructor. The rule had depended on `context.parserOptions` and `espree`, so it was confusing if it uses a custom parser. RegExp has many differences on syntax between with `u` flag and without `u` flag, but the rule didn't recognize it. I remove the access to `context.parserOptions`, so the rule validates RegExp with the latest syntax always. I think `allowConstructorFlags` option is no longer necessary. If the rule ignores flags which change syntax such as `u` flag, the rule cannot validate RegExp syntax properly.\r\n- `no-unexpected-multiline` ... it didn't work a RegExp literal has `s` flag.\r\n- `no-useless-escape` ... it had some false positives about Named Capturing Groups and Unicode Property Escapes.\r\n- `no-irregular-whitespace` ... it had `node.value instanceof RegExp`, but it doesn't work intentionally because `node.value` can be null if the platform doesn't support ES2018 natively.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n- Are there other rules which are related to ES2018 RegExp enhancements?\r\n- Because those are the same character, I'm not sure why the `no-control-regex` rule reports `\\x0A` but doesn't report `\\n`.  The original implementation looks to intend to report invisible characters. I wonder if I should remove the check of escape sequences from the `no-control-regexp` rule.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10062/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1526282766,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTUyNjI4Mjc2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1526282766","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-16T19:44:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1526282972,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1MjYyODI5NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1526282972","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8d3814e4ae823e58f40539047bb35bcaf5c76660","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/8d3814e4ae823e58f40539047bb35bcaf5c76660","created_at":"2018-03-16T19:44:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dependabot-preview[bot]","id":27856297,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjc4NTYyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot-preview","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-16T20:12:02Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T20:12:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yhirano55/ama/issues/57","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yhirano55/ama","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yhirano55/ama/issues/57/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yhirano55/ama/issues/57/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yhirano55/ama/issues/57/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yhirano55/ama/pull/57","id":306062063,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTc1NjM0ODAz","number":57,"title":"Bump
