for the issue!\r\n\r\nBy the [LintMessage](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api#-lintmessage-type) specification, `fix: EditInfo` is mandatory in `suggestions`, meaning that suggestion must provide a fix.\r\n\r\n`ReportTranslator` already [throws an error](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/1df7fa69967cc514a541c363eb52d845e1b1d8f0/lib/linter/report-translator.js#L284) if the suggestion object returned from the rule doesn't have `fix()` method, but it doesn't check the produced value.\r\n\r\nA bug fix would be to update `ReportTranslator` to throw if `fix()` returns `null`.\r\n\r\nThe rule should check upfront whether a fix is possible, and then just not return the whole suggestion object if the fix cannot be applied. In tests, asserting that there were no suggestions can be done with `suggestions: []` (or any falsy value instead of `[]`).\r\n\r\nHowever, returning `null` from a `fix()` method is well-known and widely used in core rules (although it seems to be undocumented?), so I think it would be reasonable to support that in suggestions, since it's a convenient way to put all the fixing logic in one place.\r\n\r\nIf `fix()` returns `null`, `ReportTranslator` could remove the whole suggestion from the array of suggestions.\r\n\r\n@DMartens just to verify, is that the expected

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nModified `ReportTranslator` to automatically remove the whole suggestion instance from the linting output if the suggestion's `fix` function returned `null` or an empty array/sequence.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n\r\nThis change prevents invalid lint messages.\r\n\r\nESLint API defines `Suggestion#fix` as a mandatory field in a [LintMessage](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api#-lintmessage-type). This means that all suggestions produced by the linting must include fixes. Integrations, following the spec, expect that this property exists and has a valid `EditInfo` value. For example, VSCode crashes if it is `null`.\r\n\r\n`ReportTranslator` already throws if the `fix` property in a suggestion object provided by the rule isn't a `function`, but it wasn't checking the value returned from that function. \r\n\r\nIt's still allowed to `return null` or `return []` from `fix()`, or yield nothing from `*fix()`, as an indicator that suggestion's fix cannot be applied. This is a commonly used pattern in auto-fix `fix` functions (e.g., when it finds out that some comments in the code are interfering with the fix).\r\n\r\nAfter this change, instead of creating an invalid suggestion object with `fix: null`, the whole suggestion will be removed from the final output. If there are multiple suggestions for the same error, only those that didn't provide a fix will be removed.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3916066330,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzkxNjA2NjMzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3916066330","actor":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-23T23:40:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3916066376,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5MTYwNjYzNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3916066376","actor":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bfddcedace5587d662c840c2edf33062b54a178e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/bfddcedace5587d662c840c2edf33062b54a178e","created_at":"2020-10-23T23:40:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4627897730,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50NDYyNzg5NzczMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/4627897730","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-22T00:44:32Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4627897769,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ2Mjc4OTc3Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/4627897769","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bb
