for duplicates. During validation, the internal function checkDuplicateTestCase() is called, which in turn uses the isSerializable() function for serialization checks. When a circular reference object is passed in, isSerializable() enters infinite recursion, ultimately causing a stack overflow.\n\nOn the testing side, ESLint's serialization tests completely omit circular reference scenarios. The test suite only covers basic cases (primitive types, null values, arrays), but fails to test crucial edge cases. There are no checks for recursion depth or circular structures. This lack of defensive programming in the implementation, combined with insufficient test coverage, allows this internal module vulnerability to be exploited through a public API.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2829750567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lyyffee","id":144524010,"node_id":"U_kgDOCJ1C6g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144524010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee","html_url":"https://github.com/lyyffee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyyffee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17416059453,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAKjKDc6zalwazwAAAAQOE_o9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/17416059453","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-26T12:27:03Z","label":{"name":"needs

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nUpdated `isSerializable` (`lib/shared/serialization.js`) to not cause a stack overflow error when the passed object has circular references, and in that case return `false` because objects with circular references are not JSON-serializable.\r\n\r\nAlso updated `freezeDeeply` (in `lib/rule-tester/rule-tester.js`) to to not cause a stack overflow error when the passed object has circular references.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nThis is a very edge case, so I was more concerned if it would affect performance. By my performance testing, which was to run all core rules tests, it doesn't seem to significantly affect execution time.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time node node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha -R min
