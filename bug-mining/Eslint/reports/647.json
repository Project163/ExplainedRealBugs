A minimal version of the command I'm running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx eslint --no-eslintrc \\\r\n    --parser '@typescript-eslint/parser' \\\r\n    --plugin 'import' \\\r\n    --plugin 'unused-imports' \\\r\n    --rule 'unused-imports/no-unused-imports: [error]' \\\r\n    --rule 'import/order: [error, {alphabetize: {order: asc, caseInsensitive: true}}]' \\\r\n    --fix \\\r\n    $IMPORT_FILES\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter migrating to flat config, this command fails and tells me to switch to `--no-config-lookup` instead of `--no-eslintrc`. When I make the change, it still fails with \"File ignored because of a matching ignore pattern.\", likely because of https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18263.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm using in the meantime is to prepend the old command with ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nAfter switching to `--no-config-lookup`, the command continues to work.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\n```\r\n  0:0  warning  File ignored because of a matching ignore pattern. Use \"--no-ignore\" to disable file ignore settings or use \"--no-warn-ignored\" to suppress this warning\r\n\r\n✖ 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)\r\n```\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\n\nSee above\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"JavaScriptBach","id":4206366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDYzNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4206366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach","html_url":"https://github.com/JavaScriptBach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaScriptBach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
