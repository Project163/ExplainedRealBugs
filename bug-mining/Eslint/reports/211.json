After this is fixed:\r\n```js\r\nif (foo)\r\n  const bar = 'baz';\r\n```\r\nit outputs the error \"Parsing error: Unexpected token const\" as lexical declarations need to be in a block.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nThe `multi-or-nest` option would allow the code and not output any errors.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nI would if I could, but I'm not great at coding.","closed_by":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
