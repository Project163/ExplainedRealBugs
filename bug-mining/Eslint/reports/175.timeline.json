Sorry for letting this slide. Could you please provide an example of how this would benefit end users or plugin developers? E.g., would it somehow allow options to be automatically hydrated?\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAlso, going back to my earlier comments, I've thought about this some more and I think I remember that property names such as \"default\" tend to be in `properties` or `elements` objects within an object or array schema definition-- that is, default-as-a-keyword should be outside of those elements so there should be no collision. So I'm less concerned about a breaking change possibility here.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/420735122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1841770203,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg0MTc3MDIwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1841770203","actor":{"login":"sindresorhus","id":170270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDI3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus","html_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T17:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1841770204,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NDE3NzAyMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1841770204","actor":{"login":"sindresorhus","id":170270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDI3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus","html_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T17:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/420755087","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9929#issuecomment-420755087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9929","id":420755087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc1NTA4Nw==","user":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_event

This would potentially benefit us as well as integrations developers. For example, currently for `semi` rule, `always` is a default option. It's not marked anywhere as a default, and the only way to figure this out is either through documentation, or by reading the code. However, if we were to use `default` property, you could also figure that out through schema. More than that, we could write generic code that would run before the rule executes that would set all of the defaults up, if configuration doesn't specify anything. That way, we could possibly remove a bunch of code from our rules that handles setting defaults now.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/420755087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1841903607,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg0MTkwMzYwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1841903607","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T18:41:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1841903608,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NDE5MDM2MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1841903608","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T18:41:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/420758740","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9929#issuecomment-420758740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9929","id":420758740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc1ODc0MA==","user":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plati

Summary**:\r\n\r\nJSON Schema supports a \"default\" keyword which allows schema authors to specify default values for optional properties in an object schema (among other cases). By allowing schemas to have defaults (a 1-line change in the ajv wrapper code), both core rules and custom rules could have default values in schemas.\r\n\r\nAdditionally (although maybe as a separate proposal), we could write some generic code when creating rule instances which would hydrate default values for any rule options not provided by the user, which would allow us to remove some code in all rules related to option defaults.
