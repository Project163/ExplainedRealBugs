I have to use \r\n```js\r\n// eslint-disable-next-line\r\ndebugger\r\n```\r\nconstruction and I already have debugger statement slipped into production code at least twice.\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented? (New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nPlease remove the fixer completely or make it optional. I've read the comment https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/8660#issuecomment-315806299 and I still think that for no-debugger rule fixer is kind of useless. You'll never have more that one or two accidentally forgotten statements to force IDE creators to implement such mechanism.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10242/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":6,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
