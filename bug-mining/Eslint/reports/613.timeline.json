This is problematic with respect to the [language plugins `SourceCode#traverse()`](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/main/designs/2022-languages/README.md#the-sourecodetraverse-method), which allows for a traversal to happen at any point and returns an array of steps to complete the traversal. The data available at each step should be the same as when there's an active traversal, but that doesn't happen with code path analysis due to the `CodePath` objects exposing state information.\r\n\r\nI don't fully understand the problem. Do you have an implementation of `SourceCode#traverse` that doesn't work as expected because of `CodePath#currentSegments`? That would help a lot in clarifying the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> ```js\r\n> const codePathSegments = [];\r\n> let currentCodePathSegments = [];\r\n> \r\n> return {\r\n>             onCodePathStart() {\r\n>                 codePathSegments.push(currentCodePathSegments);\r\n>                 currentCodePathSegments = [];\r\n>             },\r\n>             onCodePathSegmentStart(segment) {\r\n>                 currentCodePathSegments.push(segment);\r\n>             },\r\n>             onCodePathSegmentEnd() {\r\n>                 currentCodePathSegments.pop();\r\n>             },\r\n>             onCodePathEnd() {\r\n>                 currentCodePathSegments = codePathSegments.pop();\r\n>             },\r\n> };\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI believe this won't work for rules that need to know whether the currently traversed code is reachable, because `onCodePathSegmentStart`/`onCodePathSegmentEnd` [doesn't fire for unreachable segments](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/9d4216d638d39844decffac33ee3d5a47413c80a/lib/linter/code-path-analysis/code-path-analyzer.js#L219).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1689729204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1690092365","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17457#issuecomment-1690092365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17457","id":1690092365,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5kvMNN","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-23T14:41:42Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T14:41:42Z","body":"I just pushed the updated code.\r\n\r\n> I believe this won't work for rules that need to know whether the currently traversed code is reachable, because onCodePathSegmentStart/onCodePathSegmentEnd [doesn't fire for unreachable segments](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/9d4216d638d39844decffac33ee3d5a47413c80a/lib/linter/code-path-analysis/code-path-analyzer.js#L219).\r\n\r\nGood point.
