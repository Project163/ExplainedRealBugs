at Stage 4.

[Literal](https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/es5.md#literal) has `RegExp` value and `RegExpLiteral` extends only `regex` property.\r\n- [EDIT] ~~I represented Dynamic Imports as `CallExpression` as same as the current experimental spec. However, I think that another way such as `ImportExpression` is better: https://github.com/estree/estree/issues/197. Thoughts?~~ I changed the AST of Dynamic Imports because of #197. I believe that the `Import` node way will confuse us in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #197, fixes #169, closes
