at @jakebailey's reactions to this issue and the discussion, it appears that the feedback to this approach is positive, but I'll leave it up to him / DT to respond.\r\n\r\nOutside of DT, there is also positive feedback to this change too 👍

wasn't expecting you all to want to change your tune on configs needing to be executable; it'd be bringing back all of the same funky resolution stuff. So, I viewed just the option to use .mjs everywhere as \"good enough\" to solve things.\r\n\r\nI will note that I have not had time to attempt to convert DT to flat config, so I have not tried out the \"one single config at the top that parses the 2000 eslintrc.json files\" idea. Theoretically that would \"fix\" things without requiring any change to eslint, but I suspect that it will not be performant.\r\n\r\nI also think that the benefit of this change extends beyond DT by arguments similar to mine; a slight amount of complexity increase here will lead to a much lower amount of complexity elsewhere thanks to stuff like no longer needing to configure every editor to use a .mjs config file (and also, _help_ make ESM eslint plugins more usable across more projects).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1858864092/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jakebailey","id":5341706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDE3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5341706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey","html_url":"https://github.com/jakebailey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jakebailey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11266544359,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc552rOMzwAAAAKfidLn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/11266544359","actor":{"login":"beaussan","id":7281023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODEwMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7281023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan","html_url":"https://github.com/beaussan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beaussan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-16T20:06:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Zamiell","id":5511220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTEyMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5511220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell","html_url":"https://github.com/Zamiell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-17T14:07:37Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T14:07:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpro-nl/knip/issues/182","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpro-nl/knip","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpro-nl/knip/issues/182/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpro-nl/knip/issues/182/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpro-nl/knip/issues/182/events","html_url":"https://github.com/webpro-nl/knip/issues/182","id":1831595545,"node_id":"I_kwDOIIPL1M5tK-4Z","number":182,"title":"feature

First of all, it is common to name `.ts` and `.js` files with an extension according to whether or not the file is CommonJS / ESM. Meaning that `knip` should support:\r\n\r\n- knip.mts\r\n- knip.cts\r\n- knip.mjs\r\n- knip.cjs\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think that Knip should follow the style of the existing tools in the ecosystem. Most notably, ESLint has a config file of `eslint.config.js` and Prettier has a config file of `prettier.config.mjs` and Jest has a config file of `jest.config.mjs`. So, I think Knip should support:\r\n\r\n- knip.config.ts\r\n- knip.config.mts\r\n- knip.config.cts\r\n- knip.conifg.js\r\n- knip.config.mjs\r\n- knip.config.cjs\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the docs should actively recommend that people use this config file naming format so that we match the rest of the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, note that this is more than a semantic or stylistic issue. TypeScript throws errors for a `knip.ts` when it is inside of a CommonJS project. Renaming the file to `knip.mts` fixes the problem, but then `knip` no longer picks up the file. ~~So this is a blocker.~~ (This can be worked around with the `--config` flag.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpro-nl/knip/issues/182/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpro-nl/knip/issues/182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fisker","id":172584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjU4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker","html_url":"https://github.com/fisker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-20T12:38:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T12:38:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/issues/1886","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/issues/1886/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/issues/1886/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/issues/1886/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/pull/1886","id":1368540748,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA1Pus84-txgG","number":1886,"title":"Support
