you for your report.\r\n\r\nIndeed, documentation is not enough.\r\n\r\nThe logic to ignore files has quirks for historical reason. I don't know the reason, but I found some quirks while I implemented https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/11546 and https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12274. The following list is it.\r\n\r\n- ESLint ignores `/node_modules/*`, `/bower_components/*`, and dotfiles by default.\r\n- If a path is a glob pattern or a directory path rather than a file path, and the path starts with `.` or contains `/.`, then ESLint doesn't ignore dotfiles.\r\n- If `--no-ignore` is present, ESLint ignores `--ignore-path`, `--ignore-pattern`, and `.eslintignore`. This means ESLint ignores the files which match the default ignore patterns.\r\n- But if `--no-ignore` is present, and a path is a file path rather than a glob pattern nor a directory path, then ESLint doesn't ignore the file even if the path matches the default ignore patterns.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd like to recommend to configure to unignore dotfiles you want because ignoring dotfiles is essential behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#

Also, the [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#ignored-file-warnings) says\r\n\r\n> File ignored because of your .eslintignore file.

The regular expression for detecting a dotfile was expanded to look for a dotfile in any part of the path rather than just the end of the path. Additionally, documentation that explains the nuances of the implicit ignore rules and a test for the new behavior introduced in this pull request have been added.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\nNone in particular.
