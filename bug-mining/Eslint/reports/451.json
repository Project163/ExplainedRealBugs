On each of those occasions it's been closed automatically without any interest. But those just asked for the new behavior without really explaining why.\r\n\r\nI want to make a case the proposed change is **the right behavior**. The `fallthrough` comment is intended to replace a `break`, which means that a reader of the code will be looking for it where they would expect to find the `break`. And the convention when using a braced `case` is that the `break` occurs _within_ the braces, not outside of it. So that is where a reader should expect to find the comment, not (as eslint currently requires) _after_ the braces. The placement required by the current rule actually makes the comment easier to miss.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
