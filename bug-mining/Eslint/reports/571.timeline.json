I could work around the issue with a [runtime plugin](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-2/#from---rulesdir-to-runtime-plugins). \r\nThe initial problem:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Prior (non flat config) -----------------------------------\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  extends: [\"plugin:jsonc/recommended-with-jsonc\"],\r\n  parser: \"@babel/eslint-parser\",\r\n  overrides: [\r\n    {\r\n      files: [\"*.json\", \"*.json5\", \"*.jsonc\"],\r\n      parser: \"jsonc-eslint-parser\",\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Flat config ------------------------------------------------\r\nimport jsonc from \"eslint-plugin-jsonc\";\r\n\r\nexport default [{\r\n  files:   [\"**/*.json\", \"**/*.jsonc\", \"**/*.json5\"],\r\n  plugins: {\r\n    jsonc\r\n  },\r\n  languageOptions: {\r\n     parser: 'jsonc/jsonc-eslint-parser' // <- Error because jsonc.parsers['jsonc-eslint-parser'] does not exists\r\n  },\r\n  rules: {...}\r\n}];\r\n```\r\nThe initial idea to bypass the `parser`[ as object](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-2/#custom-parsers-and-parser-options-are-mostly-the-same) failed because of this issue:\r\n```js\r\n  languageOptions: {\r\n     parser: await import('jsonc-eslint-parser') // <- Error must be string. Object not implemented yet\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nTo work aroud this, I defined a runtime plugin of the same name `'jsonc'` and made the `parser` available under the `'parsers'` prop: `[Plugin_Name].parsers.[Parser_Name]`. No need to change `languageOptions.parser` to an object any more:\r\n```js\r\nimport {default as jsonc, parseForESLint, configs} from \"eslint-plugin-jsonc\";\r\n\r\nconst parsers = {\r\n  'jsonc-eslint-parser': {\r\n    parseForESLint\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default [{\r\n  files:   [\"**/*.json\", \"**/*.jsonc\", \"**/*.json5\"],\r\n  plugins: {\r\n    jsonc: { ...jsonc, parsers}\r\n    /* same as\r\n    jsonc: {\r\n      parsers: {\r\n        'jsonc-eslint-parser': {\r\n          parseForESLint\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    } */\r\n  },\r\n  languageOptions: {\r\n     parser: 'jsonc/jsonc-eslint-parser'\r\n  },\r\n  rules: {...}\r\n}];\r\n```\r\nNot sure if this is a valid approach, but it seems to work so far.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1426594123/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"exodus4d","id":9299033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTkwMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9299033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d","html_url":"https://github.com/exodus4d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exodus4d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8565406068,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAKjKDc5d6L3azwAAAAH-ibl0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/8565406068","actor":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-20T22:43:45Z","label":{"name":"tsc agenda","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1437641483","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16875#issuecomment-1437641483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16875","id":1437641483,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5VsKsL","user":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-20T22:45:36Z","updated_at":"2023-02-20T22:54:24Z","body":"Great that you found a workaround!

Update ESLint to use `@eslint/eslintrc`\n- [x] Remove in-memory filesystem from tests\n- [x] Update `CLIEngine` to use `CascadingConfigArrayFactory` from `@eslint/eslintrc`\n\n## Phase 2: Implement flat config with `eslintrc` compatibility\n\n- [x] Create the `FlatCompat` class in `eslint/eslintrc` repository\n- [x] Create `FlatConfigArray` to represent simple configs\n- [x] Update `Linter` class to understand `FlatConfigArray` objects\n- [x] Ensure `Linter#defineRule` and `Linter#definePlugin` throw errors when using `FlatConfigArray`\n- [x] Add `context.languageOptions` in backwards-compatible way to `context` in `Linter`\n- [x] Ensure `context.parserPath` still works in `Linter` for `FlatConfigArray` (for now)\n- [x] Create `FlatRuleTester` to allow rule testing with `FlatConfigArray` format\n- [x] Create `FlatESLint` class to mirror `ESLint` class but use `eslint.config.js` instead\n- [x] #15661\n- [x] #15683\n- [x] #15687\n- [x] Implement caching\n- [x] Update `cli.js` to search for `eslint.config.js` file and use `FlatESLint` if found (`ESLint` if not)\n- [x] Ensure invalid CLI flags cause errors when using flat config (for example, `--resolve-plugins-relative-to`)\n- [x] Switch `eslint/eslint` repo to use flat config\n- [x] Document flat config\n- [x] Release ESLint with `eslintrc` compatibility\n- [x] #16416\n- [x] #16415\n- [x] #16414 \n- [x] #16413 \n- [x] #16410 \n- [x] #16402 \n- [x] #16341 \n- [x] #16340 \n- [x] #16299 \n- [x] #16275 \n- [x] #16265 \n- [x] #16264\n- [x] #16537\n- [x] #16875\n\n## Phase 3: Compatibility testing\n\n- [ ] Work with `typescript-eslint` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/6836))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-import` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2829 https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2873\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-config-airbnb` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic)\n- [x] Work with `eslint-config-standard` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/pull/277)]\n- [x] Work with `eslint-plugin-n` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n/pull/95))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-vue` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/pull/2226))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-react` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/pull/3600))\n- [x] Switch ESLint config to load external configs/plugins without `FlatCompat`\n- [x] Release ESLint with extended compatibility\n\n## Phase 4: General availability (v9.0.0)\n\n- [x] Write blog post about flat config format\n- [x] Output warning when people use `eslintrc` files\n- [x] Switch documentation so `eslint.config.js` is the default and recommended format (link to legacy `eslintrc` docs from the same page)\n- [x] Switch `Linter` to use flat config by default\n- [x] Switch documentation for shareable configs to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] Switch documentation for plugins to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] #14308\n- [x] Rename `ESLint` class to `LegacyESLint` and rename `FlatESLint` to `ESLint`\n- [x] Delete `RuleTester` class and rename `FlatRuleTester` to `RuleTester`\n- [x] Update `api.js` to export new values for `ESLint` and `RuleTester`\n- [x] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to return `true` except if `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` is `false`.\n- [x] Release ESLint with GA flat config\n\n## Phase 5: Remove `eslintrc` (v10.0.0)\n\n- [ ] Remove old CLI flags\n- [ ] Remove `context.parserPath`, `context.parserOptions`, `context.globals` in `Linter` (#20086, eslint/rewrite#263)\n- [ ] Remove `configType` constructor option for `Linter`; throw error if found.\n- [ ] Report an error when `eslint-env` config comment is used (#20128)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` support (#20037)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` documentation\n- [ ] Delete `FlatESLint` class\n- [ ] Delete `LegacyESLint` class\n- [ ] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to always return `true` \n- [ ] Release ESLint without `eslintrc`

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nThis implements a check for a 'meta' key on parsers and processors that contains information to help flat config serialize these objects for use with caching and also --print-config on the command line.\r\n\r\nI also allowed the `name` and `version` properties at the top level of parsers and processors because some parsers, [including Espree](https://github.com/eslint/espree/blob/main/espree.js#L141), already export a `version` property at the top level.
