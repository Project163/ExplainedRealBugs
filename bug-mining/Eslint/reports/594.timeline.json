Environment\r\n\r\nNode version: v20.7.0\r\nnpm version: v10.1.0\r\nLocal ESLint version: v8.50.0 (Currently used)\r\nGlobal ESLint version: Not found\r\nOperating System: win32 10.0.19045\r\n\r\n### What parser are you using?\r\n\r\nDefault (Espree)\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\nI updated the `no-undef` rule to throw an error on the first file it gets. Then I ran `npx eslint .` \r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nESLint to print the error and then finish right after.\r\n\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n\r\nESLint prints the error, but after that it takes 20 seconds for the command prompt to appear again because ESLint keeps linting other files after the error is thrown. This seems unnecessary as it will not change the outcome.\r\n\r\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit fetch origin\r\ngit checkout origin/issue17621-repro\r\nnpx eslint .\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nI believe this happens because all tasks have already been added to the queue. If we want to fix this behavior, the change would probably be in this part of the code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/dd79abc0c1857b1d765acc312c0d6518e40d31c9/lib/eslint/flat-eslint.js#L785-L879\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
