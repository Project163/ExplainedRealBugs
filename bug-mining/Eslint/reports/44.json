Many thanks for a great tool :-)\r\n\r\nI was trying to work out from the docs, which options take precedence in the following example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Some tool\r\nvar CLIEngine = require(\"eslint\").CLIEngine;\r\n\r\nvar cli = new CLIEngine({\r\n    // ...\r\n    useEslintrc: true,\r\n    rules: {\r\n        semi: \"error\"\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// .eslintrc\r\n{\r\n    \"rules\": {\r\n        \"semi\": \"off\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [CLIEngine](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api#cliengine) docs just say:\r\n> useEslintrc - Set to false to disable use of .eslintrc files (default: true). Corresponds to --no-eslintrc.\r\n\r\nAnd the docs on [configuration hierarchy/precedence](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-cascading-and-hierarchy) don't mention `CLIEngine` at all:\r\n\r\n> The complete configuration hierarchy, from highest precedence to lowest precedence, is as follows:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Inline configuration\r\n>     1. `/*eslint-disable*/` and `/*eslint-enable*/`\r\n>     1. `/*global*/`\r\n>     1. `/*eslint*/`\r\n>     1. `/*eslint-env*/`\r\n> 2. Command line options:\r\n>     1. `--global`\r\n>     1. `--rule`\r\n>     1. `--env`\r\n>     1. `-c`, `--config`\r\n> 3. Project-level configuration:\r\n>     1. `.eslintrc.*` or `package.json` file in same directory as linted file\r\n>     1. Continue searching for `.eslintrc` and `package.json` files in ancestor directories (parent has highest precedence, then grandparent, etc.), up to and including the root directory or until a config with `\"root\": true` is found.\r\n>     1. In the absence of any configuration from (1) thru (3), fall back to a personal default configuration in  `~/.eslintrc`.\r\n\r\nFrom experimentation, I've found that the options passed to `CLIEngine` take priority over the ones in `.eslintrc`, however I think it would be good to document this.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to open a PR to do so, but it would be useful to know whether I should do so on the configuration page, the API page, or both?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
