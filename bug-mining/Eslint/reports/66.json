Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\nIt complained in the closure.\r\n\r\nWhen you change `ready` to a loop-invariant variable (like `i`), the warning disappears. Note that in this reduced case (as well as my actual code), the closed-over variable being referenced outside the scope is provably loop-invariant outside the nested callback itself (and thus avoids the usual issues), even though it *is* modified in child scopes, and this *can* be discerned without the use of abstract evaluation. (Technically, abstract evaluation would just obliterate it entirely.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNote: it is out of the scope of this bug whether to allow code like this, where `ready` is *not* loop-invariant:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"use strict\";\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n\tlet create = () => {}\r\n\tlet values = []\r\n\tlet ready\r\n\t\r\n\tfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\r\n\t\tcreate(() => {\r\n\t\t\tvalues = ready\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t\tready = i\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn () => {\r\n\t\tready = 10\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9527/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
