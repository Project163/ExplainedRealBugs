(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nNew option: `ignoreImports`: `true`/`false`, `default`: Debatable. I would say `true` by default because if the code is in your control, eslint would then only flag the declaration and not where it's imported.\r\nCould possibly accept a string/regexp array to only ignore certain modules.\r\n\r\nExisting option: `allow` (string/regexp array) somehow check these against the module token of an import (ex: `import { SomeType } from \"react\"` -> \"react\") rather than a check on the variable itself. For generated codes/types/etc this will not work well.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nimport { Some_apolloGenerated_Type } from \"./__generated__/graphql-types.ts\"; // generated code from apollo codegen\r\n```\r\nThis could be aliased but this code is generated so it's basically futile. Plus it would be hard to come up with aliases for types corresponding to graphql queries/results and their inner types.\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\nFlags generated types from apollo code gen as violating the rule. These types are dynamically generated based on graphql queries which is the reason for a mix of underscores and camel casing.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\nIgnore imports, either selectively or fully.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nNo","closed_by":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12527/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12527/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
