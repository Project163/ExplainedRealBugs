(Give an overview)\r\n\r\n1. Removed `!isParenthesisedTwice(node.body)` for fixing #12717.\r\n   - It will make this rule to ignore checking \"double extra parens\" if the option (`enforceForNewInMemberExpressions : false`) is specified.\r\n\r\n2. Added some tests for checks whether they ignore \"double extra parens\" when the option is specified.\r\n   - Other options which not added test in this PR already have test cases ensuring it.\r\n   - returnAssign, nestedBinaryExpressions, enforceForSequenceExpressions, enforceForNewInMemberExpressions.\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, an arrow function's block statement body can't be parenthesized`()`, because it will change the body's type `BlockStatement` to `ObjectExpression`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar a = () => {  }; // BlockStatement\r\nvar a = () => ({ }); // ObjectExpression\r\n```\r\nAnd there is a checking about \"double extra parens\" when body type is not a `BlockStatement`.\r\n```\r\nif (node.body.type !== \"BlockStatement\") {\r\n   // ...\r\n    if (hasExcessParensWithPrecedence()) { \r\n \r\n   }\r\n   // ...\r\n```\r\nSo, I think `!isParenthesisedTwice(node.body)` can be removed without another
