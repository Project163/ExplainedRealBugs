(line 2)\r\n\r\nGiven that this rule reports all references to non-camelcased variables, this behavior is actually logical.\r\n\r\nIn `var { some_property } = obj`, shorthand `some_property` is a property name used to read property value (which is always allowed by this rule) and a variable name in destructuring pattern (which is allowed by `\"ignoreDestructuring\": true`).\r\n\r\nIn `doSomething({ some_property })`, shorthand `some_property` is a property name used to create property (which is allowed by `\"properties\": \"never\"`) and a variable name. It is reported as a variable name (a reference to the variable). because this isn't a destructuring pattern, so `\"ignoreDestructuring\": true` doesn't apply here.\r\n\r\n> This is working as intended until v7.32.0\r\n> Not working since 8.0.0 release.\r\n\r\nIt seems that ESLint v7.32.0 had a bug - `\"properties\": \"never\"` should allow property names, but this option was mistakenly allowing all child nodes of Property nodes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ESLint v7.32.0\r\n\r\n/* eslint camelcase: [\"error\", { ignoreDestructuring: true, properties: \"never\" }] */\r\n\r\nconst foo_bar = 5; // reported.\r\n\r\nfoo_bar; // reported as a reference to variable.\r\n\r\nconst obj = {\r\n    a: foo_bar, // not reported. It's a bug because this is a reference to variable, not a property name.\r\n    [foo_bar]: 6, // not reported. It's a bug because this is a reference to variable, not a property name.\r\n    foo_bar,  // not reported. It's a bug because this is both a reference to variable and a property name.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug has been fixed in ESLint v8:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ESLint v8.8.0\r\n\r\n/* eslint camelcase: [\"error\", { ignoreDestructuring: true, properties: \"never\" }] */\r\n\r\nconst foo_bar = 5; // reported.\r\n\r\nfoo_bar; // reported as a reference to variable.\r\n\r\nconst obj = {\r\n    a: foo_bar, // reported as a reference to variable.\r\n    [foo_bar]: 6, // reported as a reference to variable.\r\n    foo_bar,  // reported as a reference to variable.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, the example from the original post was one of the two primary use cases for `ignoreDestructuring` option, so I agree that we should change the rule to allow this example for backward compatibility, although the current behavior makes more sense.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1031713714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6026051561,"node_id":"LE_lADOAKjKDc5C9sZ4zwAAAAFnLj_p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6026051561","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-08T11:28:16Z","label":{"name":"rule","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6074192326,"node_id":"CE_lADOAKjKDc5C9sZ4zwAAAAFqDNHG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6074192326","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-15T11:31:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6074193545,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc5C9sZ4zwAAAAFqDNaJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6074193545","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id"
