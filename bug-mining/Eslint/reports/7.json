Please include the actual source code causing the issue.**\r\n\r\nI linted an invalid piece of JavaScript text which only consists of a single dot: `.`\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ echo '.' | eslint --stdin --no-eslintrc\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\n\r\nI expected a parser error including the message `Unexpected token .`\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\n```\r\n<text>\r\n  1:1  error  Parsing error: Unexpected token\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `stylish` and `codeframe` formatters strip trailing `.` characters from report messages, presumably for stylistic reasons. However, this leads to confusing messages when the `.` is actually an important component of the message, rather than a period at the end of the sentence.\r\n\r\nOne way to address this would be to avoid removing the trailing `.` for `fatal` messages. Another solution would be to just stop removing trailing `.` characters entirely.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9154/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
