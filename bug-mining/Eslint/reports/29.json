It would be nice at least to have an option to `no-var` like `ignore-global` or something like that to prevent breaking of such code.","closed_by":{"login":"gyandeeps","id":5554486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTQ0ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5554486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps","html_url":"https://github.com/gyandeeps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
