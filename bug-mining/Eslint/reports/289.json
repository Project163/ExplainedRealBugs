If you have any questions, please stop by our chatroom: https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint\r\n\r\n    Note that leaving sections blank will make it difficult for us to troubleshoot and we may have to close the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Please describe what the rule should do:**\r\n\r\nES2016 adds an exponentiation operator `**`; this may be preferred over using `Math.pow()`. The rule should disallow the use of the `Math.pow()` function, in favor of using `**`.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[ ] Enforces code style\r\n[ ] Warns about a potential error\r\n[x] Suggests an alternate way of doing something\r\n[ ] Other (please specify:)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n// Good\r\nconst a = 5 ** 7\r\n\r\n// Bad\r\nconst a = Math.pow(5, 7)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nThis is a ES2016 feature, which can replace an older way of doing things. There should be a rule to force upgrading code; similar to how ESLint has `no-var`, `prefer-spread`, etc.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10482/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
