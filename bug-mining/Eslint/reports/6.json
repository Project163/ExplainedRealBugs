Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\nNo error was reported, because ESLint considered the shebang to be a valid `eslint-disable-next-line` comment.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the issue is occurring as part of the inline comment processing [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/3c41a053026b502bc8ec3890e526f45129c84ebd/lib/linter.js#L339-L399). In a previous version of ESLint, `ast.comments` did not contain shebangs, so it was safe for that logic to assume that all comments in the array had a type of either `Block` or `Line`. However, `ast.comments` now includes shebang comments (they have type `Shebang`), so this is no longer a safe assumption.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways that this could be fixed:\r\n\r\n* Filter out shebangs before doing any processing on them.\r\n* Make the logic explicitly check that a comment has type `Line` before assuming that it's a line comment.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
