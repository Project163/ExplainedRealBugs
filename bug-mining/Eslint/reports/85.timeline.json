I'm not sure about other `ignore***` options.\r\n\r\nI think the default behavior of `max-len` should be to enforce a maximum line length, without any caveats. Changing this seems like it would violate the [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). (It's not always the case that users want to ignore RegExp literals -- for some projects the solution to a long regex would either be \"simplify it to make it shorter\" or \"use the `RegExp` constructor on concatenated string literals.)\r\n\r\n> - https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-self-assign \"props\": true?\r\n\r\n:+1:\r\n\r\n> - https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-undef \"typeof\": true?

It's pretty common for code to do something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (typeof possiblyExistingGlobal !== 'undefined') {\r\n  doSomethingWith(possiblyExistingGlobal);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case it doesn't make sense to specify `possiblyExistingGlobal` as a global in configuration, because the user would still want to disallow it outside of blocks that are guarded with a check for its existence. It seems like it would be annoying to add an `eslint-disable` comment for every `if` statement like this.* Given that most ESLint users use `no-undef`, I'm leaning towards not wanting to change this default because it would cause a lot of ecosystem churn from false positives.\r\n\r\n*Currently, it's necessary to use an `eslint-disable` comment anyway for every use of `possiblyExistingGlobal` inside the block. I think we should fix this (there have been a few proposals about it in the past), but it's a separate issue.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/385137259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/385137476","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10215#issuecomment-385137476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10215","id":385137476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTEzNzQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-28T03:47:23Z","updated_at":"2018-04-28T03:47:23Z","body":">

[2](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/65d97c96aa59517f90c34bf5a6b962e1b5e42316/test/parallel/test-buffer-writeint.js#L10-L11), [3](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/65d97c96aa59517f90c34bf5a6b962e1b5e42316/test/pummel/test-crypto-dh.js#L42-L43), [4](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/65d97c96aa59517f90c34bf5a6b962e1b5e42316/test/pummel/test-crypto-dh.js#L51-L52)\r\n\r\nOpinions clearly vary about whether this style is appealing. Still, I think configuring something like `max-len: [error, 80]`, the user is telling ESLint that they would like their line length to be capped at 80. Maybe this isn't actually what the user wants, but I don't think ESLint should silently override what the user said and enforce something different. If it turns out that the user wanted to ignore regex literals, they'll find out soon enough when an error is reported, and they can change their config.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the user expectation in this case is different from the expectation when ESLint chooses defaults for most other rules, because the idea of enforcing a maximum line length is very simple. The user probably has a very clear idea of what they're trying to enforce when configuring `max-len`, in contrast to other rules where the user probably hasn't considered all the cases that the rule needs to deal with.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/385138830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1600429445,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MDA0Mjk0NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1600429445","actor":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-29T08:03:39Z","label":{"name":"breaking","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1620560818,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MjA1NjA4MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1620560818","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-10T19:51:24Z","label":{"name":"tsc
