If you are here for another reason, please see below:\r\n\r\n    1. To report a bug: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/reporting-bugs\r\n    2. To propose a new rule: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/new-rules\r\n    3. To request a change that is not a bug fix, rule change, or new rule: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/changes\r\n    4. If you have any questions, please stop by our chatroom: https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint\r\n\r\n    Note that leaving sections blank will make it difficult for us to troubleshoot and we may have to close the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What rule do you want to change?**\r\n\r\n`camelcase`, `capitalized-comments`, `default-case`, `dot-notation`, `handle-callback-err`, `id-match`, `line-comment-position`, `lines-around-comment`, `max-len`, `new-cap`, `no-fallthrough`, `no-unused-vars`, `spaced-comment` and `valid-jsdoc`. (These are all of the rules that have options which are interpreted as regular expressions.)\r\n\r\n**Does this change cause the rule to produce more or fewer warnings?**\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, the behavior would be the same. In cases where the source text contains astral symbols or other non-BMP characters, the rule may produce more or fewer warnings.\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented? (New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nThis will be a new default behavior. I think this is the behavior that most users expect anyway, although they might not have noticed that the current behavior is different from their expectation.\r\n\r\n[This page](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-unicode-regex) contains a good summary of unicode regexes.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint max-len: [\r\n  error,\r\n  25,\r\n  {ignorePattern: \"𝌆{2}\"}\r\n] */\r\n\r\nvar longNameLongNameLongName = '𝌆𝌆';\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nThe rule reports an error on the line with a variable declaration, even though it seems like that line should match the `ignorePattern`.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\nThe rule will no longer report an error, because it will interpret the ignore pattern as a unicode regex.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11423/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
