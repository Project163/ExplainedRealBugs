JavaScript doesn't handle it as a character, so the character class matches to U+2747 or U+FE0F rather than the character. The U+FE00-FE0F is [Variation Selectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)).\r\n\r\nAnother well-known case is ZWJ U+200D. ZWJ joins multiple code points to a character.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/^[👨‍👩‍👦]$/u.test(\"👨‍👩‍👦\") //→ false\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, this rule prevents characters which are made with multiple code points in character class syntax.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Warns about a potential error\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n/[👍]/ // ERROR: a surrogate pair in a character class without u flag.\r\n/[❇️]/u // ERROR: variation selectors in a character class.\r\n/[👨‍👩‍👦]/u // ERROR: ZWJ in a character class.\r\n/[🇯🇵]/u // ERROR: a U+1F1E6-1F1FF pair in a character class.\r\n/[👶🏻]/u // ERROR: an emoji which is made with an emoji and skin tone selector, in a character class.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nThis is not library specific matter and it's difficult to distinguish whether character class syntax handles the character as one character or not.","closed_by":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10049/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
