Thanks for writing up this proposal.\r\n\r\nA few questions/notes came to mind when reading this:\r\n\r\n* It seems like the distinction between a stylistic rule and a non-stylistic rule could be fuzzy in some cases. For example, my intuition would be to consider `prefer-const` a stylistic rule because the code will still work fine if `let` is used instead. I don't feel strongly about it and I'd be fine with calling `prefer-const` a non-stylistic rule, but I'm wondering if we would want a more precise guideline for what counts as stylistic.\r\n* You mentioned that the primary use case is in editor integrations. I'm not sure if you've seen, but in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/8039 we recently added a hook for `CLIEngine` users to provide a filter function for fixes (although that hook isn't exposed to the CLI). If we added a good way for integrations to determine whether a rule is stylistic, do you think that would fulfill the same use case (since integrations could provide a filter function that only applies fixes from stylistic rules)? Or is it important that we make this functionality first-class for ease of use?\r\n* I would favor using something other than `meta.docs.category` to distinguish between stylistic/non-stylistic rules, because `meta.docs.category` is already used by some plugins for plugin-specific categories.\r\n* You mentioned that \"rules that enforce best practices are often more useful when not autofixed so developers can see the warning and better understand what will happen to their code when autofixed.\" With some rules, such as `no-useless-escape`, we currently don't implement an autofixer because the warning might be signaling a bug in the user's code, which seems similar to the type of case you're describing here. If we added a way to only fix stylistic issues, is your expectation that we would add fixers for rules like `no-useless-escape` since the user would have the option to turn them off? More generally, I'm trying to get a better sense of the ways you envision this being used.\r\n* `eslint --fix problems foo.js` is already a valid ESLint invocation that does something else (it runs ESLint with the `--fix` flag on two files called `problems` and `foo.js`). Changing the functionality would technically be backwards-incompatible, although this case seems unlikely enough that it might not be worth addressing.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/420487362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/420495565","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10855#issuecomment-420495565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10855","id":420495565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDQ5NTU2NQ==","user":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T02:58:09Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T02:58:09Z","body":"I'm fine with adding something like that in.

thanks for the feedback, let me try to answer your questions:\r\n\r\n1. I've always considered a rule to be stylistic if implementing the fix doesn't change the meaning of the code. So `prefer-const` I would consider non-stylistic because it changes (albeit slightly) the meaning of the code.\r\n2. Thanks for pointing out #8039, I did not see that! Very cool. That could definitely be used to implement my suggestion. I'm still of the mind that a command line option is important for this, but it seems like an editor could use the existing functionality plus a categorization mechanism to implement without a command line change.\r\n3. Yeah, I wasn't too keen on using `meta.docs.category` either, just wanted to throw it out there as a potential. I'd more like `meta.type` as `\"problem\"` or `\"style\"`.\r\n4. I wouldn't change `no-useless-escape`. I'm not suggesting giving fine-grained control of autofixing, only to provide a very broad categorization in order to give some additional control to end users. To me, there are three categories of rule fixes:\r\n  1. It is completely safe to make the fix because it does not change the meaning of the code (`semi`)\r\n  2. It is somewhat safe to make the fix because it does not *meaningfully* change the meaning of the code (`prefer-const`)\r\n  3. It is not safe to make the fix because the change *significantly* changes the meaning of the code (`no-useless-escape`)\r\n  4. It is not safe to make the fix because it is not clear what the fix would be (`no-empty`)\r\n5. Nice catch! I'll label this as \"breaking.\"\r\n\r\n@ilyavolodin Yes, I'd envision whatever we use to flag rules as a particular type would be made available to plugins.\r\n\r\nBy the way, one of my biggest regrets is that we never really drew a firm line in the sand between rules that are stylistic and rules that are not, and I think the project has had some growing pains because of that. I'm hoping this can be one step in the direction of making things a bit more

giving this some thought, I'd like to revise my proposal a bit. There were a couple of things that bothered me about my proposal based on the feedback:\r\n\r\n1. It is a breaking change. I really didn't want to introduce breaking behavior.\r\n1. The `prefer-const` example that @not-an-aardvark brought up made me think that just having problems and styles wasn't actually specific enough.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to update my proposal as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Add a `meta.type` property to all rules (also available to plugins) that allows you to specify the type of rule. The type of rule would be singular, so \"problem\" not \"problems\".\r\n1. Allow three designations of rule types in order to match the three different type of fixes ESLint does:\r\n    * **problem** - something that is a possible error (`no-unexpected-multiline`)\r\n    * **suggestion** - something that isn't a possible error but you might want to change (`prefer-const`)\r\n    * **style** - something that doesn't affect what the code means\r\n1. Instead of changing how `--fix` works, I propose instead adding a new `--fix-type` flag that lets you specify the type of fixes to apply. So you would use `--fix --fix-type problem`, for example. This has the added benefit of also working with `--fix-dry-run`, which is something my original proposal did not take into account. You can specify more than one fix type using commas (`--fix-type problem,style`) or multiple flags (`--fix-type problem --fix-type style`).\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/421081850/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1844184595,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg0NDE4NDU5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1844184595","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-13T17:10:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1844184596,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NDQxODQ1OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1844184596","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-13T17:10:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1844206241,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTg0NDIwNjI0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1844206241","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-13T17:20:27Z","label":{"name":"breaking","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_gi

However, this only really applies to rule issues. Core issues need TSC discussion. So while it's useful to have core issues on this page in order to show community popularity, I wonder if they should be categorized differently.\r\n\r\nWhat I would suggest is that core issues should get their own table (i.e., filter out label:core from the current tables, then add a new table with label:core issues).
