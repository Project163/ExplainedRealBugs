@watuwo, thanks for the issue!\r\n\r\nThis works as intended. This rule reports hex and unicode escape sequences as well as raw characters that represent control characters.\r\n\r\n> As a rationale of the rule https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-control-regex says: \"These characters are rarely used in JavaScript strings so a regular expression containing these characters is most likely a mistake\".\r\n\r\nBy \"strings\" it means strings on which the regular expression will be used, not regex pattern strings. The rationale is that any of \\u0000-\\u001F is more likely a typo than an intention to match that character because most of those characters rarely appear in strings, while those that are common have shorter escape sequences like `\\t` and `\\n`.\r\n\r\nWe should clarify this in the documentation, I'll work on that.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1054237000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6154536955,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5ExItlzwAAAAFu1sf7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6154536955","actor":{"login":"watuwo","id":83006066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDA2MDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83006066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo","html_url":"https://github.com/watuwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-28T13:06:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6154536962,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc5ExItlzwAAAAFu1sgC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/6154536962","actor":{"login":"watuwo","id":83006066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDA2MDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83006066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo","html_url":"https://github.com/watuwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-28T13:06:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1054639381","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15653#issuecomment-1054639381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15653","id":1054639381,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc4-3IUV","user":{"login":"watuwo","id":83006066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDA2MDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83006066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo","html_url":"https://github.com/watuwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-28T20:34:46Z","updated_at":"2022-02-28T20:34:46Z","body":"Thanks for the feedback and the clarification. Adapting the documentation will let people enable/disable the rule with more confidence.\r\n\r\n*Personally* I would have preferred the rule to work according to my initial expectations. I feel like accidentally dropping a backslash is more likely something I would do than accidentally matching a control character.

It results in a pattern with the character's code point, but it works the same as the pattern with an escape sequence for that character.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew RegExp('\\t').test(\"\\t\"); // true\r\nnew RegExp('\\\\t').test(\"\\t\"); // true\r\nnew RegExp('\\u0009').test(\"\\t\"); // true\r\nnew RegExp('\\\\u0009').test(\"\\t\"); // true\r\nnew RegExp('\\x09').test(\"\\t\"); // true\r\nnew RegExp('\\\\x09').test(\"\\t\"); // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat doesn't look consistent in the behavior of this rule is reporting `new RegExp('\\t')`. It's due to intent to report code such as `new RegExp('<TAB>')`, but since the rule only examines the pattern (string value) and doesn't map the pattern back to the original string literal, I believe the reporting of `new RegExp('\\t')` is more an implementation side effect than an intent.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1055283446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1055828528","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15653#issuecomment-1055828528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15653","id":1055828528,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc4-7qow","user":{"login":"watuwo","id":83006066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDA2MDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83006066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo","html_url":"https://github.com/watuwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/watuwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-01T20:25:38Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T20:25:38Z","body":"I agree, these examples are not errors.
