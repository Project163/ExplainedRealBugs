(Give an overview)\r\n\r\n* Updated the regex used by `astUtils.isDecimalInteger` and `isDecimalIntegerNumericToken`. Also added tests for these helpers and some tests for rules that are using them.\r\n* Added tests for `prefer-numeric-literals` and `quote-props` rules.\r\n\r\nIn total, this is one line of code + tests and comments.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n* ~`package.json` should be updated before merging.~\r\n* The other part of the changes for numeric separators is in #13574. I think these two PRs cover all that should be updated for numeric separators in this repository, but it would be good to double-check that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13581/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3734559349,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MzQ1NTkzNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3734559349","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5e0c39935ad57a5acd65fa31c473aae4697c1421","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/5e0c39935ad57a5acd65fa31c473aae4697c1421","created_at":"2020-09-06T21:55:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-06T22:08:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-06T22:08:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13664","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13664/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13664/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13664/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13664","id":694546690,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDgwOTA5NTM5","number":13664,"title":"Fix:
