The easiest way to accomplish this is by reading this information from your `package.json`.\r\n\r\nIf plugins are released using [semantic-release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release), where the version is not updated in the repository, and is only changed in the npm registry, it may not be obvious how to achieve the synchronization of version data between the plugin's `meta.version` property and the published `package.json`'s `version` property.\r\n\r\nAlso, providing an example of how to automate this step would help towards the name and version data being consistently published across all plugins, whether or not the committed package.json contains an up-to-date `version` property.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nIn https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/blob/main/configs.js there is an example which uses:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { name, version } = require(\"./package.json\")\r\n\r\nconst plugin = {\r\n    meta: { name, version }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPossibly this could be added to the example in [Create Plugins > Meta Data in Plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#meta-data-in-plugins) and published (or the equivalent code using `import` instead of `require`).\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nI looked through the plugins which have been marked as v9 compatible on https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18391 and most of them actually store their `version` in the committed `package.json`. Examples of ones which do not are:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments\r\n- https://github.com/eslint-functional/eslint-plugin-functional\r\n- https://github.com/playwright-community/eslint-plugin-playwright\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
