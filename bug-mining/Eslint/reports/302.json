If you are proposing a new rule, please continue on. If you are here for another reason, please see below:\r\n\r\n    1. To report a bug: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/reporting-bugs\r\n    2. To request a rule change: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/rule-changes\r\n    3. To request a change that is not a bug fix, rule change, or new rule: https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/changes\r\n    4. If you have any questions, please stop by our chatroom: https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint\r\n\r\n    Note that leaving sections blank will make it difficult for us to troubleshoot and we may have to close the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Please describe what the rule should do:**\r\n\r\nDisallows duplicate test conditions in `if-else-if` chains.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Warns about a potential error (problem)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nif (a > 1) {\r\n    foo();\r\n} else if (a > 1) {\r\n    bar();\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (a === 1) {\r\n    foo();\r\n} else if (a === 2) {\r\n    bar();\r\n} else if (a === 3) { \r\n    baz();\r\n} else if (a === 2) {\r\n    quux();\r\n} else if (a === 5) {\r\n    quuux();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nIt's a possible error. A statement with a duplicate condition can never execute (unless it's an unusual use case with side effects).\r\n\r\nThis rule is similar to the existing `no-duplicate-case`. The error could be due to a copy & paste and a long chain.\r\n\r\nThe test nodes would be compared by their tokens.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nYes.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12469/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
