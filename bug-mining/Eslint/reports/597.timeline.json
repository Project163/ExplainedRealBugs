there is no information in the docs about how a plugin might migrate to support flat configs.\r\n\r\nFor example - one would need to migrate shared configs to the new format - but what does that look like? I know that the `plugins` key needs to change its form - but [the existing docs still use the old form](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#configs-in-plugins).\r\n\r\nHow should a plugin go about supporting both flat and classic configs? What's the best-practice for doing this?\r\nFor example `eslint-plugin-react` exports `configs` from the package root in the classic form, and provides imports for each config in the flat form (`require('eslint-plugin-react/configs/recommended')`). Is this the \"best practice\" way of doing it? Is there another way?\r\n\r\nWhat about things like `languageOptions` - how can you support both?\r\n\r\nIs there tooling to do this automatically so that plugins don't have to all implement the same copy pasted logic of \"extend the classic config and rename somethings\"?\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying is that the user story for flat configs is well documented and planned out - but it feels like the developer story is lacking right now which makes it hard for plugins to build support.\r\nWe have users asking for it so they don't need the compat layers - but without clear guidance and best practices we don't want to take the step lest we do it wrong and have to release a new major version to undo a change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17391/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9904717290,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc5n9E6jzwAAAAJOXf3q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/9904717290","actor":{"login":"bradzacher","id":7462525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjI1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7462525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher","html_url":"https://github.com/bradzacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-07-24T21:05:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"JoshuaKGoldberg","id":3335181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzUxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3335181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-31T02:16:39Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T02:16:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7273","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7273/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7273/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7273/events","html_url":"https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/7273","id":1812016615,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCd3hms5V5WGs","number":7273,"title":"feat:

the time to do a little bit of refactoring to attempt to share as many types as possible and better organise things.\r\nIn particular I tried to move things a little so everything didn't hang off the `Linter` namespace like before.\r\n\r\nI believe I got everything right - it was pieced together from the docs. Sadly there is no json schema like with classic configs and the validation function is quite loose - so some of it is pieced together based on past config structure.\r\nFeel free to eyeball [the docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new) and compare them to make sure I got it right.\r\n\r\nThis change should be completely backwards-compatible - please flag if you think I made any incompatible changes though.\n\n\nTODO -

I know that the `plugins` key needs to change its form - but [the existing docs still use the old form](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#configs-in-plugins).\r\n\r\nHow should a plugin go about supporting both flat and classic configs? What's the best-practice for doing this?\r\nFor example `eslint-plugin-react` exports `configs` from the package root in the classic form, and provides imports for each config in the flat form (`require('eslint-plugin-react/configs/recommended')`). Is this the \"best practice\" way of doing it? Is there another way?\r\n\r\nWhat about things like `languageOptions` - how can you support both `languageOptions` and `parserOptions`?\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding - the configs will be validated for excess props - so plugins will need to duplicate the configs if they want to do things like extend other configs or provide `parserOptions`/`languageOptions`/`parser`.\r\n\r\nIs there tooling to do this automatically so that plugins don't have to all implement the same copy pasted logic of \"extend the classic config and rename somethings\"?\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying is that the user story for flat configs is well documented and planned out - but it feels like the developer story is lacking right now which makes it hard for plugins to build support.\r\n\r\nWe on @typescript-eslint have users asking for it and they're not sure how to use our plugin with the new config file. Currently our response is \"use the compat tooling because we don't support it\".\r\nWithout clear guidance and best practices around how we are supposed to support both worlds in a fully backwards compatible way - we don't want to take the step lest we do it wrong and have to release a new major version to undo/fixup a change.\r\n\r\nI'm sure a lot of other plugins and community configs are in exactly the same boat.\r\nWhether we like it or not - legacy config files are going to live on for a long time - even when ESLint drops official support for them, so the ecosystem needs solid plans and tools to continue supporting them into the future.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1728729450/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradzacher","id":7462525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjI1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7462525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher","html_url":"https://github.com/bradzacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10429748283,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5n9E6jzwAAAAJtqVQ7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10429748283","actor":{"login":"typescript-eslint","id":46634674,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ2NjM0Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46634674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint","html_url":"https://github.com/typescript-eslint","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/typescript-eslint/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-21T03:59:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"JoshuaKGoldberg","id":3335181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzUxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3335181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshuaKGoldberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-26T14:05:31Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T14:05:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7694","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7694/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7694/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7694/events","html_url":"https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7694","id":1913595156,"node_id":"I_kwDOCd3hms5yDyUU","number":7694,"title":"ESLint

See: https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v7**\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nESLint is adding an exciting new config system called \"flat\" configs: \r\n\r\n* Configuration files docs: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new\r\n* Configuration migration guide: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide\r\n\r\n**`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` does not yet officially support ESLint flat configs.** We'd certainly like it to soon. But doing so is a nontrivial in-progress task and isn't done yet. Flat configs with TypeScript code _may_ work in your specific project. They may not. \r\n\r\nTracking references:\r\n- [x] #7273: adding type definitions to work with well-typed flat config files\r\n- [x] https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17242: upstream ESLint issue for adding the docs we need to know how to provide support\r\n- [x] #7935: adds support for flat config files to our tooling\r\n\r\nIf you're filing a complex / configuration issue on typescript-eslint, for now, please make sure you're using traditional ESLint configs. We'll post back in this issue once we can officially provide support for using `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` with flat configs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7694/reactions","total_count":48,"+1":47,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7694/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10606684448,"node_id":"AE_lADOAKjKDc5n9E6jzwAAAAJ4NSkg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10606684448","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-10T16:08:54Z","assignee":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10608570835,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc5n9E6jzwAAAAJ4UfHT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/10608570835","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"007a096053f8085437d9febb14eff97e2e9642cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/007a096053f8085437d9febb14eff97e2e9642cc","created_at":"2023-10-10T19:09:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-10T19:11:43Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T19:11:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17640","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17640/
