We can enforce this in rule schema.\r\n* \"suggested fix\" means that the rule provides a [suggestion](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#providing-suggestions) instead of autofixing the code. The examples with \"suggested fix\" are those where the replacement code might not have the same behavior as the original code. In particular, because of possible getters/setters.\r\n* Member expression can be more complex than `a.b`. We can use [`isSameReference`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/5891c7533f500110129fdea7b9b63c8a409da0bd/lib/rules/utils/ast-utils.js#L392) helper function. For example, `a.b.c = a.b.c || foo` should be reported, but `f(a).b = f(a).b || foo` should not.\r\n* When the member expression is more complex, the fix must be a suggestion instead of autofix, because of possible getters. For example, `a.b.c || (a.b.c = foo)`. See [`canBeFixed`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/5891c7533f500110129fdea7b9b63c8a409da0bd/lib/rules/operator-assignment.js#L49) in the `operator-assignment` rule.\r\n* `if` should not have `else`.\r\n* All examples with `if` also apply to single-statement blocks. For example, `if (!a) { a = foo; }` should be reported.\r\n* The left-right order in `if` conditions shouldn't matter. For example, `a === undefined || a === null` is the same as `null === a || undefined === a`.\r\n* `void 0` can be treated the same as `undefined`. For example, `if (a == void 0) a = foo;` should be reported.\r\n* Autofixes/suggestions should account for possible extra parentheses. For example, `(a) = ((a) || foo)`. It's okay to remove them, but the end result should be valid code (for example, the autofix/suggestion shouldn't remove a left parenthesis but leave the corresponding right parenthesis).\r\n* If any comments exists in the range that is going to be replaced, we can skip providing the
