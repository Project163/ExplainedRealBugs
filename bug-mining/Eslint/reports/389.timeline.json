I understand for arrow functions it may be enticing to allow it, but it would defeat the purpose of this rule, IMO.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I'd not make any exceptions (except `return;`, of course) --- I personally changed my mind even on the `return resolve()`/`return reject()`, because even though it's innocuous (and will make writing certain cases easier), it again potentially introduces complexity. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Promise(resolve => {\r\n  return resolve(someAsyncStuff())\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though `resolve` doesn't return anything (and it wouldn't matter either way) it introduces tiny bit of complexity again because you need think for a bit on the significance of the return, before realizing there's none.\r\n\r\nNot making exceptions also allows for 1) easier implem
