ESLint version\n\nv9.x\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nCurrently the only way to pass [feature flags](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/flags/) is via the CLI or NodeJS API directly.\n\nThis is cumbersome at scale because:\n- opting-in users into the flags can require large-scale coordination to get people to change their IDE config\n- turning on a flag means having to update all NodeJS API usages across a repository at the same time\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nA much simpler alternative would be allowing passing of feature flags via an environment variable.\nThis would allow setting of the flags via direnv or similar tools to transparently turn on the flags for all developers and tools working in the repo.\n\nFor example at Canva we have tools that would allow us to inject an `export ESLINT_FLAGS=\"unstable_config_lookup_from_file\"` or similar into all users `.bashrc`/etc file -- but for various reasons we could not easily get all users to change their IDE configs (there are multiple IDEs and no shared configuration, for example).\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No
