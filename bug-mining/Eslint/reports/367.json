That issue has the original instructions to reproduce the issue, although I have been able to successfully reproduce the issue myself.\r\n\r\nIf I have a file located in a dot directory (for example, `client/.storybook/config.js`), I can lint it by telling eslint to analyze the directory it lives in (`npx eslint client/.storybook`). However, if I try to lint the file directory, I am incorrectly told that the file has been ignored because of a matching ignore pattern. I have no ignore patterns defined, so this is incorrect. The file was actually ignored due to an implicit ignore rule.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the source code below: -->\r\nSource: N/A\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\n```bash\r\nnpx eslint client/.storybook/config.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\n\r\nEslint should indicate that the file was ignored by default.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened?
