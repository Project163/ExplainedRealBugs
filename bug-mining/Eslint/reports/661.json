Please migrate to an eslint.config.js file. See https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide for details.\n\nAs reported in [this discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions/18456?notification_referrer_id=NT_kwDNlpKxMTA2NzMwMDEwMzg6Mzg1NDY&notifications_query=reason%3Amention#discussioncomment-10904454), this doesn't really give enough context to figure out why ESLint is running in eslintrc mode.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nUpdate the error message to contain the following information:\n\n1. If `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=false` is explicitly set. The poster in the previously mentioned comment had this set from a previous installation and it took a while to realize it.\n2. If possible, the location of the configuration file used. I'm not sure how easy it will be to get this info, but it's worth looking into.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
