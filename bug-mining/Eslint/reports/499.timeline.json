[X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to an item)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    The following template is intentionally not a markdown checkbox list for the reasons\r\n    explained in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12848#issuecomment-580302888\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[X] New rule ([template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eslint/eslint/HEAD/templates/rule-proposal.md))\r\n\r\n**Please describe what the rule should do:**\r\n\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Warns about a potential error\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvalue === (0 || undefined || null)\r\n\r\n!value !== null\r\n\r\nsomeFunction() != null ?? false\r\n\r\nx + b ?? 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nRecommended by TSC in #13752.\r\n\r\n#### What changes did you make? (Give an overview)\r\n\r\nAdds a rule which is similar in nature to `no-constant-condition` in that it flags conditions have constant behavior at runtime, since that is highly correlated with developer error. Specifically it checks for:\r\n\r\n* `&&` and `||` logical expressions where the left hand side is either always truthy or always falsy \r\n* `??` logical expressions where the left hand side is either always nullish or always non-nullish\r\n* `==`, `===`, `!==` and `!=` binary expressions where one side is either `null`, `undefined`, `true` or `false`, and the outcome of the comparison can be determined statically.\r\n \r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nThe code ended up begin quite verbose with comments, which I personally found helpful during development, but may not be idiomatic in this code base. I'm happy to tone them down if desired.\r\n\r\nAt its heart this rule boils down to a \"best effort\". It understands many semantics of the JavaScript language, but it must draw the line somewhere, and those lines are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. I feel pretty good about the lines I ended up setting given the [TSC Summary](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13752#issuecomment-729125654), but I'm open to feedback.\r\n\r\n## Impact and Representative Examples\r\n\r\nI ran this rule on our large monorepo and it **uncovered ~450 existing errors**. Of those, about one third looked like changes which were intended to be temporary behavior changes, or hard coded feature flags:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst enableFeature = false && shouldEnableFeature();\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally I think these would merit an `/* eslint-disable-next-line */` comment to clarify the motivation, but I could also see us wanting to add an option to permit literal `true` or `false` on the left hand side of `||` or `&&`.\r\n\r\nBelow are some representative errors it uncovered, anonymized and reduced to their pure form:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nvalue === (0 || undefined || null)\r\n\r\n!value !== null\r\n\r\nsomeFunction() != null ?? false\r\n\r\nx + b ?? 0\r\n\r\nString(someNumber) ?? 'DEFAULT_VALUE'\r\n\r\ntypeof someMemberExpression !== undefined\r\n\r\nswitch (status) {\r\n  case 'A' || 'B' || 'C' || 'D':\r\n    // some code\r\n    break;\r\n  // [...]\r\n}\r\n\r\n+value ?? 0\r\n\r\n!!someArr.find(predicate) ?? false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Rule Name\r\n\r\n**Edit** @mdjermanovic [pointed out](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15296#issuecomment-979329860) that the TSC had proposed a better name, but I missed the comment.\r\n\r\n~~Is `no-constant-binary-expression` the right name for this rule given that it also applies to the left hand side of logical expressions? *I'd rather not re-litigate, but my instinct tells me that the logical expression checks should live in `no-constant-condition` and this new rule should flag any comparison binary expression whose result is provably static.*~~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15296/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5826367948,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAKjKDc5BA8Z6zwAAAAFbR1HM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/5826367948","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-30T00:11:44Z","label":{"name":"repro:needed","color":"136971"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5826367949,"node_id":"LE_lADOAKjKDc5BA8Z6zwAAAAFbR1HN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/5826367949","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-30T00:11:44Z","label":{"name":"repro:yes","color":"7A14E9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1002821850","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15467#issuecomment-1002821850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15467","id":1002821850,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc47xdja","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-30T00:16:14Z","updated_at":"2021-12-30T00:16:14Z","body":"Can you explain why you think the current behavior is incorrect for the cases you provided?

When we recurse into expressions when handling `TemplateLiteral`, we should *at least* always be passing `inBooleanPosition` as `false` since we are not  concerned with truthiness or falsyness of the sub-expression, but rather whether it might conditionally coerce to an empty or non-empty string.\r\n2. When handling an `ArrayExpression` and `inBooleanPosition` is `false`, we should require that all elements be constant no matter what the parent node is. (This would also catch the case where the only element is a `SpreadExpression`)\r\n3. When handling an `ObjectExpression` when `inBooleanPosition` is `false`, we should return `false` if the object defines `valueOf` or `toString` (or contains a spread).\r\n\r\n**I think issue underlying numbers 2 and 3 is the fact that calling `isConstant` with `inBooleanPosition` is poorly defined.**\r\n\r\nTo help remedy this, I'd like to propose a more precise definition:\r\n\r\n> For both string and number, if coerced to that type, the value will be constant.\r\n\r\nI believe if we adopt this definition, and then ensured the function conforms to it, `isConstant` can be made sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1003286770/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"captbaritone","id":162735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone","html_url":"https://github.com/captbaritone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/captbaritone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1003467648","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15467#issuecomment-1003467648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15467","id":1003467648,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc47z7OA","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-31T23:58:15Z","updated_at":"2021-12-31T23:58:15Z","body":"That sounds like a reasonable approach to me.
