think it was done for historical reasons. ESLint originally only supported js files. Once we added support for jsx we had the need to also lint jsx files, but at that point, all the rules that would apply to js files would also apply to jsx files, so there was no reason to create separate configurations for extensions. As such it was added as a command line flag. @nzakas wanted to change the functionality of how extensions are specified and also modify the way preprocessors are configured, but we never got around to doing that.\r\nThat being said, the way ESLint works is that config files are constructed after the files that are supposed to be linted are found. So if you specify extensions in the config, it's going to be too late at that point to find appropriate files.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/418742912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1827931615,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgyNzkzMTYxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1827931615","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-05T14:03:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1827931618,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4Mjc5MzE2MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1827931618","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-05T14:03:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sindresorhus","id":170270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDI3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus","html_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-10T05:06:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T05:06:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xojs/eslint-config-xo-typescript/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xojs/eslint-config-xo-typescript","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xojs/eslint-config-xo-typescript/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.

I'm not sure how many people extend the eslint plugin's recommended config (it has a bunch of stylistic rules, so it might be that people just add the parser without the plugin?)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/456095404/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SimenB","id":1404810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDQ4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1404810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB","html_url":"https://github.com/SimenB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimenB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/456099206","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10828#issuecomment-456099206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10828","id":456099206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjA5OTIwNg==","user":{"login":"g-plane","id":17216317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjE2MzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17216317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane","html_url":"https://github.com/g-plane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/g-plane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T14:50:30Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T14:51:27Z","body":"For current JavaScript eco-system, not only `.ts` and `.tsx` but also `.vue` is widely used.

As I mentioned, configs are constructed after globs are resolved (that's how we know where to look for configs to begin with). If extensions are going to be in config files, we will not know them soon enough to construct correct globs. For example, if you have a subfolder with only `.ts` files in it, and config file that specifies how those TypeScript files have to be linted, as well as that they should be included, how do we know that this config needs to be picked up?\r\nWe could possibly restructure the whole file traversal to first search for `.eslintrc.*` files, and then, based on the specified extensions search for files to be linted, but first of all - it would mean two file system traversal instead of one, second - it would significantly complicate file resolutions process, since if a subfolder contains \"extensions: '.ts'\" (for example), only that subfolder and it's child's folders should be scanned for `.ts` files.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/456103842/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilyavolodin","id":1380062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODAwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1380062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyavolodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyavolodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
