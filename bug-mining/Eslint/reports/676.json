Environment\n\nNode version: v20.18.1\nnpm version: v10.8.2\nLocal ESLint version: v9.18.0 (Currently used)\nGlobal ESLint version: Not found\nOperating System: darwin 24.2.0\n\n\n### What parser are you using?\n\n@typescript-eslint/parser\n\n### What did you do?\n\nWhen running eslint strictly using the CLI command it will report that no files are matching. But using the legacy engine through `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` works.\n\nThe use case is that we have a large repository (> 1M LoC) where we want to update rules from warn to error one at a time. And we want to use the auto fix of eslint to fix only a single rule, instead of all fixable problems.\n\nThe command I am trying to run for flat config:\n\n```bash\nnode_modules/.bin/eslint \\\n--plugin '@typescript-eslint' \\\n--parser '@typescript-eslint/parser' \\\n--parser-options '{\"project\":\"packages/awesome-helpers/tsconfig.json\"}' \\\n--rule '{\"@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-exports\": \"error\"}' \\\n--no-config-lookup \\\n--no-cache \\\n\"packages/awesome-helpers/src/**/*.ts\"\n```\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\n```\n/path/to/packages/awesome-helpers/src/index.ts\n  1:1  error  All exports in the declaration are only used as types. Use `export type`  @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-exports\n\n✖ 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)\n  1 error and 0 warnings potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.\n```\n\n### What actually happened?\n\n```\nOops! Something went wrong! :(\n\nESLint: 9.18.0\n\nYou are linting \"packages/awesome-helpers/src/**/*.ts\", but all of the files matching the glob pattern \"packages/awesome-helpers/src/**/*.ts\" are ignored.\n\nIf you don't want to lint these files, remove the pattern \"packages/awesome-helpers/src/**/*.ts\" from the list of arguments passed to ESLint.\n\nIf you do want to lint these files, explicitly list one or more of the files from this glob that you'd like to lint to see more details about why they are ignored.\n\n  * If the file is ignored because of a matching ignore pattern, check global ignores in your config file.\n    https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore\n\n  * If the file is ignored because no matching configuration was supplied, check file patterns in your config file.\n    https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#specifying-files-with-arbitrary-extensions\n\n  * If the file is ignored because it is located outside of the base path, change the location of your config file to be in a parent directory.\n```\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\n\nhttps://github.com/Pouja/eslint-auto-fix-issue\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_I really like that we have switched to flat configs, thanks for the awesome work_","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
