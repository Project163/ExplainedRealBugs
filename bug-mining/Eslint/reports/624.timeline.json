(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds suggestions to `use-isnan` when using `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf`.\r\nThe current fix changes them to `findIndex` & `findLastIndex` respectively.\r\nI wanted to suggest also `includes` and `some` as second and third suggestions, but I got into a rabbit hole of checking whether the parent node is a `BinaryExpression` and whether the developer used `indexOf() !== -1`, `indexOf() > 0`, etc.\r\nWe can probably do that, just need to find all the cases. Do you think it's worth the effort?\r\n\r\n(Probably?) Closes #17978\r\n\r\n#### NOTE\r\n\r\nLet's wait until https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/18059 is merged before merging this one, because it'll require me to extend the new tests that were added there.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004 -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11805264654,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc57qCUgzwAAAAK_pgsO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/11805264654","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"74124c20287fac1995c3f4e553f0723c066f311d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/74124c20287fac1995c3f4e553f0723c066f311d","created_at":"2024-02-14T18:01:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13681352726,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAKjKDc57qCUgzwAAAAMveOAW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/13681352726","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-29T14:13:58Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13681353029,"node_id":"LE_lADOAKjKDc57qCUgzwAAAAMveOFF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/13681353029","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-29T14:13:59Z","label":{"name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
