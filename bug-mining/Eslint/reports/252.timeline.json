not opposed if the team consensus is to add support to ESLint init specifically for Typescript. After all, we already explicitly ask about React. However, I'm worried about potentially having to field more requests to add support for Flow or other libraries/frameworks.\r\n\r\nESLint was built to get out of the business of legislating rules, and pluggability has been a core design principle in that area. But we haven't done the same with init.\r\n\r\nSo, what I would like us to at least consider is: How can we make ESLint init more pluggable? Is there a way we could let plugins extend our init somehow? If such a thing could be implemented, then I envision typescript-eslint could export a binary in their package which might be something like, `typescript-eslint-init`, and they could choose to ask all, some, or none of the core ESLint init questions and add questions related to the plugin or to the language/framework/library on which the plugin is based.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/497198099/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/498011539","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11789#issuecomment-498011539","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11789","id":498011539,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODAxMTUzOQ==","user":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-02T08:42:47Z","updated_at":"2019-06-02T08:42:47Z","body":"Personally, I think it might be difficult to have a \"pluggable `eslint --init`\" along those lines due to problems with discoverability.
