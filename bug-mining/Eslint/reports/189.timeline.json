Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [ ] Can you reproduce the problem with `Debug -> Reload Without Extensions`?\r\n* [x] Did you perform a cursory search to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\r\n* [x] Did you read the [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting)?\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to write a good bug report read [here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)\r\nFor more information on how to contribute read [here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to start working towards upgrading Node.js to v10? Node.js v6 has already reached it's end of life.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, what actually brought me here, was that the newest version of ESLint, 6.0.1 (for use with the ESLint plugin that _ships with Brackets_, thus why I decided to report it here) does not work with Brackets. However, this is **NOT** an issue with [brackets-eslint](https://github.com/brackets-userland/brackets-eslint). Starting with ESLint 6, ESLint requires Node.js v8 and above. Brackets ships with Node.js 6.14.0.\r\nRelated issues\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11944\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11456\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, ESLint@^5.16.0 should be used.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install ESLint ^6.0.0 into the project folder as per [brackets-eslint instructions](https://github.com/brackets-userland/brackets-eslint)\r\n2. Provide a .eslint configuration\r\n3. Start Brackets\r\n4. Try to use the linter\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** ESLint linter messages to appear\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The ESLint pane shows an error (because brackets-eslint thinks that ESLint isn't installed)\r\n```\r\nNodeDebugUtils.js:111 [node-error 7:08:14 PM] [brackets-eslint] Wasn't able to load eslint from C:\\Users\\Ethan\\Workspace\\mc-mod-tool\\node_modules\\eslint\\lib\\api.js, be sure to run 'npm install' properly: C:\\Users\\Ethan\\Workspace\\mc-mod-tool\\node_modules\\eslint\\lib\\cli-engine\\cli-engine.js:257\r\n        ...calculateStatsPerFile(messages)\r\n        ^^^\r\n\r\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token ...\r\n    at createScript (vm.js:56:10)\r\n    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:97:10)\r\n    at Module._compile (module.js:549:28)\r\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:586:10)\r\n    at Module.load (module.js:494:32)\r\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:453:12)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:445:3)\r\n    at Module.require (module.js:504:17)\r\n    at require (internal/module.js:20:19)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (C:\\Users\\Ethan\\Workspace\\mc-mod-tool\\node_modules\\eslint\\lib\\cli-engine\\index.js:3:23)handleLogEvent @ NodeDebugUtils.js:111\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\nBrackets: Release 1.14 build 1.14.0-17740 (release 329d08ffc)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adobe/brackets/issues/14826/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adobe/brackets/issues/14826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2671504016,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjY3MTUwNDAxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2671504016","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T22:18:21Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2671504022,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2NzE1MDQwMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2671504022","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-29T22:18:22Z","label":{"name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
