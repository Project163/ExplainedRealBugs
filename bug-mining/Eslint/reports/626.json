Reporting multiple configuration comments as lint errors is a breaking change.\r\n2. The first comment will apply, while it used to be the last comment. This could be avoided by applying the last comment and reporting previous ones, but I think it makes more sense to report those that appear later.","closed_by":{"login":"snitin315","id":46647141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjQ3MTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46647141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315","html_url":"https://github.com/snitin315","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snitin315/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18132/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
