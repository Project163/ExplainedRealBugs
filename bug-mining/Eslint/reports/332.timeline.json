(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nno-constant-condition uses a recursive function `isConstant` to detect if items are constants. \r\n\r\nPreviously we were presuming that all arrays were always constant. Since an array can hold variables, if we are inside of a binary evaluation it is possible for the array to change and there for change the conditional.   \r\n\r\nNow, if we are in a binary expression, we will calculate isConstant on each element of the array, and only return true if all elements are constant\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nPer the espree docs, array elements of sparse arrays have values of null. I have added a check at the beginning of the function to handle this, but I could see the argument to handle this situation in other ways such as a filter.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2658169932,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI2NTgxNjk5MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2658169932","actor":{"login":"tickct","id":8871975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct","html_url":"https://github.com/tickct","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tickct/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b146b51b6f5d39a56274dcac6f92295366274ca9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tickct/eslint/commits/b146b51b6f5d39a56274dcac6f92295366274ca9","created_at":"2019-09-24T13:58:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/534725102","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12225#issuecomment-534725102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12225","id":534725102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNDcyNTEwMg==","user":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-24T20:03:49Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T20:03:49Z","body":"A
