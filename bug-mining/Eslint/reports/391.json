This could be a breaking change or you could immediately accept additional properties alongside the existing ones and phase them out at the next scheduled release.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether users need to use these terms in order to use your API, but I see them in the changelog and in the code.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe Code of Conduct says to use welcome and inclusive language and there's certainly more inclusive language that could be used for this part of the api. In addition, you're in the position of setting an example with the terminology that you choose to use. This post does a good job of detailing why the terms derive from prejudice: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/terminology-its-not-black-and-white\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\nIf id-allowlist and id-denylist don't fit exactly, alternative API properties could be excluded-ids, permitted-ids\r\n\r\nPlease note, this is my first issue request on a public API\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding of the significance of this issue\r\n\r\nPrior conversation on other repositories:\r\n\r\nrails/rails#33677\r\nFullHuman/purgecss#428\r\ngetsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/2640","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13407/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":15,"-1":8,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
