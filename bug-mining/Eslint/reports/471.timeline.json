When given the value `\"never\"`, reserved words and\r\n>   keywords can also not be used as property names (as in Internet\r\n>   Explorer's old parser).\r\n\r\nConsequently, `espree` (ESLint's default parser, which uses `acorn`) allows reserved words when `ecmaVersion: 3` is specified, since we are not setting this option so the defaults apply.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what was the reasoning for these defaults in `acorn`. With `allowReserved: false`, it does throw a parsing error ([astexplorer.net snippet](https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/39b93153128ee6cf2230a86d6de45ed1/95e27c601f3b484ca961f4bfb6c834a45eccf535)). \r\n\r\nWe could consider setting `allowReserved: false` [here](https://github.com/eslint/espree/blob/63bd0bc46adfbcd3a71d4cc222aa3923b76ebcf2/lib/espree.js#L66), but that feels like a breaking change.
