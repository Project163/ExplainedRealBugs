It's nice in that it flags anytime such properties are accessed, and the `allowAfterThis` and `allowAfterSuper` rules make possible to work with these properties inside a class.\r\n\r\nI have found an additional case that would be nice to allow: when an instance method or constructor wants to invoke a \"private\" static method. To make this possible without having to disable the rule on a case-by-case basis, I'd like to add an option to allow underscore dangles when referencing properties on `this.constructor`.\r\n \r\n**What rule do you want to change?**\r\n\r\n`no-underscore-dangle`\r\n\r\n**Does this change cause the rule to produce more or fewer warnings?**\r\n\r\nFewer, optionally.\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented?
