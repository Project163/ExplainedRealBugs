So the `parserOptions.experimentalObjectRestSpread` option has finished its role.\r\n\r\nThe `parserOptions.experimentalObjectRestSpread` option has some confusion because we added it early time.\r\n\r\n- There are three node types for the same syntax; `ExperimentalRestProperty`, `RestProperty`, and `RestElement`. And spread properties are so. This is unfortunate for plugin ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `parserOptions.experimentalObjectRestSpread` option sometimes has hidden bug fixes in acorn. For example:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/353\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/341\r\n\r\nThe cause is that we make some overridden methods on espree to implement it. In fact, the implementation of `parserOptions.experimentalObjectRestSpread` has a bug about the duplication check of ES modules currently.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const b = 1\r\nexport const {a, ...b} = obj // \"SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared\" in `ecmaVersion:2018`, but not in `experimentalObjectRestSpread:true`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nRemove the `parserOptions.experimentalObjectRestSpread` option in the next major version, 5.0.0.\r\nTo replace it by `parserOptions.ecmaVersion: 2018` to migrate.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to [Migrating to 2.0.0](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/migrating-to-2.0.0#language-options) we have done in past.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n- Reducing confusion about AST node types. This removal removes `ExperimentalRestProperty` and `ExperimentalSpreadProperty`.\r\n- Reducing bugs. This removal removes the double management of the implementation of Rest/Spread Properties. This will prevent bugs such as https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/341 and https://github.com/eslint/espree/pull/353. We can get bug fixes in acorn quickly in the future.\r\n- Making consistent. We specify ECMA262 Standard version by `parserOptions.ecmaVersion` option since 2.0.0. The `parserOptions.experimentalObjectRestSpread` option is the last exception.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n- Many users are using the `parserOptions.experimentalObjectRestSpread` option. This removal can cause confusion in migrating to 5.0.0.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
