A single-line comment works well, as in [this demo](https://eslint.org/demo#eyJ0ZXh0IjoiLyogZXNsaW50LWVudiBicm93c2VyICovXG5cbndpbmRvdzsiLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7InBhcnNlck9wdGlvbnMiOnsiZWNtYVZlcnNpb24iOjEyLCJzb3VyY2VUeXBlIjoic2NyaXB0IiwiZWNtYUZlYXR1cmVzIjp7fX0sInJ1bGVzIjp7Im5vLXVuZGVmIjoyfSwiZW52Ijp7fX19).\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a test case or a discussion that would confirm that this was intentional. It looks like a common bug with `.` in a regular expression that doesn't have the `s` flag.\r\n\r\nAlso, `noInlineConfig: true` option does report multiline `eslint-env` as a directive:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  rules: {\r\n    \"no-undef\": \"error\"\r\n  },\r\n  noInlineConfig: true\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint-env browser \r\n*/\r\n\r\nwindow;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1:1  warning  '/*eslint-env*/' has no effect because you have 'noInlineConfig' setting in your config (.eslintrc.js)\r\n  4:1  error    'window' is not defined  \r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
