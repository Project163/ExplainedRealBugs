I would recommend that the reviewers check using a tool as well. The tools are: \r\n\r\n- [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/) - This was the most useful tool with the best data, but it's paid (you can use the 1 week free trial, which is what I did)\r\n- [Broken Link Checker](https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/) - free tool\r\n\r\nOnce the changes have been approved the changes to the following files **must** be reverted: \r\n\r\n- `docs/src/static/robots.njk`\r\n- `docs/src/_includes/layouts/base.html`\r\n\r\nThese changes were made to let the link checker tools parse the staging site. \r\n\r\nAlso, this PR should be reviewed, merged, and deployed together with https://github.com/eslint/eslint.org/pull/388. This PR is for the redirects associated with the IA changes. \r\n\r\n~Also, I'm not sure why but the PR says I have conflicting files (see below). Not sure why as I've rebased the changes on top of the current `main` branch. would appreciate any ideas on how to fix.~ (edit: resolved)\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004

\r\n\r\n- Added 'Working Groups' page to the TOC\r\n- kept 'Getting the Source Code' at the top of the 'Contribute to ESLint' TOC section. this page will go away as part of #16775\r\n- per

update RFC says the page /use/configure/plugins should be called \"Configure Plugins\", but made the name here \"Configure Plugins & Parsers\" b/c the page contains parser info as well. there should be separate pages for plugins and parsers b/c they're separate entities. right now keeping page name to have both \"Configure Plugins and Parsers\" b/c page contains both, but will split up pages and have separate \"Configure Plugins\" and \"Configure Parsers\" pages in PR for this issue.\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16763\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16764\r\n-
