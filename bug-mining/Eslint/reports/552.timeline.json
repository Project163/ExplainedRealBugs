(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nPreviously, the no-invalid-regexp rule skipped flag validation for regexps with non-literal pattern.\r\nThis PR fixes the rule so that flags are validated no matter what the pattern is.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004 -->\r\nThe schema could be updated, adding a separate messageId for invalid flags, but I didn't do so - to stay focused and not to break existing tests.\r\n\r\nI needed to reorganize the code somewhat, but I tried to keep the overall feel of the coding style established in the rule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7896878970,"node_id":"CE_lADOAKjKDc5XG5w9zwAAAAHWsM96","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7896878970","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-27T00:38:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7896879047,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc5XG5w9zwAAAAHWsM_H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7896879047","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a91332b8bd9adfa2aa8110071bdf73f56d400050","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/a91332b8bd9adfa2aa8110071bdf73f56d400050","created_at":"2022-11-27T00:39:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15188880245,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAKjKDc5XG5w9zwAAAAOJU-t1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/15188880245","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-03T20:30:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15236458685,"node_id":"ATPVTE_lADOAKjKDc5XG5w9zwAAAAOMKei9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/15236458685","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url"
