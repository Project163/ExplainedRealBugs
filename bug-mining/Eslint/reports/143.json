The default for `no-unused-vars` should not warn on parameters before the first used parameter.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the source code below: -->\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport foo from 'foo';\r\n\r\nexport const AccessibilityDecorator = foo((config, Wrapped) => {\r\n\treturn class t extends React.Component {\r\n\t\trender () {\r\n\t\t\treturn <Wrapped />;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t};\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\n```bash\r\neslint .\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\n\r\nNo warnings.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened?
