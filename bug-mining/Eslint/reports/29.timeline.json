I'm not actually writing new `var someGlobalName` declarations, it's just the case that when running eslint with fix on existing files in the code base it might break files that contain those declarations so added comments doesn't work as I don't know what the contents of all files might be. @not-an-aardvark's solution is exactly what I want anyway so if that happens that would be ideal.\r\n\r\nThe option I was suggesting was more a workaround so that you could tell eslint to ignore top level vars:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint \"no-var\": [2, { ignoreGlobal: true }], \"prefer-const\": [2] */\r\nvar someGlobalVar = ...\r\n\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n    var localVariable = 10\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Would become:\r\nvar someGlobalVar = ... // Not changed as it breaks\r\n\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n    const localVariable = 10 // Changed as it's safe\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow one thing that might be a bit annoying about removing the autofix for global vars is that people might be using it with CommonJS instead of the browser in which case it *is* safe to autofix global `var` declarations, so perhaps it'd be better for some option like `environment` which could be set  to hint that autofixing global `var` declarations is safe.\r\n\r\nE.g. maybe something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint \"no-var\": [2, { env: 'commonjs' }] */\r\n\r\nvar x = 10; // Will get fixed because it's safe to fix within commonjs\r\n\r\n// ---------\r\n\r\n/* eslint \"no-var\": [2, { env: 'browser' }] */\r\n\r\nvar x = 10; // Won't get fixed because it's not safe to fix in the browser context\r\n           // but it would be nice if it were still reported \r\n           // to be fixed

I noticed when fixing up some code manually (thanks to those who fixed [this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9520) which allowed me to start using it and discover this other one) is that there's no warning for top-level `const`/`let`/`class` in the top level using the rule `no-implicit-globals`.\r\n\r\nBasically those declarations *do* introduce a global, it's just not attached window/global/self:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!doctype html>\r\n<script>\r\n    var one = 1;\r\n    let two = 2;\r\n    const three = 3;\r\n    function four() {}\r\n    class Five {}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    // Different script but the globals are still shared\r\n    console.log(one); // 1\r\n    console.log(two); // 2\r\n    console.log(three); // 3\r\n    console.log(four); // function four() {}\r\n    console.log(Five); // class Five() {}\r\n\r\n    console.log(window.one); // 1\r\n    console.log(window.two); // undefined, let/const/class aren't added to\r\n                            // the global object but are still global\r\n    var one = 12;\r\n    console.log(one); // 12\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    // But const/let for declared variables are SyntaxErrors that prevent\r\n    // the whole script running\r\n    \r\n    console.log(\"This doesn't get printed at all!\");\r\n    const two = 12; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'two' has

`sourceType: 'module'` were
