Based on the name, my initial expectation was that the lint is about the choice between `function` and arrow functions. That is kinda close but not quite right, and the docs do not anticipate this misconception.\r\n1) The docs use the term \"function expression\" to mean \"function expression assigned to a variable\". This is incorrect and further contributes to the misconception above.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nDo not use the term \"function expression\" to mean \"function expression assigned to a variable\". That is incorrect and confusing. In `const x = () => {}`, only the `() => {}` part is a function expression. As a reference, see the [Functions MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions).\r\n\r\nFor instance, I would change the summary line to\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- Enforce the consistent use of either function declarations or expressions\r\n+ Enforce the consistent use of either function declarations or expressions assigned to variables\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe explicitly state that the lint does not apply to callback functions.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nI admit the phrase \"function expression assigned to a variable\" is verbose. But brevity at the cost of technical correctness is not a good trade. It confused me and I doubt I'm the only one.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
