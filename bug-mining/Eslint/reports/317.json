Please include the actual source code causing the issue, as well as the command that you used to run ESLint.**\r\n\r\nWe run ESLint in Jenkins CI on a Windows host, and get the following type of output from failures\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9087218/67778911-cffdde80-fa5b-11e9-8baa-e5e2e633040e.png)\r\n\r\nCurrently, this means we do not know the filepath for the files with errors, only for the ones which passed.\r\n\r\nThis issue arises as a result of PR #11683. See below:\r\n<!-- Paste the source code below: -->\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/287ca562811d037bde09a47af7f5b9c7b741e022/lib/cli-engine/formatters/junit.js#L28-L36\r\n\r\nThe above code assumes that POSIX filePaths are used, meaning that the function does not work as expected in Windows.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\n```bash\r\nnpx eslint home_page.js --format junit\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\nI expect that in the `classname` tag below I can see the full path to the file, without the file extension for visualization within Jenkins CI on a Windows host. i.e. `C:\\path\\to\\file` \r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<testsuites>\r\n<testsuite package=\"org.eslint\" time=\"0\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"1\" name=\"C:\\git\\projectdirectory\\home_page.js\">\r\n<testcase time=\"0\" name=\"org.eslint.prefer-const\" classname=\"C:\\git\\projectdirectory\\home_page\"><failure message=\"&apos;msg&apos; is never reassigned.

(prefer-const)]]></failure></testcase>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n</testsuites>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\nThe function above parses `filePath` incorrectly on Windows. `path.posix.dirname('C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\file.js')` resolves to `.` on Windows, as `posix` forces an assumption of POSIX style paths.\r\n\r\nThis results in the following XML, without the full path to the file in the `classname` attribute:\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<testsuites>\r\n<testsuite package=\"org.eslint\" time=\"0\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"1\" name=\"C:\\git\\projectdirectory\\home_page.js\">\r\n<testcase time=\"0\" name=\"org.eslint.prefer-const\" classname=\"home_page\"><failure message=\"&apos;msg&apos; is never reassigned.

(prefer-const)]]></failure></testcase>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n</testsuites>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nI would propose a fix where we do not use the `posix` specific implementation of Node's `path` library, and we let Node decide which implementation to use based on the underlying OS.\r\n\r\nThe main question arises in testing. In https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/tests/lib/cli-engine/formatters/junit.js is it possible to run a test with both POSIX and Windows style paths? My suggestion would be to have the test cases adapt to the current OS, but opinions would be valued here.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
