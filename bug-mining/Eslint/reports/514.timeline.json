Versions\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n@types/jasmine@4.0.3\r\njasmine-core@4.1.1\r\njasmine@4.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Issue\r\n\r\nJasmine 4 moving to dynamic import seems to break tests that run within a path that has an encoded slash.\r\n\r\nPer https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html#using-es-modules:\r\n\r\n> Jasmine loads your code using dynamic import, which should be compatible with both [ES modules](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/esm.html) and [CommonJS modules](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/modules.html).\r\n> ...\r\n> But if necessary you can configure Jasmine to load scripts using require by adding \"jsLoader\": \"require\" to your Jasmine config file. If you have code that works with \"jsLoader\": \"require\" but not without it, please [let us know](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/issues/new).\r\n\r\nIf I have a spec in the following path, it works fine:\r\n\r\n`my-project/src/my-test.spec.js`\r\n\r\nIf the path has an encoded slash, though, **it fails with the following error**:\r\n\r\n`my%2Fproject/src/my-test.spec.js`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nTypeError [ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER]: Invalid module \"/my%2Fproject/src/my-test.spec.js\" must not include encoded \"/\" or \"\\\" characters imported from /my%2Fproject/node_modules/jasmine/lib/loader.js\r\n    at new NodeError (internal/errors.js:322:7)\r\n    at finalizeResolution (internal/modules/esm/resolve.js:283:11)\r\n    at moduleResolve (internal/modules/esm/resolve.js:731:10)\r\n    at Loader.defaultResolve [as _resolve] (internal/modules/esm/resolve.js:842:11)\r\n    at Loader.resolve (internal/modules/esm/loader.js:89:40)\r\n    at Loader.getModuleJob (internal/modules/esm/loader.js:242:28)\r\n    at Loader.import (internal/modules/esm/loader.js:177:28)\r\n    at importModuleDynamically (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1028:27)\r\n    at exports.importModuleDynamicallyCallback (internal/process/esm_loader.js:30:14)\r\n    at Loader.importShim [as import_] (/my%2Fproject/node_modules/jasmine/lib/loader.js:56:3) {\r\n  code: 'ERR_INVALID_MODULE_SPECIFIER'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis same error will happen if the spec is the only thing in an encoded path, like:\r\n\r\n`/my-project/src/some%2Ftests/my-test.spec.js`\r\n\r\n# Workaround\r\n\r\nPer the documentation referenced above, adding `\"jsLoader\": \"require\"` to the Jasmine config (e.g., `jasmine.json`) allows tests to work again, I assume because it falls back to how Jasmine 3 worked.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasmine/jasmine-npm/issues/196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jasmine/jasmine-npm/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7626253661,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAKjKDc5HTrJezwAAAAHGj2Vd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7626253661","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T00:57:47Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7626253754,"node_id":"LE_lADOAKjKDc5HTrJezwAAAAHGj2W6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7626253754","actor":{"login":"eslint-github-bot[bot]","id":78982666,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Nzg5ODI2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/100364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T00:57:48Z","label":{"name":"archived
