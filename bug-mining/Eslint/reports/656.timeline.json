from me on this. Having separate types in `@types/*` packages is a common source of confusion &/| inconvenience on the TypeScript/types side. The standard DefinitelyTyped recommendation is to bundle types in packages when the package is _\"written in TypeScript\"[^1]_ - but I think that that phrasing should probably be updated to _\"has its own type definitions\"_.\r\n\r\nOnce ESLint has its own types, `@types/eslint` can become a \"stub\" package.

From what I can tell, TypeScript seems to prefer bundled types over types provided by external packages. This means that as soon as ESLint will include its own types, the types in `@types/eslint` will be ignored by the tsc compiler. I'm not sure if there will be a way to revert to using `@types/eslint` for projects that need those types for compatibility, but even so, that will require changing the TS config.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2326765653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2326838366","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18845#issuecomment-2326838366","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18845","id":2326838366,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6KsLxe","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-03T15:36:37Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T15:36:37Z","body":"Thanks for the insights @JoshuaKGoldberg, those are very helpful.\r\n\r\nAnd agree, we should definitely test with some downstream packages.

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nAdded the type definitions from `@types/eslint` to the project:\r\n\r\n- Added all type definitions in `lib/types`\r\n- Added tests in `tests/lib/types`\r\n- Added new `test:types` script to run type checking tests\r\n- Added `npm run test:types` to CI to be run on each PR\r\n- Added `types` entries to `package.json`\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, I did not enable type checking for the whole repo, just for the type tests.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be a base for us to build off of. We can look to make improvements in future PRs.\r\n\r\nfixes #18845\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nThe types are copied over as-is without modification (aside from including the license). We don't need to review their contents right now.\r\n\r\nDoes the testing setup make sense?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004

`.d.ts` TypeScript types, there are two packages consumers can pull ESLint from:\n\n* [`eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) itself: which is now the correct place\n* [`@types/eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/eslint), as published by https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/eslint: which is now slightly outdated\n\nOnce a package publishes its own types, it's common practice for the DefinitelyTyped side to mark the the old `@types/` package as a \"stub\" (no-longer-necessary) package. From https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped?tab=readme-ov-file#removing-a-package:\n\n\n> When a package [bundles](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html) its own types, types should be removed from Definitely Typed to avoid confusion.\n> \n> You can remove it by running `pnpm run not-needed <typingsPackageName> <asOfVersion> [<libraryName>]`.\n> \n> - `<typingsPackageName>`: This is the name of the directory to delete.\n> - `<asOfVersion>`: A stub will be published to `@types/<typingsPackageName>` with this version. Should be higher than any currently published version and should be a version of `<libraryName>` on npm.\n> - `<libraryName>`: Name of npm package that replaces the Definitely Typed types. Usually this is identical to `<typingsPackageName>`, in which case you can omit it.\n\nhttps://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/70012 is a good example of another package that was migrated to TypeScript. [`@types/react-datepicker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-datepicker) now has no `.d.ts` files in it.

ESLint version\n\n9.26.0\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nESLint now has first-class types (#18845) which is awesome, but there is still room for improvement, especially regarding autocomplete/intellisense. This is due to the default type for `Config.rules` just being:\n\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/f60f2764971a33e252be13e560dccf21f554dbf1/lib/types/index.d.ts#L1384-L1386\n\nThis is functional, and does provide type-safety and autocomplete around the rule severity, but it does not provide safety/autocomplete around the rules used or their options.\n\nMy main complaint is that the `rules` object and rule options have no autocomplete out-of-the-box. This makes it slightly more annoying to try to write rules quickly as I have to reference external documentation rather than bringing up autocomplete and reading through the results.\n\nRelatedly, built-in rules' options have no type safety. This means that typos in rule configs are not caught by TS, even though they totally could be. For example, currently this snippet will pass type checks:\n\n```ts\nexport default defineConfig({\n  rules: {\n    // Typo! \"nax\" instead of \"max\"\n    complexity: [\"error\", { nax: 2 }],\n    // Typo! Used a string instead of a number\n    \"max-params\": [\"error\", { max: '2' }]\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nI would like the default definition of `RulesRecord` that ESLint ships with to contain type definitions for all the first-party rules and their options out-of-the-box. I'm no ESLint expert, but as far as I can tell all the information needed to generate these types already exists in machine-readable formats, so unless I'm missing something it should be as \"simple\" as adding a script / build step that auto-generates the rules definitions.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nThis would also allow for clearer signaling of deprecated options (e.g. the `maximum` form of `max-params`) by adding the `@deprecated` tag to the documentation for that option.\n\nFinally, it would be extra useful if these type definitions would also contain the documentation for the rule / option in question so we can easily read up on what a particular rule or option does without needing to go to the full website documentation. This is a stretch goal however, and would likely require a not-insignificant amount of extra work, so I understand if it is put off / axed. If injecting the full text of the rule's / option's documentation is too much I would settle for a link directly to the documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19721/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
