OK, I have found what it happens. Thank you for providing the information.\r\n\r\nThis happens under the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. You have ESLint config in your HOME directory, but the config doesn't work because of lacking dependencies in your HOME directory. (this behavior has been same since 6.0.0)\r\n1. You have ESLint config in your project directory as well and it works well.\r\n1. You started linting with the project directory itself (i.e., `eslint .`).\r\n\r\nIn the situation, first, ESLint has checked if the directory is ignored or not. Previously this process loads only `.eslintignore`. But since 6.7.0, this process additionally loads config files from the directory that the project directory exists because it uses `ignorePatterns` property of config files. If config files were not found in the directory that the project directory exists, it loads the config file in the HOME directory.\r\n\r\nI think it's not intuitive if `eslint .` command loads config files from outside of the project

is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Bug fix: #12604 \r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #12604 as unignoring the entry directory.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `eslint dir` command had checked if the directly given directory (`dir`) is ignored by `.eslintignore` or not. By #12274, the ignore check has gotten to load config files from the directory that the `dir` exists in order to check `ignorePatterns` property. As a result, the `eslint .` command has gotten to try loading config files from `../`. Then if config files were not found from `../` and ancestors, ESLint loads personal config file.\r\n\r\nI think that it's not intuitive if the `eslint .` command checks the ignore of `.`, so this PR changes that behavior. If `eslint dir` is present and `dir` is a directory, ESLint doesn't ignore `dir` itself.\r\n\r\nActually, this change has pretty small impacts. When `dir` is an ignored path, it still ignores `dir/**` even if ESLint doesn't ignore `dir` itself. Therefore, the only impact is error messages (\"All files matched by 'dir' are ignored\" instead of \"No files matching 'dir' were found\") in most cases.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n- Is this direction right?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12607/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12607/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2834296931,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4MzQyOTY5MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2834296931","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-27T04:56:04Z","label":{"name":"patch
