Omit the fixable property if the rule is not fixable.\r\n\r\nBased on this, I would expect a rule without any `meta` at all to also not be fixable.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\nA rule without `meta` is successfully fixed when it has a fixer.\r\n\r\nThe docs are true, however, if there is a `meta` object of some sort (including an empty object); in such a case, an error will be reported that `fixable` is necessary if the rule attempts to add a fixer. But if there is no `meta` object at all, `fixable` is not necessary for fixes to be applied for the rule.\r\n\r\nI am not expecting breaking changes to start preventing fixers without `meta`; I'd just expect the docs to mention that rules still without the recommended `meta` property at all are currently still fixable.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
