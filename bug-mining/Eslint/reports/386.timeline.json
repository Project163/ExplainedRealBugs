correct, I think there should be options to turn off `for-in` and `for-of` checks for this reason.\r\n\r\nAn alternative for an user is to extract that code to a function (`hasEnumerableProperties` or `getFirstEnumerableName`) and eslint-disable just that one line, or instead use `Object.keys` over prototype chain in the function. Similar for `for-of`, an alternative could be to access the iterator directly, or do `[first] = foo` if `undefined` isn't an expected value. But, all of this would be probably inconvenient for an existing codebase.\r\n\r\nI'd still vote that the rule checks `for-in` and `for-of` as it could catch some real errors, but behind an option (or
