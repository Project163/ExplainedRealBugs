to this change, an unhandled exception in a promise that was not returned from the `test` callback would not cause test failure.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following (using default out of the box settings) results in test failures:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntest('native promises cause an unhandled rejection', function(assert) {\r\n  // imagine this was \"deep\" inside various method calls\r\n  setTimeout(function() {\r\n    throw new Error('whoops!');\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // other things that we are trying to test\r\n  assert.deepEqual(someMethod(), ['one', 'two']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this (prior to this PR) would result in a passing test suite:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntest('native promises cause an unhandled rejection', function(assert) {\r\n  // imagine this was \"deep\" inside various method calls\r\n  Promise.resolve().then(function() {\r\n    throw new Error('whoops!');\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // other things that we are trying to test\r\n  assert.deepEqual(someMethod(), ['one', 'two']);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason that what we are doing already isn't good enough is:\r\n\r\n* HTML Reporter: the default `unhandledRejection` handler does not dispatch to `window.onerror` at all... 😩 \r\n* Node CLI: unhandled rejections in Node 6.6 and higher emit a console warning, but nothing

Please include the actual source code causing the issue, as well as the command that you used to run ESLint.**\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the source code below: -->\r\n```js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\nbar() {\r\n  if (true) {\r\n    console.log('foo');\r\n  } else if (false) {\r\n    // This is a comment starting at the line beginning.\r\n    console.log('bar');\r\n  } else {\r\n    // Do something\r\n  }\r\n  return 'hello world';\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\n\r\nThe expected output is:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  bar() {\r\n    if (true) {\r\n      console.log('foo');\r\n    } else if (false) {\r\n      // This is a comment starting at the line beginning.\r\n      console.log('bar');\r\n    } else {\r\n      // Do something\r\n    }\r\n    return 'hello world';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut instead it results in:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  bar() {\r\n    if (true) {\r\n      console.log('foo');\r\n    } else if (false) {\r\n    // This is a comment starting at the line beginning.\r\n      console.log('bar');\r\n    } else {\r\n    // Do something\r\n    }\r\n    return 'hello world';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if the code lines above and below a comment get indented the same, it should also indent the comments appropriately. That they are ignored this way results in weird indentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10318/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/406817272","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9733#issuecomment-406817272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9733","id":406817272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNjgxNzI3Mg==","user":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-21T19:06:18Z","updated_at":"2018-07-21T19:06:18Z","body":"Working

(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nEnsure that comments (which are the first or sole content of a line) can only line up with preceding or following tokens if those tokens are on the immediately previous line. Otherwise, comments must be in \"correct\" location.\r\n\r\nFixing this exposed an issue in `addElementListIndent` where, when second and later elements in an element list need to be aligned with the first element and the first element begins on the same line as the containing node, comment tokens between the elements also must have offsets explicitly specified as being relative to the first element's first token. (An example of where this issue would have manifested can be found [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/tests/lib/rules/key-spacing.js#L508): The test cases in this file are all aligned with the list container, but the comment's desired offset was still 4 spaces to the right from there. This wasn't an issue before I wrote this PR, because the comment indent fallback logic was allowing it to anchor to the tokens 2 lines above or below.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the issue was accepted as a bug, I know this could increase warnings, so I've committed this as an \"Update\".\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n* Are there any more test cases I should add? (Especially for the addElementListIndent change.)\r\n* Could I replace the `hasBlankLinesBetween` function with other helper functions (e.g., `countTrailingLinebreaks`) to improve maintainabillity?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10640/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1756438327,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc1NjQzODMyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1756438327","actor":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9e76be70704c75d4e3f2a56a7528325d65e218e4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/9e76be70704c75d4e3f2a56a7528325d65e218e4","created_at":"2018-07-27T03:47:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2095346681,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjA5NTM0NjY4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2095346681","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-24T18:53:24Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2095346724,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIwOTUzNDY3MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2095346724","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-24T18:53:25Z","label":{"name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
