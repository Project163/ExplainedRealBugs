If we decide to start supporting stage features, we would need to implement everything independently in espree, and I doubt the team has time to do that. (In theory, we could accept changes to rules to support stage 3 features without supporting them in the default parser.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* > The risk of syntax changes, specifically, in stage 3 is remarkably low\r\n\r\n    From what I've seen, this doesn't seem to be the case:\r\n\r\n    * The syntax for object rest/spread has been modified several times since reaching stage 3, in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread/commit/f152f9cea8c4fcaa7c868a5fcfa63df30bdd26e0 and https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread/commit/72deb7d27aea7615455519ce0c97e0b52d636f4b.\r\n    * Separately from the proposal's status in TC39, the AST specification for object rest/spread has also changed since it reached stage 3 (see https://github.com/estree/estree/commit/996deb6bc5c2a97b3b7c27941d216d29e9d06386). In combination with the \"Experimental\" prefix in `espree`, this means that there are now 3 different AST node types for the same thing being emitted by different versions of various parsers (`ExperimenalRestProperty`, `RestProperty`, and `RestElement`). This makes for error-prone ESLint rules if they forget to account for all the cases.\r\n    * Rules generally are based on assumptions about the semantics of a feature, in addition to the syntax. As a result, semantic changes could theoretically invalidate some assumptions that a rule makes, and this would either require a rule deprecation or a breaking change in ESLint to fix. (The latter is a problem because ESLint doesn't do major releases very often, so a behavior might be broken for most of the lifetime of a proposal.)\r\n\r\n    The general problem here is that if a proposal changes, we will still have people using old versions of `babel`/`babel-eslint`/`espree`, and so we will end up needing to support multiple behaviors simultaneously at least until the next major ESLint release. This makes  I think it would be better to externalize feature support into dedicated plugins, which could make breaking changes more easily and quickly without inconveniencing the rest of ESLint's users.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/358844209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/358844649","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9804#issuecomment-358844649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9804","id":358844649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODg0NDY0OQ==","user":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-19T02:06:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T02:06:32Z","body":"eslint

Probably we can use those for parsing.\r\n\r\nIf `eslint-scope` needs updates, I can work on it.\r\n\r\nMy thought seems similar to @ljharb.\r\n\r\n- We can support stage 3 features *which are enabled by default in a browser (stable) at least*. (Rest/Spread Properties in V8 was fixed before it's available in Chrome stable.)\r\n  - Use `ecmaFeatures.experimental***: true`.\r\n  - If `ecmaVersion` is not enough to support an enabled experimental syntax, throw an error. For example, if `experimentalPrivateClassMethod` is true and `ecmaVersion` is 5 then throw.\r\n  - We don't need `Experimental` prefix in AST node type because of consistent -- not all syntactic feature introduces new node type (E.g. Optional Catch Binding).\r\n- If a breaking change happens in experimental syntax (either TC39 or ESTree), ~~we delay following it until the next major release if increasing errors. Our policy doesn't have two or more major version within a half year. We must describe the change in the release note of the major release.~~ **EDIT:** we can follow it in the next minor version. We add note \"The AST of experimental syntax can be changed in minor version\" into our semver policy.\r\n- If a breaking change happens in stable syntax, the behavior is according to `ecmaVersion`, as same as current.\r\n- **EDIT:** We accept PRs to avoid crashing by type annotations of Flow and TypeScript. ESTree has `typeAnnotation`/`returnType` field in their extensions: https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/extensions/type-annotations.md\r\n- **EDIT:** We don't accept PRs for stage 0-2 features and stage 3 features which aren't enabled by default in any browser. We recommend `babel-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-babel` for the purpose.\r\n- **EDIT:** We don't accept PRs for non-javascript syntactic features except type annotations.\r\n- Maybe we should have own AST spec to reduce breakage risk, but maybe we shouldn't have own AST spec in order to use acorn's official plugins. :thinking:

one has yet mentioned why we (maybe me, initially) decided to limit our support to stage 4 features. Here is some of the rationale, for historical purposes:\r\n\r\n1. In the beginning, we only had `ecmaFeatures`, no `ecmaVersion`. I thought this would solve the problem of having ongoing development to ECMAScript that could easily be reflected in ESLint. As it turned out, it ended up being a big pain point for ESLint users because the list of `ecmaFeatures` was so long. People found that they kept missing important features. Most just wanted to turn on everything up to a specific version. So, we got rid of almost all `ecmaFeatures` and switched to `ecmaVersion` to make life easier for everyone.\r\n2. We added support for a couple of experimental features that were not stage 4 specifically to help people who were using React. `experimentalRestSpread` and `jsx`, specifically, were added because these were the only things preventing people from using ESLint's native parser instead of `babel-eslint`. At the time, `babel-eslint` was quite a bit slower than our native parser, so we the goal here was to allow React users to use ESLint without `babel-eslint` in order to improve their performance. We had no other place to stick them besides `ecmaFeatures`.\r\n3. We added `globalReturn` to deal with the NodeJS/CommonJS problem of the extra top-level scope. Without this, the scope calculations we did were inaccurate. (#1158)\r\n4. We decided not to add any more features to `ecmaFeatures` to avoid the problem mentioned in point 1.\r\n5. We decided against adding experimental (including stage 3) features because we didn't want to get caught in a race to implement every new experimental feature like Babel does. There's just not enough time or devs available to be constantly updating everything. It's much easier for us to wait until things have finalized, at which point the features might have already ended up in Acorn, and if they haven't, we can submit them ourselves with a final implementation. This helps mitigate some of the work we have to do as a team.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental reason that we now don't support stage 3 features is because we don't know if they will end up in the next edition of ECMAScript or not. Since we are limited to the `ecmaVersion` property for setting this (as we don't want to keep adding new `ecmaFeatures`), we need to be certain that a given feature will be definitively represented in a given edition of ECMAScript before adding it. We want everyone `ecmaVersion` setting to be 100% accurate 100% of the time and, ideally, never change what it means. To put that in concrete terms: if you set `ecmaVersion: 2018` in your config, that should always mean the same thing. We don't want to change what `ecmaVersion: 2018` means because that could break someone's build.\r\n\r\nThere have been requests in the past to create something like a \"latest\" setting for `ecmaVersion` that would allow us to include everything that has been finalized up to the last publishing of Espree, but the details always got too difficult and we ended up deciding against it (#7528).\r\n\r\nSo the two real barriers to implementing stage 3 features right now are:\r\n\r\n1. We don't have a config setting to house them under. Because we don't want to add new `ecmaFeatures` and we can't definitively say which `ecmaVersion` they will end up under, we just don't have anywhere to put them.\r\n2. We want `ecmaVersion` values to always mean the same thing without introducing breaking changes, we can't really start implementing ECMAScript versions piece-by-piece.\r\n\r\nOur users rely on `ecmaVersion` pretty heavily, so unlike browsers that can just implement new features as they come along without much hassle, we don't have that ability,\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/359255034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/359270228","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9804#issuecomment-359270228","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9804","id":359270228,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTI3MDIyOA==","user":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-21T18:42:54Z","updated_at":"2018-01-21T18:42:54Z","body":"One difference is that now there's schema validation, and, the stage process means that in a given calendar year (between publications of an edition of the specification) there's a lot less churn then there used to be in stage 3 proposals.\r\n\r\nSome potential options:\r\n - ecmaVersions that do not yet exist should be schema errors, if they're not already\r\n - if, say, eslint had some sort of flag to enable the \"dotAll\" flag for regular expressions (which is now stage 4 and will be in ES2018), when the 2018 ecmaVersion was added in a semver-minor, the dotAll flag could be made to be invalid when paired with an ecmaVersion >= 2018\r\n - the dotAll flag reached stage 3 in [March 2017](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/commit/e0bef6932441300cd54b8c0aed6d591e8a18a752#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8), when 2016 was the latest ecmaVersion, but if eslint waited to add dotAll until it shipped in a browser (July 2017), then the dotAll flag could have been made invalid with any ecmaVersion < 2017 - which would mean that 2017 is the only ecmaVersion the flag is available for.

Thank you for the description. I thought that we can relax this policy because of few reasons:\r\n\r\n- Acorn now has official stage-3 syntax plugins, so the implementation cost is minimum if we can use those.\r\n- I don't think we must add the support of stage 3 syntactic features (which are enabled by default in a browser at least) by ourselves immediately, but I think we can accept PRs from the community.\r\n- I think that adding `ecmaFeatures.experimental***` is not annoying for users. Those are independent from `ecmaVersion` and most users just don't use those. However, \r\n    - we can get more time to update core rules in order to work with new syntactic features. I think we need more time to update core rules than add parsing.\r\n    - supporting stage 3 syntactic features (which are enabled by default in a browser at least) will be useful for the developers on the browser (browser extensions, Electron, and Node.js).\r\n- When an `ecmaFeatures.experimental***` gets stage 4 (...or when the official publication of the spec), we can move it to `ecmaVersion`

safe.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/359334063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1434499093,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQzNDQ5OTA5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1434499093","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-22T06:13:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1434499095,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MzQ0OTkwOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1434499095","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-22T06:13:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/359462325","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9804#issuecomment-359462325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9804","id":359462325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTQ2MjMyNQ==","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-22T15:41:08Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T15:41:08Z","body":"I thought the purpose of this issue was just to **document** what we do and don't support, not to propose changing it?\r\n\r\n@mysticatea \r\n\r\n> I think that adding ecmaFeatures.experimental*** is

One of our guiding principles has been, for a while, that we don't want people to have to update their configs all that frequently. If we add an `experimental***` flag and then later remove it, then we are forcing people to update their configs in order to get the same behavior (and if we just leave the flag, then we end up with confusing configs). I'm not a fan of that, nor the overhead of constantly adding/removing `ecmaFeatures` options (this also goes for @ljharb's proposal for `ecmaProposals`). \r\n\r\nAgain, we did all of this for ES6 features, it turned into a lot of confusion for everyone. I'd really rather not go through that again.\r\n\r\nAs long as babel-eslint exists, I'm just not convinced that there's any pressing need to jump to implement stage 3 proposals. People who really need or want to use the latest stuff are already using Babel, so having them use babel-eslint isn't a huge leap.\r\n\r\nBut again, I was under the impression that this issue was just to document the current approach to supporting ECMAScript versions and features. It seems like we should be focusing on that and if someone wants to propose a change, that should be a separate issue that lays out the use cases and requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/359462325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1435387802,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQzNTM4NzgwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1435387802","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-22T15:41:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1435387805,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MzUzODc4MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1435387805","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-22T15:41:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1435387810,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQzNTM4NzgxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1435387810","actor":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-22T15:41:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1435387811,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MzUzODc4MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/14
