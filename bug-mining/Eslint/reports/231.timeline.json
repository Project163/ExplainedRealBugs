In the specific `let` token does not have `Keyword` type anymore but instead has type `Identifier` (this is probably because of [this](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-let-and-const-declarations-static-semantics-early-errors) so this problem is also loosely correlated to #11830)\r\n\r\nThis change affect the `newline-after-var` rule as it use the following check to group together chunks of variable declaration ([link to actual code](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rules/newline-after-var.js#L199)):\r\n```js\r\nif (nextToken.type === \"Keyword\" && isVar(nextToken.value)) {\r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the second part of the if is still valid the first now fails for `let` variables (this bug does not affects `const` or `var`)\r\n\r\n**Related babel-eslint issue**\r\nhttps://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/771\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\r\nyes if we can agree on a solution and where to implement it (`eslint`@`newline-after-var` rule or `babel-eslint`@`babylon-to-espree` code)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2420327589,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQyMDMyNzU4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2420327589","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-18T10:20:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2420327878,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI0MjAzMjc4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2420327878","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1b5661ae467c227c0239e06cc1466480004aa799","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/1b5661ae467c227c0239e06cc1466480004aa799","created_at":"2019-06-18T10:20:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2437526666,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI0Mzc1MjY2NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2437526666","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"72b1a1c774a6721b09b7654cf6942886e1bed80b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/third-culture-software/bhima/commits/72b1a1c774a6721b09b7654cf6942886e1bed80b","created_at":"2019-06-25T13:17:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2439964849,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI0Mzk5NjQ4NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2439964849","actor":{"login":"bors[bot]","id":26634292,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjY2MzQyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","st
