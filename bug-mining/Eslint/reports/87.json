In fact, the current behavior is that ESLint ignores the directive comment entirely and doesn't disable anything.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nESLint should report an error when an `eslint-disable-line` or `eslint-disable-next-line` directive comment spans multiple lines, to inform the user that their directive isn't doing anything so that the user can fix the problem.\r\n\r\nThis was discussed in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9745#discussion_r158462665 when block comment support for `disable-line` directives was added. The sentiment at the time was that we couldn't make multi-line `disable-line` directives an error then since it would be a breaking change, so we decided to warn about them at the time with the plan to make them an error in the next major release.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10334/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10334/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
