Personally, I don't think using a plugin for this is a good solution in the long-term, because it breaks the boundaries between rules and prevents us from refactoring internal APIs.\r\n\r\nYes, I think.\r\n\r\nHowever, in my experience, a rule to warn unused disable comments was good. It tells me the unused disable comments in real-time on editors. Also, it can stop CI builds. It's configurable with `.eslintrc`.\r\nThere are best practices around directive comments (e.g. [specify a rule to disable](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/blob/master/docs/rules/no-unlimited-disable.md)), so I thought reasonable that `eslint-plugin-eslint-comments` plugin aggregates rules to enforce the best practices.\r\n\r\nIf..., I understand that it's opposite of ESLint philosophy, but if a public API to catch reports from other rules, it's useful. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexports.create = (context) => {\r\n    return {\r\n        onReport(report) {\r\n            console.log(report.ruleId, report.message, report.node, report.line, report.column)\r\n\r\n            // Cancel the report to return false.\r\n            return false\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a generalized system of `context.markVariableAsUsed(node)`.\r\n\r\nThe `context.markVariableAsUsed(node)` API cancels some reports of `no-unused-vars` rule. But `onReport` handler has more controllability. `react/jsx-uses-vars`, `eslint-comments/no-unused-disable`, and [node/this-in-event-handlers](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/issues/4) will be feasible with the API. Possibly, also overwriting of a part of indentation rule.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/326578925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1231916647,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyMzE5MTY2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1231916647","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7e06fe9397b5dd844c4c483079ba23f2d48bddce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/7e06fe9397b5dd844c4c483079ba23f2d48bddce","created_at":"2017-09-01T19:35:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-01T19:40:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T19:40:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9196","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9196/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9196/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9196/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9196","id":254733949,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTM4OTYwMzE0","number":9196,"title":"Fix:

of https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6190)\r\n\r\n`/* eslint-disable */` comments are useful to document when code is an exception to a given rule. If a piece of code was previously an exception, but now the rule is no longer being violated, it's useful to remove the comment so that it doesn't hide unintended problems in the future. Unfortunately, ESLint doesn't provide any way to detect unused comments, and it's not possible to do this with a custom rule using the public rule API because rules can't view the configurations of other rules to determine whether a directive is used.\r\n\r\nWhen this was discussed in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6190, there was consensus that if a behavior like this was added to core, it would have to be implemented as a CLI flag. The TSC [decided](https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/00824ca375f62abd5d98931a2fecc80cae811964/notes/2016/2016-07-07.md#httpsgithubcomeslinteslintissues6190) to wait for a prototype before determining whether to accept the feature. A few months later, the issue was closed because [`eslint-plugin-eslint-comments`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments) was released, which achieves the same behavior in a plugin by monkeypatching ESLint's APIs.\r\n\r\nI'd like to reopen discussion on this because I think this would still be a useful feature, and I don't think using a plugin that monkeypatches core APIs is an acceptable solution in the long term, given that it breaks down the boundaries that we enforce between rules.\r\n\r\n(Case in point: We recently refactored the `context.report` internals, causing `eslint-plugin-eslint-comments` to break because it was trying to monkeypatch an API that no longer existed (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9193). We ended up adding [this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/82d8b734acd44b0c320d0ab24ce3dff92120d735/lib/linter.js#L799-L810) and [this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/82d8b734acd44b0c320d0ab24ce3dff92120d735/lib/linter.js#L853-L869) to prevent the monkeypatches in `eslint-plugin-eslint-comments` from breaking, but those are hacks and I'd like to get rid of them.)\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add a `--report-unused-disable-directives` CLI flag (along with corresponding `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` options in `CLIEngine` and `Linter`). When the flag is enabled, ESLint adds a new reported problem with error severity when it encounters an unused `eslint-disable` comment (or variants like `eslint-disable-line`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've created a prototype implementation (#9250). The implementation is actually fairly simple -- most of the diff in the PR comes from additional tests, docs, and passthrough options.\r\n\r\nThere are a few edge cases to consider -- I've written a bit about them below.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Edge cases</summary>\r\n\r\nDefinitions:\r\n\r\n* \"unused directive\": A directive that would prevent errors from being reported, but no errors were actually reported, so it didn't suppress anything.\r\n* \"redundant directive\": A directive that has no effect because the list of disabled rules is the same before and after applying it.\r\n\r\nUnused directives would need to be detected in core, since they depend on whether other rules report errors. Redundant directives could be detected by external rules (although they would sometimes have to use strange report locations to prevent their own reports from being suppressed).  Because of this, I decided that the flag should only cause unused directives to be reported. Redundant directives are not reported unless they are also unused.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n1. First comment is unused, second comment is unused and redundant\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    /* eslint-disable */\r\n    /* eslint-disable */\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. First comment is unused, second comment is redundant\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    /* eslint-disable */\r\n    /* eslint-disable */\r\n    (reported problem)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. First comment is unused\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    /* eslint-disable foo */\r\n    /* eslint-disable */\r\n    (reported problem from foo)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

The version of ESLint you are using.\r\n\r\n- 4.8.0\r\n\r\n### The problem you want to solve.\r\n\r\nAs a great work of @not-an-aardvark, #9371 added `--reportUnusedDisableDirectives` CLI option. It's useful in order to detect unused disable directives which can hide errors unintentionally.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, we cannot enable the feature with config files (e.g. `.eslintrc.json`). As a result, there is no simple way to enable the feature equally on CI and the editors of team members. I have to write npm-scripts and config files of several editors.\r\n\r\nIt's convenient if we can configure the feature with config files.\r\n\r\n### Your take on the correct solution to problem.\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds a top-level property: `reportUnusedDisableDirectives`. It has a number or a string as their value as same as rules.\r\n\r\n- `0` or `\"off\"` ... ESLint does not report unused disable directives. This is default.\r\n- `1` or `\"warn\"` ... ESLint reports unused disable directives as warning.\r\n- `2` or `\"error\"` ... ESLint reports unused disable directives as error.
