We can still get a huge win here if we replace the full linting process with a read-and-report process for unchanged files with errors.\r\n\r\nFull lint process (done on any file with errors even after linting once):\r\n\r\n1. Read file from filesystem\r\n2. Parse file contents\r\n3. Prepare to lint (build selector events, set up scope analysis and visitor keys, etc.)\r\n4.

In other words, wouldn't the cache process still work as expected (although maybe the timing of the autofix relative to the caching wouldn't)? Or are you concerned not about caching not working as expected but rather about the caching not being as effective as it could be due to the timing of autofixes?
