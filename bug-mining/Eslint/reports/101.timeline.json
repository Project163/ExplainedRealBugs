I think `const { foo_bar: fooBar } = baz` is harder to read and noisier.\r\n\r\nOne case that also comes up a lot in the app I work on is somebody picking off properties from object (perhaps from a remote api) in order to use rest destructuring - I don't think this code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst {some_property, some_other_one, ...rest} = remoteObject;\r\n// do something with rest\r\n```\r\n\r\n is improved by:\r\n```js\r\nconst {some_property: someProperty, some_other_one: someOtherOne, ...rest} = remoteObject;\r\n// do something with rest\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint-disable camelcase */\r\nconst {some_property, some_other_one, ...rest} = remoteObject;\r\n/* eslint-enable camelcase */\r\n// do something with rest\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also useful for object shorthand, when you're taking some remote data that has snake cased property names and using that for a subsequent request - for example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  getIframeURL() {\r\n    const {title, some_other_param} = this.props;\r\n    const queryParams = qs.stringify({\r\n      title,\r\n      some_other_param,\r\n    });\r\n    return `${IFRAME_URL}?${queryParams}`;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwithout modifying the rule this becomes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  getIframeURL() {\r\n    const {title, some_other_param: someOtherParam} = this.props;\r\n    const queryParams = qs.stringify({\r\n      title,\r\n      some_other_param: someOtherParam,\r\n    });\r\n    return `${IFRAME_URL}?${queryParams}`;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is just more typing, and no more readable or
