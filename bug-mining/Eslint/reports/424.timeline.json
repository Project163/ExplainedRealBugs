(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nAdded a new rule `no-unsafe-optional-chaining` which proposed by @mysticatea  #13431\r\n\r\nThis rule will catch cases that may possibly TypeError when using `optional chaining`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar obj = {};\r\n\r\n// TypeError\r\n\r\n(obj?.foo).bar;\r\n\r\n(obj?.foo)();\r\n\r\n(obj?.foo)`template`;\r\n\r\nnew (obj?.foo)();\r\n\r\nclass A extends obj?.foo {};\r\n\r\n[...obj?.foo];\r\n\r\nbar(...obj?.foo);\r\n\r\nnew Bar(...obj?.foo);\r\n\r\n1 in obj?.foo;\r\n\r\nvar { a } = obj?.foo;\r\n\r\nvar [a] = obj?.foo;\r\n\r\n// [edited]\r\nfoo instanceof obj?.prop\r\n\r\nfor (foo of obj?.prop);\r\n\r\n[{ foo } = obj?.prop] = [];\r\n\r\nwith (obj?.prop);\r\n\r\n// [edited] - handle logical result.\r\n\r\n(obj?.foo ?? obj?.bar)();\r\n\r\n(foo || obj?.foo)();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd by the option `disallowArithmeticOperators: true` it also catches the operation which possibly results in unexpected NaN. - [comment](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13431#issuecomment-647141087)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nobj?.foo * bar;\r\nobj?.foo - bar;\r\nobj?.foo + bar;\r\nobj?.foo % bar;\r\nobj?.foo **
