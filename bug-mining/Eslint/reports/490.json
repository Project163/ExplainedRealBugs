I can't speak for `char`, because I don't use that anywhere - but I do use `.native` and `int` as identifiers/property names, and these work perfectly fine in everyone's favorite ES3 engine, IE 6 (and presumably in many of the others). I use `.native` in the runtime code path of `resolve`, which has extensive usage, so I'm pretty confident it doesn't actually throw a runtime error anywhere that matters.\r\n\r\nThis parsing error means I can't upgrade to eslint 8 on `resolve` or `es-abstract` (so far; i've only tested a dozen or two out of my ~350 packages) without making an undesirable and unnecessary code change.\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\nAdd a parserOption that allows specific reserved words to parse as identifiers or property names anyways (it could apply to any ecmaVersion). This would be a generic escape hatch, that would allow anyone to lint code that works on what most implementations are: not precisely matching any arbitrary spec edition.\r\n\r\nI tried adding `parserOptions.allowReserved: true`, but this doesn't seem to do it.\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nSorry for not realizing this would be the consequence sooner :-)","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
