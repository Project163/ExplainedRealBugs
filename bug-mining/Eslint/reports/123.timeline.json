@LJNeon -- no, there hasn't been any progress made on this so far. In general, any progress will appear on the issue.\r\n\r\nI think the bug here is that the rule doesn't apply the `function` type to async functions, since it's currently just checking [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/99fb7d30bea09c37c5125df237fc19d5bf46b4aa/lib/rules/padding-line-between-statements.js#L381) whether the first token of the declaration is a `function` token.\r\n\r\nThis will hopefully be fixed soon.
