This rule looks to me like a place where suggestions make sense and should be simple enough to implement for the start.\r\n\r\n**What rule do you want to change?**\r\n\r\n`no-unsafe-negation`\r\n\r\n**Does this change cause the rule to produce more or fewer warnings?**\r\n\r\nsame\r\n\r\n**How will the change be implemented? (New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nnew default behavior\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint no-unsafe-negation: \"error\"*/\r\n\r\nif (!key in object) {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nJust an error without the autofix. The fixer was recently removed in #12157 because it was changing behavior.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\nAn error with two suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion would be to negate the whole relational expression. This changes behavior, but probably from a bug to the intended one (that's how the removed fixer was working):\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint no-unsafe-negation: \"error\"*/\r\n\r\nif (!(key in object)) {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second suggestion would be to make the existing intended behavior explicit, by wrapping the negation in parentheses, which is a documented exception allowed by this rule and does not produce an error after the fix:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*eslint no-unsafe-negation: \"error\"*/\r\n\r\nif ((!key) in object) {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes.","closed_by":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12591/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12591/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
