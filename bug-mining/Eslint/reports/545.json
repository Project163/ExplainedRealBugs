The available directives (including code example for each)\r\n2. The differences between directive behaviours\r\n3. How to add justification to directives (example for each directive type)\r\n4. Link to the `--no-ignore-lines` argument that can disable them again\r\n5. Links to any configuration settings that may affect behaviour of directives\r\n6. List of rules that lint directives (if any)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nShould there be a rule/setting to require all directives to have justifications then that would be good to mention that as well.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
