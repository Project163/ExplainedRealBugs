ESLint version\n\n9.26.0\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nFollowing the [discussion](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/discussions/19677)\nWould it be possible to add another flag to not fail the script in such scenarios where a dev fixes a violation but not update the eslint-suppressions.json file? We have a multi timezone team, but we also have strict ownership of ESLint related files confined to a very small set of people to make sure no one modifies any ESLint config without prior permission. This ensures that no one is adding any new violation in the eslint-suppressions.json file without permission. But that would be a bit problematic if the ESLint config owners are done for the day and anyone working late hours/different timezone might need to have their PRs checked-in, and it requires owner approval.\nIn such cases, we would like to let the script run without removing the violation entry in eslint-suppressions.json. If they introduce any new violation, then we would definitely want to fail the script and restrict merging the PR.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nESLint should not always fail with a non-zero code when an ESLint violation is fixed but `eslint-suppressions.json` isn't updated. \n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19723/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
