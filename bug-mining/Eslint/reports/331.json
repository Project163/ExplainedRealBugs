This creates an annoying user-experience for sharable configs that adds support for non-JS environments. For example, if someone wants to use my [`eslint-config-xo-typescript`](https://github.com/xojs/eslint-config-xo-typescript) shareable config, they need to run ESLint with `eslint . --ext=ts`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to specify an extension in the ESLint config. This makes it possible to create a shareable config that can be used directly without having to use any CLI flags.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n\textensions: [\r\n\t\t'md'\r\n\t]\r\n\trules: {\r\n\t\t// …\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't see any downside with supporting this. And it would also make it easier to use ESLint with non-JS files in non-CLI situations like editors and with wrappers like XO and Standard.","closed_by":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10828/reactions","total_count":90,"+1":74,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":8,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
