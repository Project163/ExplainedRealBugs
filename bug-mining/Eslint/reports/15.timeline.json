a long time, rules have had a slight usability issue where the `parent` property of a node is only present after a node is traversed and its listeners have been invoked. This can lead to confusing issues (e.g. https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9101) where a function call on a node can change behavior depending on whether the node has been traversed.\r\n\r\nPreviously, there has been discussion about adding the `parent` property during the scope analysis traversal (https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/27). However, I realized there's a much easier solution: We can just defer all rule listener calls until after traversal is complete.\r\n\r\nThe current traversal logic looks roughly like this (pseudocode):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor each node in the AST in traversal order:\r\n    node.parent = parentNode\r\n    for each rule listener that matches the node:\r\n        invoke the listener on the node\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could change it to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor each node in the AST in traversal order:\r\n    node.parent = parentNode\r\n    for each rule listener that matches the node:\r\n        push (listener, node) into a FIFO queue\r\n\r\nfor each (listener, node) pair in the queue:\r\n    invoke the listener on the node\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe effect is that all `parent` properties would be present for all rule listeners.\r\n\r\nWe would need to evaluate the performance effects of doing this. I suspect that most of the time spent traversing the AST is a result of enumerating the children of a node, so after all the nodes have already been enumerated in order, I don't think invoking a function on a small fraction of the nodes will create a big performance problem. (Actually, this might allow us to move scope analysis into the same traversal too, since rules wouldn't be able to observe the scope until the traversal is complete.)\r\n\r\n~~Note that rules can observe the AST before traversal starts, so they would still be able to observe nodes without a `parent` property.~~ (edit: actually, this can be avoided.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9122/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-21T21:00:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T21:00:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava/issues/179","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava/issues/179/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava/issues/179/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava/issues/179/events","html_url":"https://github.com/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava/issues/179","id":258908200,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTg5MDgyMDA=","number":179,"title":"Maximum
