That means both the current `ESLint` and `FlatESLint` classes will still be used, however, they both won't be accessible via the API. The intent was for `ESLint` in v9.0.0 to be `FlatESLint`, with the current `ESLint` hidden.\r\n\r\nBased on how people are starting to integrate with `FlatESLint`, I don't think we can make this drastic of a change without significant problems for the ecosystem.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nI'd like to propose that we start exporting a `LegacyESLint` class from the `/use-at-your-own-risk` entrypoint that is a duplicate of the current `ESLint` class. I'd like to do this before ESLint v9.0.0 to help prepare people. The idea is for the `ESLint` class to always be the \"blessed\" version that is officially supported while providing both `FlatESLint` and `LegacyESLint` through v9.0.0.\r\n\r\nSo in v8.x, we would have:\r\n\r\n* `ESLint` (equivalent of `LegacyESLint`) as the officially supported API\r\n* `FlatESLint` for flat config in `/use-at-your-own-risk`\r\n* `LegacyESLint` for eslintrc in `/use-at-your-own-risk`\r\n\r\nThen, in v9.x, we would swap the official API and have:\r\n\r\n* `ESLint` (equivalent of `FlatESLint`) as the officially supported API\r\n* `FlatESLint` for flat config in `/use-at-your-own-risk`\r\n* `LegacyESLint` for eslintrc in `/use-at-your-own-risk`\r\n\r\nAnd in v10.0.0, we would remove both `FlatESLint` and `LegacyESLint`.\r\n\r\nI think this approach would allow the ecosystem to make a more gradual transition away from eslintrc functionality.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nIf approved, I think we should prioritize getting this work done to aid in the transition to flat config.","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17340/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
