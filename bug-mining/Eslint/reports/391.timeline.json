you for bringing this to our attention. We should change this terminology where it exists in our project (in a backwards-compatible way so that we don't break existing configs). In doing a search of our codebase, I'm not seeing these terms used anywhere except in the `id-blacklist` rule. \r\n\r\nThoughts on an alternative name? `disallowed-id`, maybe?\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we as a team decided on alternative terms to use going forward. \"allow list\" and \"deny list\" (as suggested in the article shared by the issue author) seem like good terms to me.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I actually think we should rename it to `id-denylist`.

Did you really just force users to update their ESLint configs because an English compound word happens to include the word \"black\"…?\r\n\r\nLook, your Code of Conduct is your thing and all, but introducing a breaking change because the use of a particular word could *potentially* offend people who don't understand what the word actually means? That's going too far.\r\n\r\nI know this comment will be 👎 'd to hell because this area of cyberspace is dominated by people who're super PC and all, but for the love of God, at least provide links to precedent cases of ostensibly \"problematic\" language actually causing problems.
