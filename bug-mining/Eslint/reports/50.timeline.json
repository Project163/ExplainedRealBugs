Code like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst foo = { a: 1, b: 2 };\r\n({\r\n    ...foo,\r\n    ...foo\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n...is effectively doing the same thing as code like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n({\r\n    a: 1, b: 2,\r\n    a: 1, b: 2\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter is covered by `no-dupe-keys`, so I think it would be reasonable to flag the former too.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/360562198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/360562718","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9885#issuecomment-360562718","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9885","id":360562718,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDU2MjcxOA==","user":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-25T18:51:22Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T18:51:22Z","body":"Sure,

Bravo!  Since Node incorporates this as of Node 8.6, we're going ahead generating new projects with `experimentalObjectRestSpread: true` in the `.eslintrc` for their server-side code.\r\n\r\n@ljharb 2¢ re: duplicates:  I do think you're right about the duplicate spread symbol....thingies.  On one hand, I could see someone considering using something like `x = {...x, ...y, ...x}` to do what you might accomplish with `x = Object.assign({}, y, x)` today, and I guess there is some nuance you could achieve as far as key precedence.  But it still seems like a code smell to me-- at least with the example code being discussed-- since it obfuscates what's going on, making it look like there's mutation to worry about.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, it might be worthwhile to call this out with a distinct rule.  Besides, for every separate rule eslint contains, the better (and more productive) of an experience developers have when working with eslint integration in their text editor (i.e. because the error messages displayed are more precise and thus helpful)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/364312311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikermcneil","id":618009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxODAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil","html_url":"https://github.com/mikermcneil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikermcneil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1465861210,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ2NTg2MTIxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1465861210","actor":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-09T02:02:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
