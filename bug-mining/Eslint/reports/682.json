In order to allow AIs to interact with ESLint, we can provide an MCP server.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nWe can provide an MCP server as part of the `eslint` package. There's an [SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) that provides the basics. To start, I think it would make sense to provide a tool to lint files (linting text is challenging because we won't have the configuration file or a directory to pull from).\n\nThis could either be an existing flag (`npx eslint --mcp`) or a new binary (`npx eslint-mcp`). \n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19588/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
