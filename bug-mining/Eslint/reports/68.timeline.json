add this to `tsc-agenda` since this is an enhancement to core functionality.\r\n\r\n**TSC Summary:** ESLint resolves `@scope` inconsistently:\r\n\r\n- `extends: [\"@scope\"]` → `@scope/eslint-config`\r\n- `plugins: [\"@scope\"]` → `eslint-plugin-@scope`\r\n\r\nBecause we have received the request \"`@scope` → `@scope/eslint-config`\" in #3123 but never received the request \"`@scope` → `@scope/eslint-plugin`\".\r\nSo I propose the feature that ESLint resolves \"`plugins: [\"@scope\"]` to `@scope/eslint-plugin`\" for consistency.\r\n\r\n**TSC Question:** Should we accept

#398, fixes #423, fixes #521, closes #504.\r\n\r\nThis PR does:\r\n\r\n- Upgrades `vue-eslint-parser` to 3.x to support ESLint 5 and fix several bugs. See [v3.0.0](https://github.com/mysticatea/vue-eslint-parser/releases/) to check changes. Notable changes are:\r\n  - The AST of `slot-scope` and `<template scope>` attributes was changed. Those attributes are now parsed to `VSlotScopeExpression` node.\r\n  - The `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures.experimentalObjectRestSpread` option was removed as a result of upgrading `espree` to the latest.\r\n  - The `v-on` directive with no argument and an object expression (e.g., `v-on=\"{foo: bar}\"`) is now parsed to an `ObjectExpression` node correctly.\r\n  - HTML void element list was updated (https://github.com/mysticatea/vue-eslint-parser/commit/7de2b86dcb5740861a94b3c3b9a5e777f8ee7b28). Some tags of non-standard void elements now requires that end tags.\r\n  - The `parserOptions.parser` option can be `false`. If it's `false`, the parser skips parsing `<script>` elements completely.\r\n- Drops the support of Node.js 4.x (it was EOL already).\r\n- Drops the support of ESLint 3 and 4.\r\n- Fixes `html-indent` rule to support new `VSlotScopeExpression` node.\r\n- Removes all `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures.experimentalObjectRestSpread` options in our tests.\r\n\r\nPlus, we can move this plugin to `@vue/eslint-plugin` now. [`@vue` shorthand](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9903) has been supported since ESLint 5.0.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/issues/532/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/issues/532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1871573256,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTg3MTU3MzI1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1871573256","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-27T16:33:23Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1871573295,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4NzE1NzMyOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1871573295","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-27T16:33:24Z","label":{"name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
