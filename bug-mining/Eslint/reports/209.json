Please include the actual source code causing the issue, as well as the command that you used to run ESLint.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction foo(arg) {\r\n  throw new Error(\"Debugging...\");\r\n\r\n  if (!arg) {\r\n    return; // < This return incorrectly gets removed by auto-fix\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  console.log(arg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\nUsing eslint.org/demo link above\r\n\r\nI added a `throw` statement to the top of my function to aid debugging, and the critical return statement from later in the code was dropped which I only discovered after removing the `throw` statement and strange errors occurring.\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\n\r\n`return;` statement should be flagged in unreachable code if and only if it would be flagged in equivalent reachable code. (At least that's how I read [the comment in the source code](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/8684f4646da33bfe81e8f7f8c2d1af8b31065564/lib/rules/no-useless-return.js#L102-L108).)\r\n\r\nIf we were to remove the `throw` line, the `return;` statement would not be flagged; therefore it should not be flagged with the `throw` statement present.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\n`5:5 Unnecessary return statement.` and fixed code removes the `return` statement. (See eslint.org/demo link)\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\r\n\r\nThis is currently beyond my ESLint skillset.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
