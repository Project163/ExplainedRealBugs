(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nNew default behavior for `args: \"after-used\"` option: Report all unused parameters which occur after the last used parameter. This would be done as 1 lint message per unused parameter.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not really a breaking change:\r\n* When the user has no unused parameters after the last used parameter, the rule will continue not to report any violations.\r\n* When the user has at least one unused parameter after this last used parameter, we currently report 1 parameter at a time.\r\n    * When the user removes the unused parameter, we report the next unused parameter. Net effect for the user is to (eventually) see lint messages for all unused parameters after the last used parameter.\r\n    * This proposal is just to report them all at once.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint no-unused-vars: [\"error\", { \"args\": \"after-used\" }] */\r\nfunction (a, b, c, d, e) {\r\n    c();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more examples, see [demo](https://eslint.org/demo/#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).\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nFor code block above: Reports that `e` is unused.\r\n\r\nFor demo: See lint results.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\nFor code block above: Reports that `d`, and `e` are all unused.\r\n\r\n* `a`, `b`, `d`, and `e` are unused.\r\n* But `d` and `e` are after the last used parameter (`c`).\r\n* So report both `d` and `e`.\r\n\r\nFor demo: See comments in code.\r\n\r\nNote: `args: \"all\"` works correctly and needs no changes.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nI'll champion.\r\n\r\nIf there's a strong reason for reporting only one of the unused arguments (and no, \"the docs say so\" doesn't count, that's circular reasoning), that can be expressed here as part of a :-1: to this proposal.","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9909/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9909/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
