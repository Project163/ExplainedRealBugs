(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nCurrently, `sort-imports` does two checks. One is always on, the other is optional. I would like to only use the optional part.\r\n\r\nOne part is that it checks the order of import statements. This can’t be turned off. I would like to check this using [import/order](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/order.md), which offers more advanced features.\r\n\r\nThe part of the rule I would like to use, is the sorting of the imported members.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to split the distinct `memberSort` option into a separate rule: `sort-import-members`.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Builtins\r\nimport { join, resolve } from 'path';\r\n\r\n// External\r\nimport { map } from 'lodash';\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\n`sort-imports` will cause conflicts with `import/order`, but also make sure import members are sorted nicely.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\n`sort-imports` should be disabled to prevent conflicts with `import/order`.\r\n\r\n`sort-import-members` will ensure the imported members are sorted, as `sort-imports` does now.","closed_by":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11019/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
