I'm not sure how to do this with the new flat configuration files.\r\n\r\nThe second is to set `globalReturn` like this:\r\n```js\r\nexport default [\r\n    \"eslint:all\",\r\n    {\r\n        \"languageOptions\": {\r\n            \"parserOptions\": {\r\n                \"ecmaFeatures\": {\r\n                    \"globalReturn\": true\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting `globalReturn` works, so I guess this issue is invalid.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this were a little easier to set up like by specifying the `node` environment if that's still possible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the `.cjs` extension *should* imply that the contents are a commonjs module file instead of only a commonjs file.  It's a new (-ish) extension after all.\r\n\r\nJust configuring the rule might be best:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default [\r\n    \"eslint:all\",\r\n    {\r\n        rules: {\r\n            strict:

@jzinn, thanks for the issue! \r\n\r\n> > This rule has a string option:\r\n> > \r\n> > * \"safe\" (default) corresponds either of the following options:\r\n> >   \r\n> >   * \"global\" if ESLint

new config system works correctly in this case, as it automatically sets [`sourceType: \"commonjs\"`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/6ba269ed673f965d081287b769c12beeb5f98887/lib/config/default-config.js#L66) for `.cjs` files.\r\n\r\nThe problem is in the `strict` rule since its logic around CommonJS is based on `parserOptions.ecmaFeatures.globalReturn` field, which is in the new config format dropped in favor of `languageOptions.sourceType = \"commonjs\"`.\r\n\r\nI prepared PR https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/16308 that should fix this problem.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1246620704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7384836039,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKjKDc5RyotizwAAAAG4K6fH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7384836039","actor":{"login":"jzinn","id":79761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn","html_url":"https://github.com/jzinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-14T11:21:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7384836047,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKjKDc5RyotizwAAAAG4K6fP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7384836047","actor":{"login":"jzinn","id":79761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn","html_url":"https://github.com/jzinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-14T11:21:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7406388603,"node_id":"CE_lADOAKjKDc5RyotizwAAAAG5dIV7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7406388603","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-16T21:49:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7406389516,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKjKDc5RyotizwAAAAG5dIkM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/7406389516
