commit aims to fix the issues described in #12507 by removing the\r\nassumption that POSIX style filePaths are supplied by messages.\r\n\r\nThe tests for this are also updated to run on both Windows and POSIX\r\nbased systems. The results can be seen by running ESLint with the JUnit\r\nformatter on a Windows system.\r\n\r\nFull details can be seen in the issue mentioned above.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    ESLint adheres to the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is the purpose of this pull request?

(Give an overview)**\r\nI changed the function `pathWithoutExt(filePath)` so that it does not assume POSIX style paths. Instead it will allow Node to determine which style of path to expect (POSIX or Windows) based on the OS.\r\n\r\nFrom looking at the original PR it seems that this change to assume POSIX was done after the changes were approved, and might have been to force tests to pass (but I did not verify this).\r\n\r\nHence, I also updated the tests for the JUnit formatter so that they should run correctly on both Windows and *Nix machines by passing in an OS relevant `suppliedFilePath` to the test, and verifying with an OS relevant `expectedClassName`.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\nTest sanity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/547859976","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12507#issuecomment-547859976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12507","id":547859976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Nzg1OTk3Ng==","user":{"login":"thewalla07","id":9087218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODcyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9087218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07","html_url":"https://github.com/thewalla07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thewalla07/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T11:37:43Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T11:37:43Z","body":"Working
