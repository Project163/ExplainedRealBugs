This combination is now removed from the example in the docs, but it still works and both values would be tested.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are still some differences when compared to what can be used in error tests. This would probably require additional discussion and it seems better to make separate PRs (if needed):\r\n\r\n* `suggestions` cannot be a number, e.g., `suggestions: 2` to just test that there are 2 suggestions and nothing more. A workaround is `suggestions: [{}, {}]`.\r\n* A suggestion as an element of the `suggestions` array can't be just a string that would be treated as `desc`.\r\n* `desc` can't be a regex.\r\n* there is no check whether the suggestion's fix produces a valid code or a parsing error.\r\n* RuleTester doesn't seem to support suggestions that don't have a fix. This raises a question, is a suggestion that doesn't include a fix allowed by the API?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"snyk-bot","id":19733683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzMzNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19733683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/snyk-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T01:42:41Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T01:42:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basics/vector/issues/113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basics/vector","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basics/vector/issues/113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basics/vector/issues/113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basics/vector/issues/113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/basics/vector/pull/113","id":536091316,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzUxNjg0NDg3","number":113,"title":"[Snyk] Upgrade eslint from 6.7.0 to 6.7.2","user":{"login":"snyk-bot","id":19733683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzMzNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19733683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/snyk-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1161876286,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTYxODc2Mjg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/basics/vector/labels/released","name":"released","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-12-11T01:42:40Z","updated_at":"2020-01-05T12:41:35Z","closed_at":"2020-01-05T12:36:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"repository":{"id":144403143,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ0MDMxNDM=","name":"vector","full_name":"basics/vector","private":false,"owner":{"login":"basics","id":42298493,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyMjk4NDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42298493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics","html_url":"https://github.com/basics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basics/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/basics/vector","description":"This library provides 3D Vector in js including arithmetic operator overloading (+ -
