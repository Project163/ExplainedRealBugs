(put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Changes an existing rule #12235\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `Array.prototype.flatMap` to the list of targeted methods in `array-callback-return`, but only when `ecmaVersion` is set to `2019` or higher, in order to minimize potential breaking change impact.\r\n\r\nThis can produce **more** errors by default (for an ecmaVersion >= 2019 configuration only).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    If the item you've checked above has a template, please paste the template questions below and answer them.

on?**\r\n\r\nWould be probably more correct to check enabled environments instead of the ecmaVersion, but that isn't possible at the moment as far as I know.\r\n\r\nThe diff looks big, most of it is just copy & paste to a different
