Environment\n\nNode version: v20.12.2\nnpm version: v10.8.1\nLocal ESLint version: v9.4.0 (Currently used)\nGlobal ESLint version: Not found\nOperating System: win32 10.0.22000\n\n\n### What parser are you using?\n\n@typescript-eslint/parser\n\n### What did you do?\n\nWe have lot of parallel tasks happening on CI, one of those being eslint and another - a build that uses `proper-lockfile` package to create a lock directory. If the lock is released at the same time as `eslint` walks the directory gathering the source files, eslint will crash. See #18952 for details where the crash originates (just that the PR was made just before the fswalk dependency was changed).\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nA directory vanishing while the fs walk is done shouldn't crash the process - seem logical that the walk process will ignore such case.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\n```\nOops! Something went wrong! :(\nESLint: 9.4.0\nError: ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir '/builds/path/to/the/directory.lock'\n```\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n-\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nI was able to reproduce the issue by doing\n\n```\nwhile (true) {\n    mkdir(\"src/foo.lock\");\n    sleep(100ms);\n    rmdir(\"src/foo.lock\");\n    sleep(100ms);\n}\n```\n\nwith this running in background, the eslint process in my big monorepo crashed around every 4th time.","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
