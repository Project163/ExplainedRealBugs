The configuration looks like this, where each global is given a boolean value:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"globals\": {\r\n    \"Foo\": true,\r\n    \"Bar\": false,\r\n    \"baz\": false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a boolean value can be used in a `/* global */` comment directive to enable globals for a file:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* global Foo: true, Bar: false, baz: false */\r\n```\r\n\r\nA value of `true` indicates that a global is allowed to be rewritten, and a value of `false` indicates that a global is read-only. This behavior is inherited from JSHint and JSLint.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nThere are a few disadvantages to the current behavior:\r\n\r\n* Globals from an inherited config file cannot be turned off; they can only be reconfigured to `true` (rewritable) and `false` (read-only). This will make it more complex to enable a set of globals by default in the future (e.g. when we start supporting ES6 by default), because users will not be able to disable the globals.\r\n* The correlation between `true`/`false` and \"rewritable\"/\"read-only\" is somewhat arbitrary, which makes it confusing to users. Anecdotally, I had been on the ESLint team for almost a year before I learned that `/* global Foo: false */` would make `Foo` read-only. (I had previously thought that it would turn off `Foo`.)\r\n\r\nThe root cause of these problems is that there are three possible states of a global (\"not present\", \"present but read-only\", and \"present and writable\") but we only allow them to be configured with a boolean field.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nWe should start allowing string values for globals. The possible values are (bikesheddable):\r\n\r\n* `readonly` to indicate that a global is read-only (same as `false`)\r\n* `writable` to indicate that a global is writable (same as `true`)\r\n* `off` to indicate that a global is not present\r\n\r\nTo encourage people to use the new forms, we should deprecate the use of `true` and `false` for configuring globals. (However, for backwards compatibility, `true` and `false` would continue to be supported without a warning for the foreseeable future.)","closed_by":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9940/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9940/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
