Sure, the fulfilled promise could have made `AnotherReferenceTosomeObj.bar = \"something specific\";`, but that **should** get over-written by `someObj.bar = \"whatever\";`\r\n\r\nTo assume that the promise does this on a **\"might\"**, and invoke an eslint error, seems like an attempt to oversimplify async programming to me.\r\n\r\nIf eslint isn't sophisticated enough to point out BOTH lines of code, that are \"racing\" to overwrite something (race condition), then it probably needs to keep its might-suspicions to itself (until it gains that sophistication). Don't block my build on a \"might\". It takes two to race.
