Just by reading it it's not possible to determine that the cause is an empty `undefined` vs. an `[]` vs. `[undefined]`.\n\nI think we could consider improving the error message for missing `export default` by throwing an error with a more descriptive message from a place that processes config files, possibly here:\n\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/dc34f94a2ed25b37ac4aafcabed7bfae582db77e/lib/config/config-loader.js#L202\n\nAs for missing `module.exports`, I think the only way to align the behavior would be to disallow empty `{}` (but allow empty `[]` as a way to lint only for syntax errors). That would be a breaking change, though.\n\n@eslint/eslint-team
