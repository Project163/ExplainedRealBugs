Make redirects work on new.eslint.org/docs. I believe this would be ideal, but not sure if it is possible with Netlify's proxying.\r\n2. Disable trailing slash redirects on docs-eslint.netlify.app so that it returns 404 on missing/extra trailing slash, if that's possible on Netlify.\r\n3.  Allow all URLs with and without a trailing slash, but use only domain-relative links (start with `/`) everywhere. It would probably be good to also decide for each page what would be its canonical URL, and generate `rel=\"canonical\"` link tags and the sitemap accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1136465248/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1138548970","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15844#issuecomment-1138548970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15844","id":1138548970,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5D3ODq","user":{"login":"amareshsm","id":30730124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzMwMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30730124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm","html_url":"https://github.com/amareshsm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amareshsm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-26T12:58:31Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T12:58:31Z","body":"In our case can't we use netlify’s Pretty URLs feature by any means?

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\n* Added `src/src.json` that overrides default permalinks. This is the same as [`docs/docs.json`](https://github.com/eslint/website/blob/9843f3caa7715d92fe5cc4d399921e1faae579f1/docs/docs.json) on the current site. Per [the data cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/), this shouldn't affect templates that have a permalink in the front matter (like the sitemap, robots, etc.), which is good.\r\n* With this change, `page.url` includes the `.html` suffix, so I added `prettyURL` filter that removes `.html`, and used the filter in places where we're generating urls from `page.url`. Namely: docs index, sitemap, canonical links, and og:url.\r\n* With the above changes, links didn't work locally (`http://localhost:2023`), because browser-sync doesn't serve `foo.html` by default when `foo` is requested, so I had to add `\"html\"` extension in the browser-sync config through eleventy. Unfortunately, eleventy [shallow merges](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/blob/v1.0.1/src/EleventyServe.js#L78-L91) the added config, so this change overwrites all eleventy's browser-sync `server` settings, including [settings related to `pathPrefix`](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/blob/6ea19449c45dc024956d703161cb80a9bdfaa638/src/EleventyServe.js#L62-L76), resulting in a totally broken site. As those settings look fairly complex, instead of trying to replicate them I decided to remove `pathPrefix` when the site is generated by `npm start`.\r\n* I also updated components library links. Is that okay?\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nCheck that the links work well in the deployment preview, and that there are no trailing slash redirections.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004 -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1147561016","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15844#issuecomment-1147561016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15844","id":1147561016,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5EZmQ4","user":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-06T15:14:01Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T15:14:01Z","body":"> I think the first step here should be to find what is different between the current site setup and the new site setup.
