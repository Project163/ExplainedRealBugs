However, that is fairly limited in that you need to be running the CLI on a command line, so those who were using ESLint elsewhere (via the API or in an editor) need to use different methods of enabling flat config.\r\n\r\nAs we move forward, it seems like the ability to implement changes and let people opt-in will become increasingly important, and without a standard way to do this, we'll end up implementing special opt-in functionality on a per-feature basis.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nIntroduce feature flags into ESLint.\r\n\r\nFor the CLI, we'd add a `--flag` option that lets people pass these in:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpx eslint --flag v10_feature foo.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `ESLint` class, we'd add a new constructor option:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst eslint = new ESLint({\r\n    flags: [\"v10_feature\"]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the `Linter` class, we'd also add a new constructor option:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst linter = new Linter({\r\n    flags: [\"v10_feature\"]\r\n});\r\n```\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
