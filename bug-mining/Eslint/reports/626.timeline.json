(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nUpdated code that processes `/*eslint*/` comments (both in flat and eslintrc modes) to check if the rule has already been configured by another comment. In that case, the previous comment still applies, while the duplicate is reported as a lint error.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nThis doesn't cover cases where a rule appears multiple times in the same comment. Configuration comments are parsed by `levn` (with a fallback to JSON parsing), which allows duplicate keys in objects and just returns the last entry. Detecting these duplicates would probably require another tool or custom parsing. I think these cases are much less important than the cases with multiple comments.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004

ESLint version\n\n8.57.0\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nRight now, nothing in ESLint core stops [inline configs (configuration comments)](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-comments) from redundantly repeating the same configuration _option_ and/or _severity_ as already exists. This is similar to [unused disable directives](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#report-unused-eslint-disable-comments): they take up space and can be misleading.\n\n* [Playground of

What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nThe most straightforward change I can think of would be to add a new `--report-unused-inline-configs` / `reportUnusedInlineConfigs` (per the feature's primary naming in #18187) or `--report-unused-config-comments` / `reportUnusedConfigComments` (per the common alternate naming).\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nInspired by #18218, thanks @inga-lovinde 😄 \n\nEdit: https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/121 was filed and accepted for
