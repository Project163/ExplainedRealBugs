Please include the actual source code causing the issue, as well as the command that you used to run ESLint.**\r\n\r\nIn this case, I have a configuration that is inside of my node_modules, or another subdirectory. Using the `--config` flag, I use that file directly rather than having a config in the root of my project. In the file, as above, I've got a glob that should match some files. However, that glob is not matched correctly. In particular, in `getConfigVector` in `config`, we use `config.baseDirectory` to compute a relative path. In this case, because the config is in a sibling directory, that relative path starts with something like `../`, which makes the glob always fail.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the source code below: -->\r\n```js\r\nN/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\n```bash\r\neslint --config ./configs/.eslintrc.json .\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\nIt seems likely that if someone is using `--config`, they probably want the globs to be computed relative to `cwd` rather than wherever that config happens to be on disk.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\nGlobs are computed relative to the config's location on disk, which makes them not work super well.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull

bug?**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/496947952","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11577#issuecomment-496947952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11577","id":496947952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Njk0Nzk1Mg==","user":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-29T13:57:42Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T13:57:42Z","body":"I

Occasionally users will create issues about it, but it's easy to resolve and results in educating a user. Zero issues would be best, but we'd rather have issues about implementation problems than vulnerabilities and ReDoS. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in a little more info about why it's unsafe to convert backslashes...\r\n\r\nSince globs are converted to regular expressions, when backslashes are converted to forward slashes it can change the intent of the glob and match things that shouldn't be matched, or create a malicious regular expression that can lead to DoS.  I've seen many naive and clever attempts at guessing when backslashes should be converted, but there are so many different edge cases that it's just not worth the risk and headache - especially since globs are often joined to path parts before passing them to a matcher, which further complicates the guesswork of determining whether or not 1) slashes can be safely converted, and that 2) converting slashes will not change the intent of the glob pattern (and ultimately the regex).\r\n\r\nAlso fwiw, in case you're concerned about breaking people's configs and getting a bunch of issues.  Micromatch has something like 2.5m dependents, and believe me, we were cringing when we made the decision to enforce this with users. But I have to say it wasn't nearly as bad as we anticipated.  We'll get an issue about it every now and then... maybe 4-6 a year. But I don't recall seeing any issues about this in months, and we even have a tool that \"watches\" issues on every repository on GitHub so that we can be notified in near real-time when something needs to be triaged.\r\n\r\n(Please don't take my comment as an attempt to persuade you to use Micromatch. I don't expect that and wouldn't judge you for not switching. I just figured I'd drop by and share some things we've learned.)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/498178859/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jonschlinkert","id":383994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzk5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/383994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert","html_url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonschlinkert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/498193109","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11577#issuecomment-498193109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11577","id":498193109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODE5MzEwOQ==","user":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-03T09:58:43Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T09:58:43Z","body":"After some investigating, I don't think the switching by this issue is reasonable because Micromatch has the same behavior about `./` as Minimatch.

Two things: \r\n\r\n1. Your config is wrong in the second and third examples. You're passing a glob with a slash in it AND specifying `matchBase` in the options, which tells micromatch to only match against the basename of the file path. \r\n2. Micromatch gives you the ability to strip the leading `./` before matching.
