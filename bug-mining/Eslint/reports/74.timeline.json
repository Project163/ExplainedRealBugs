Summary**: We've had a few compatibility hacks in Linter for much of the 4.x release line, which we would like to remove. These appear to have been added due to [`eslint-plugin-eslint-comments`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments) needing to intercept lint reports as they are made. However, we now have the [`--report-unused-disable-directives`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#--report-unused-disable-directives) CLI flag, which should cover that use case. Comments in code suggest that we intend to remove the compatibility flags in a major release.\r\n\r\n**TSC Question**: Should we remove these compatibility hacks in ESLint
