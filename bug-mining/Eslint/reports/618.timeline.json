(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nUpdated `Linter` to accept `FlatConfigArray` as an argument. To do so, I added a new `configType` option that must be set to `\"flat\"`. When set to `\"flat\"`, the `defineRule`, `defineRules`, and `defineParser` methods all throw an error because there is no good way to mimic this functionality with flat config. (People can instead define a plugin directly in the config.) Ultimately, we'll end up removing these methods.\r\n\r\nI've only added enough tests to verify each of the initial paths for flat config. In a future pull request I'll work on converting the existing tests to work with flat config. I just don't want to wait too long before merging these changes in order to avoid conflicts.\r\n\r\nNote: These changes are a prerequisite for the `ESLint` class changes.\r\n\r\nTask list:\r\n\r\n- [x] Linting both with and without processors\r\n- [x] Environments do not work when `configType` is `\"flat\"`\r\n- [x] Globals added via comments are correctly added to the global scope\r\n- [x] Autofixing\r\n- [ ] ~~`context.parserPath` compatibility~~\r\n- [x] `context.languageOptions` doesn't exist\r\n- [x]  `languageOptions.ecmaVersion` is year-based (2015 instead of 6)\r\n- [x] `languageOptions.ecmaVersion` translates to `parserOptions.ecmaVersion`\r\n- [x] `languageOptions.ecmaVersion` adds globals for the appropriate version\r\n- [x]  `languageOptions.ecmaVersion: 3` only has ES3 globals\r\n- [x]  `languageOptions.sourceType: \"commonjs\"` adds Node.js globals\r\n- [x]  `languageOptions.sourceType: \"commonjs\"` switches parser options to parse global `return`\r\n- [x] Convert all eslintrc tests into flat config tests\r\n- [x] Update defaults (#14588)\r\n- [x] All tests passing\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nIs there any danger in merging this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15185/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1002812664","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15366#issuecomment-1002812664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15366","id":1002812664,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc47xbT4","user":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-29T23:29:42Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T23:29:42Z","body":"Good call.

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nI added configuration for the latest ECMAScript version to ESLint and updated Linter to use it instead of `espree.latestEcmaVersion` when resolving `\"latest\"` value of `languageOptions.ecmaVersion`.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nI didn't change the eslintrc logic:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/95075251fb3ce35aaf7eadbd1d0a737106c13ec6/lib/linter/linter.js#L553-L559\r\n\r\nbecause, in eslintrc configs, `ecmaVersion` is in `parserOptions`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// .eslintrc.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    parserOptions: {\r\n        ecmaVersion: \"latest\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthus, in this case, I think it makes more sense to keep getting the version from the parser.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004
