I think it's a good case for `eslint-disable` comments\r\n\r\nWhile trying that, I noticed that it seemed impossible to do that in a single comment, because of the other rule `no-fallthrough`. With the code\r\n```ts\r\nswitch (1) {\r\n\tcase x++:\r\n\tcase x++: {\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAdding in the eslint-disable comment above the second case, the no-fallthrough rule would start to trigger, probably because it disallows anything but consecutive lines. I didn't find a way to disable both rules in a single comment.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1026328230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dionysusnu","id":39664950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjY0OTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39664950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu","html_url":"https://github.com/Dionysusnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1026368931","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/15552#issuecomment-1026368931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15552","id":1026368931,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc49LSWj","user":{"login":"Dionysusnu","id":39664950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjY0OTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39664950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu","html_url":"https://github.com/Dionysusnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dionysusnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-01T00:59:33Z","updated_at":"2022-02-01T00:59:33Z","body":"> I can reproduce this with the default parser as well: online demo.\n\nHave you considered linking this demo in the issue format?
