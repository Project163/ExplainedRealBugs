I think we need a documented a way for all languages to transform/normalize their options before they are passed to the parser or to a rule.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nTwo possible solutions have been suggested in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/19003#discussion_r1796807702:\n\n1. We could consider allowing languages to provide a `normalizeLanguageOptions()` method. This method could be called either by the `Linter` for each a file, or in the `Config` constructor after `languageOptions` are validated and before the `Config` object is finalized. It would throw an error if the options cannot be normalized.\n2. We could return a value from `validateLanguageOptions()`. This means changing the method's signature without adding a new method. As noted in the comment, the naming would be weird in this case.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nAny other way to normalize language options that were not considered?","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19037/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
