This is probably intuitive for most people, but I was still initially expecting the base `data` object from `context.report({ data: {} })` to be used for all messages including suggestions, not just for the main error message.\r\n* Rule tester doesn't support interpolation for suggestions' messages. You can test either `desc` (the final text) or just `messageId`, but not `messageId` + `data`. If you pass `messageId` and `data`, the tester will check just `messageId` and ignore `data`, which is different from how it works with error messages.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\n*  It might be nice to clarify suggestion `data` in `working-with-rules.md`.\r\n* Improve rule tester to use suggestion's `data` provided in a test in the same way as it works with error's `data`: interpolate and compare final messages.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12606/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
