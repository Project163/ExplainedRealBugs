(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nAdded error handling around rule listener calls in `linter.js`. The error handler wrapper is added when `safe-emitter` listeners are created. This seemed like a good place for it since we have `ruleId` easily available.\r\n\r\nWhen extending caught error in try-catch of  `runRules` calls it is checked whether `ruleId` is available. If it's found we include it in the `error.message`. This seems safe and low-risk. \r\n\r\nThere were already few test cases available which nicely covered this case. I did not add any new test cases for this reason. \r\n\r\nExample error log generated by this implementation is found from issue description.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nCurrently the `ruleId` is wrapped with quotes, as in `Rule: \"some-plugin/some-rule\"` / `Rule: \"some-builtin-rule\"`. I'm not sure whether quotes should be removed.
