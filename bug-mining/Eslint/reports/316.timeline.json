for creating another issue. I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n* Wouldn't the hazard with `import * as foo from 'path'; Promise.resolve(foo)`also apply to any other object with an unexpected `then` method? To me, it doesn't seem specific to exported functions. For example, the following examples seem equally hazardous to me in the absence of `import()` syntax:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    import * as foo from 'path';\r\n    \r\n    Promise.resolve(foo);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    const foo = getSomeObject();\r\n    \r\n    Promise.resolve(foo);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    I could potentially see an argument for disallowing *all* functions called `then` regardless of whether they're exported (although this would have false positives for developers that intentionally implement thenables).\r\n\r\n* Could you elaborate on why you want to disallow other export names such as `default`? My concern here is that the reasons for which a user might want to disallow exporting `then` (it causes surprising behavior with `import()` ) are orthogonal to the reasons a user might want to disallow other export names (surprising behavior that would apply to any object, consistency, aesthetic preference, etc.) As a result, I wonder if it would be better to have a dedicated rule for the `then` case, and leave the other cases to `no-restricted-syntax` or a similar rule.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/393772996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/393773823","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10428#issuecomment-393773823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10428","id":393773823,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzc3MzgyMw==","user":{"login":"ljharb","id":45469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb","html_url":"https://github.com/ljharb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljharb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T06:21:35Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T06:21:35Z","body":"Yes, it definitely would apply to all objects - but Module Namespace objects are *special*, because as explained in the OP, they conceptually represent a static, frozen, representation of a module.

If I use `import * as foo from 'bar'; Promise.resolve(foo)`, then `foo` is still a static, frozen representation of a module -- it's just that `Promise.resolve` means something more complicated than \"create a Promise that fulfills with the given value\". The mistaken assumption in that code is in the use of `Promise.resolve`, not in the module object itself. `import('bar')` is different because the user never has access to the module namespace object in the first place, and we're in agreement that it's confusing for an expression like `import('bar')` to return something other than a promise for a module namespace object.\r\n\r\nMy concern about adding options here is that it could result in user confusion about the purpose of the rule. Effectively, the rule would be filling two different use cases: preventing `then` to avoid bugs, and preventing other configured names for consistency/aesthetics/etc. As a result, a user might end up mistakenly disabling the check for `then` because they misunderstand its importance, or (if we made it hard to accidentally disable) they might be confused about why a name was being disallowed if they weren't explicitly configuring it. We could use different error messages/documentation for `then` and for names configured elsewhere to clarify the problem, but at that point the complexity would be roughly the same as making two separate rules anyway.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't feel strongly about this point, so I'm open to adding options if other team members are in favor of the idea.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/393776617/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/393888542","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10428#issuecomment-393888542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10428","id":393888542,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzg4ODU0Mg==","user":{"login":"bmeck","id":234659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDY1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/234659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bmeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T13:56:53Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T13:56:53Z","body":"I'm fine with a rule just for `then` and a different one or follow on for other names/configuration.
