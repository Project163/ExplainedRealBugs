you for this issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is working as intended.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the rule `no-loop-func` is literally the rule which disallows all function declarations in loop. The purpose of the rule is avoidance of confusion by the fact that loop-blocks don't make any scope for variables.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\r\n    setTimeout(() => console.log(i)) // 3, 3, 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [Online demo](https://eslint.org/demo/#eyJ0ZXh0IjoiZm9yICh2YXIgaSA9IDA7IGkgPCAzOyArK2kpIHtcbiAgICBzZXRUaW1lb3V0KCgpID0+IGNvbnNvbGUubG9nKGkpKSAvLyAzLCAzLCAzXG59Iiwib3B0aW9ucyI6eyJwYXJzZXJPcHRpb25zIjp7ImVjbWFWZXJzaW9uIjo2LCJzb3VyY2VUeXBlIjoic2NyaXB0IiwiZWNtYUZlYXR1cmVzIjp7ImltcGxpZWRTdHJpY3QiOnRydWV9fSwicnVsZXMiOnsibm8tbG9vcC1mdW5jIjoyfSwiZW52Ijp7InNoYXJlZC1ub2RlLWJyb3dzZXIiOnRydWV9fX0=)\r\n\r\nSince ES2015, loop-blocks can make the scope for `let` and `const` variables. So the rule got some relaxing. The rule allows functions which don't use variables of outer scopes than the loop.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\r\n    setTimeout(() => console.log(i)) // 1,2,3; OK because the `i` is in the loop-block's scope.\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet outer = 0\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\r\n    setTimeout(() => console.log(outer)) // 3,3,3; Disallowed because the `outer` is not in the loop-block's scope.\r\n    outer += 1\r\n}\r\n\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {\r\n    setTimeout(() => console.log(outer)) // 3,3,3; OK because the `outer` is not modified after this loop.
