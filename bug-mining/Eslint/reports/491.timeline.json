For example, try to specify `globals: []` or `env: []`.\r\n\r\nThese are all RuleTester-specific properties:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b58096975935ec016d96dd5f333f059c270f26/lib/rule-tester/rule-tester.js#L118-L124\r\n\r\n`options` are validated in [runRuleForItem](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/06b58096975935ec016d96dd5f333f059c270f26/lib/rule-tester/rule-tester.js#L467), `errors` is validated in [testInvalidTemplate](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rule-tester/rule-tester.js#L643).\r\n\r\nAside from `code`, we can consider explicit validations for the remaining two properties, but I think we should limit the scope to only those that certainly cause throwing or failing the test if the type is invalid. Other changes would probably need a [RFC](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/742607458/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bmish","id":698306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/698306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish","html_url":"https://github.com/bmish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-14T05:13:38Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T05:13:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15425","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15425/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15425/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15425/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15425","id":1079321226,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAKjKDc4vzQDW","number":15425,"title":"fix:
