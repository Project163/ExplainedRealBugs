(Give an overview)**\r\nFix #12127 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried to solve issue #12127 by adding just `|| hasDoubleExcessParens()` everywhere, but it had a performance issue when checking `ArrayExpression`'s element nodes.\r\n\r\nSo, I made a new function(`hasExcessParensWithConsiderPrecedence`) which checks extra parens with considering the precedence of a node. This function checks `isParenthesisedTwice` only if the node surrounded by at least one extra paren. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nThis pr doesn't change the option's behavior that @mdjermanovic [mentioned](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12127#issuecomment-522782361).\r\n> There is also a question of options, do they allow just one pair or more.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-05T01:01:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-05T01:01:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12743","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12743/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12743/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12743/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12743","id":545351934,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzU5MjYwNzg4","number":12743,"title":"Update:
