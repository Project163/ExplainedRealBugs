Thanks @not-an-aardvark , I was doing `eslint ./*/ --ext .js --ignore-path .gitignore` which worked in 4.19 but was breaking with a similar looking error. Changing it to `eslint . --ext .js --ignore-path .gitignore` fixed it.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/404348627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wei","id":5880908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODA5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei","html_url":"https://github.com/wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/404349471","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10587#issuecomment-404349471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10587","id":404349471,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNDM0OTQ3MQ==","user":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-12T00:15:11Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T00:15:25Z","body":"I don't think an error is thrown for nonexistent paths in `.gitignore` or `.eslintignore`.
