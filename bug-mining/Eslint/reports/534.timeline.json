If ESLint is already outputting a warning that cannot be removed, the only purpose of delivering that data to a formatter is to output the same thing again. That seems unexpected to me. Or maybe it means we shouldn’t output a message by default and we should leave it up to formatters to output. This is what I need help resolving in my brain.

Whenever ESLint is run in a CLI, `stderr` is a perfectly standard place to put diagnostic messages like this one, and you're right that the formatter re-outputting it would be redundant. Unfortunately that makes the message inaccessible to non-CLI interfaces. Moving messages like this to the formatter puts CI tools and editor integrations back on a level playing field.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/913986855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/914736534","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14881#issuecomment-914736534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14881","id":914736534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc42hcWW","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-08T00:44:57Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T00:44:57Z","body":"> Moving messages like this to the formatter puts CI tools and editor integrations back on a level playing field.\r\n\r\nRight, but what about the transition?
