For instance:\n\n```js\n{\n    languageOptions: {\n        parse() {}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe work around this for parsers by not attempting to serialize an object if we can calculate an object ID for it (due to presence of `meta` property). However, it's not practical add `meta` on any object that might be passed into `languageOptions`, especially if that object is deeply nested. This leaves users and language plugin authors a bit stuck if they need a function to be passed in.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nWe can modify the current serialization logic to also check if a value has a `toJSON()` method (which is the standard way to indicate a different JSON serialization behavior for any object), and if so, call `toJSON()` instead of trying to serialize the object.\n\nThis would allow language plugin authors to place `toJSON()` on any object that can't be natively serialized and would allow more functionality to be available through `languageOptions`.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
