It seems they're using `babel-eslint`\r\n\r\nThis was indeed spotted with `@typescript-eslint/parser`. With `babel-eslint` there are no errors.\r\n\r\nIt seems that turning off this rule is common when using `@typescript-eslint/parser`, e.g. in [react-app config](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L89-L90). As this rule is not included in the `eslint:recommended` I don't think many will run into this.\r\n\r\nI think it is safe to close this issue without taking action. But on the other hand - this was the only rule of `eslint:all` which crashed when linting 164 repositories. Every other rule seemed stable. Having perfect score would be awesome. 💯

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nOld implementation relies that class constructor has body. Added a check to verify this before accessing the object in order to prevent null pointer. \r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nAs discussed on the ticket, it seems to be common practice to disable this rule when using typescript-parser. However I would rather avoid linter crash when this rule is enabled with specific parsers. Currently users will not see other erroneous cases in the same file due to linter crash.
