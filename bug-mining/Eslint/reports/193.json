So the following should both be valid:\r\n\r\n```js\r\na.then((foo) => {});\r\na.then(foo => {});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is not valid:\r\n\r\n```js\r\na.then(foo, bar => {});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\nThe rule _requires_ the parens to be omitted with a single argument.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnexpected parentheses around single function argument (arrow-parens)\r\n> 200 |     items.forEach((item) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\r\n\r\nYes, subject to the project desires. My recommendation is to change the `as-needed` rule to _allow_ omitting parens, as described, and add another option (name to be determined) that required omitting the parens for single-argument functions.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
