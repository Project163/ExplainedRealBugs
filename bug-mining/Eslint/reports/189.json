The TSC decided that ESLint 6 will drop support for Node 6, with the precise Node version support TBD.\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11022, it seemed like the consensus was that we should pick Node version requirements based on specific features we might want to use in ESLint, rather than just picking the latest Node versions as we did for v5.x. (However, not a lot of team members have chimed in on https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11022 -- feel free to add to that discussion, particularly if you disagree with that general approach.) I've mostly gone with that approach, although I've also taken into consideration which Node versions users will typically be upgrading to.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe currently support everything above Node 8.10.0 on the Node 8 release line. I don't think we should tighten that requirement, since AWS Lambda only supports Node 8.10.0. We've received a few requests to loosen that requirement with ESLint 5, but I'd rather not do that either since it could be nice to have features like `Module.builtinModules` and correct `require.resolve` behavior with the `paths` argument, both of which were introduced in Node 8.10.0.\r\n\r\nI think we should drop support for Node 9, since it's been at EOL for almost a year. \r\n\r\nWe currently support all versions of Node 10. There aren't any features we specifically need in Node 10 aside from the ones that in Node 8, so I'd recommend starting at the first Node 10 LTS release (i.e. `^10.13.0`) since this is probably where most users start using Node 10.\r\n\r\nNode 11 is going to be EOL in June, so I don't think too many users will be stuck on old versions of it. As a result, I'd arbitrarily suggest picking the latest version as of now, i.e. 11.10.1.\r\n\r\nSo I think our Node version support for ESLint 6 should be:\r\n\r\n`^8.10.0 || ^10.13.0 || >=11.10.1`","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
