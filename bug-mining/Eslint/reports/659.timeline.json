can reproduce the EMFILE error, but I don't see the call stack error. It's strange because we do have a [test for this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/b8270299abe777bb80a065d537aa1d4be74be705/tools/check-emfile-handling.js) that is running in CI, so I'm not sure why we're not getting failures there.\n\nI tinkered around with the retry package but couldn't find an easy solution.

reported that some users were still getting EMFILE errors even with using Retry. \r\n\r\nThe primary problem is that `#processQueue` was being called recursively, and when a lot of retries were necessary, this caused a stack overflow error.\r\n\r\nThere was another problem where a failed task was pushed to the front of the queue, allowing it to fail repeatedly while other tasks in the queue sat without being evaluated. Those tasks would then end up timing out and throwing the EMFILE error that they held.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both issues:\r\n\r\n1. Ensures that `#processQueue` is always called either with `setTimeout()` or in a promise resolver\r\n2. Failed tasks are pushed to the back of the queue to wait for another turn rather than the front.\r\n\r\nI also added a test for fails for long retries prior to this fix. This will now be run as part of CI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRefs
