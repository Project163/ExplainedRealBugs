Writing a custom rule and a core rule is basically the same. The page also includes some conventions we're using in core rules. I'm not sure where in the new hierarchy this page should be, and what its title should be, as it is of interest to both Extenders and Community Contributors.\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/97#discussion_r1017440912:\r\n\r\n1. keep the majority of the rule creation content on the \"Custom Rules\" page in the Extender documentation section. remove content about creating core rules. note somewhere on this page that if you want to create a core rule, refer to the Core Rules documentation (expanded on in next point).\r\n1. create a new \"Core Rules\" page in the Contributor documentation section. extract all content specifically about creating core rules into this page. This page should, as Nicholas proposed, point to the \"Custom Rules\" page for most of the rule creation documentation.\r\n1. do this work as a fast follow to the initial IA migration. while there could certainly be some confusion about how to work on custom rules between the initial migration and the completion of this work, i don't think it'd be a significant issue for the following reasons:\r\n  - i don't think many people are working on core rules at a given moment\r\n  - those people can probably figure out what they need to from the custom rules documentation.\r\n  - if those people run into any issues, they can ask in the Discord, and we can point them in the right direction.\r\n  - the amount of time when this is a potential issue would be pretty short, especially if we prioritize the reviews on the content splitting the pages, so that the changes get moved promptly.\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
