Non-recommended rules are explicitly set to \"off\", while recommended rules are set to \"error\".\r\n\r\nThis impacts users who might wish to extend eslint:recommended after having already extended a different configuration. The rules configured as \"off\" will override any rules configured as \"warn\" or \"error\" in the extended configuration.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this is pretty rare. However, it also seems that eslint:recommended should not explicitly turn off other rules.\r\n\r\nInspired by #10816.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nRemove the \"off\" rules from eslint:recommended. This is technically a breaking change, so we should do this within a major release.","closed_by":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10873/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
