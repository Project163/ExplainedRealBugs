(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nNew options to the rule schema\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n\r\n`import { Foo, Bar } from '../../my/relative-module'`\r\n`import { Foo } from '../../../my/relative-module'`\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nIt's not currently possible to ban importing _only_ a named import from a `pattern` ban. Nor is it possible to include a message for those bans.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\nCould be configured as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'no-restricted-imports: [\r\n  'error',\r\n  {\r\n    patterns: [ '**/my/relative-module'],\r\n    importNames: ['Foo'], // currently not supported for patterns\r\n    message: 'Don't import Foo from my/relative-module.
