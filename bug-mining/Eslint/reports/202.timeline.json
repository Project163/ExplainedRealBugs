is the purpose of this pull request? (put an \"X\" next to item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Changes an existing rule\r\n[X] Add something to the core\r\n\r\n- fixes #11370 \r\n- fixes #11405\r\n\r\n**What changes did you make? (Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `no-redeclare` rule stricter.\r\n\r\n- Implements https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/17\r\n- Adds `/*globals*/` comment check to `no-redeclare` rule. (#11370)\r\n- Enables `{ builtinGlobals: true }` option by default. (#11405)\r\n- ~~Adds some items to the migration guide.~~ (moved to #11515)\r\n\r\nAnd some chore:\r\n\r\n- Removes the accesses to `parserOptions` from `no-redeclare` rule. The `parserOptions` is not safe because each parser has different options.\r\n- Moves a utility that determines the location of a variable name in `/*globals*/` comments to `ast-utils` because it's shared with `no-unused-vars` rule and `no-redeclare` rule.\r\n- Adds several tests for lexical bindings into `no-redeclare` rule along with a loose parser that doesn't throw syntax errors on redeclaration of lexical bindings.\r\n- ~~Makes `eslint-plugin/test-case-property-ordering` rule's option more reasonable.~~ (moved to #11511)\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n- Should `no-redeclare` rule handle lexical bindings still? Since acorn 5.0.0, it throws syntax errors by such a redeclaration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2256605301,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjI1NjYwNTMwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2256605301","actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-05T18:29:42Z","label":{"name":"needs
