ESLint version\n\n8.49.0\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nThe following rules have been added in ESLint v8:\r\n\r\n* `logical-assignment-operators`\r\n* `no-constant-binary-expression`\r\n* `no-empty-static-block`\r\n* `no-new-native-nonconstructor`\r\n* `no-object-constructor`\r\n* `no-unused-private-class-members`\r\n* `prefer-object-has-own`\r\n\r\n\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nI'd propose that in v9.0.0 we add the following rules to `eslint:recommended`:\r\n\r\n* `no-constant-binary-expression` - reports possible errors\r\n* `no-empty-static-block` - similar to `no-empty`, which is already in `eslint:recommended`\r\n* `no-unused-private-class-members` - reports possible errors\r\n\r\nNote: we have a separate issue for `no-new-native-nonconstructor` (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17446)\r\n\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nDid I miss some rules we added in v8?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17596/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
