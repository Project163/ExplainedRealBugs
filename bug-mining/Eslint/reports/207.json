This means that the `overrides` in a shareable config priors to the setting in your `.eslintrc` file.\r\n> \r\n> ```yml\r\n> extends:\r\n>     - foo\r\n> rules:\r\n>     eqeqeq: error # silently ignored if the \"foo\" has the \"eqeqeq\" setting in \"overrides\".\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> After this proposal, the setting in your `.eslintrc` file priors to the setting in shareable configs always.
