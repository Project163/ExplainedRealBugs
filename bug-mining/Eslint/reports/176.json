At that point, we didn't know what options people wanted and the number of rules was very small. It seems like the current questions don't make sense for how ESLint is used today. For example, forcing people to pick a style guide doesn't make sense for everyone and sends a message that ESLint is used primarily for styling. I'd like to update the behavior of `--init` to better reflect current users expectations and usage.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\nThese are the ways I'd like to change `--init`:\r\n\r\n1. **Assume `ecmaVersion` is 2018.** We first asked which version of ECMAScript they were using when ES6 was just being implemented. At this point, I think it's fair to assume people always want the latest (they can change it in their config if not).\r\n2. **Ask how people want to use ESLint.** Instead of asking if users want to configure a style guide, ask \"How do you want to use ESLint?\", with the following options :\r\n  * To check syntax only\r\n  * To check syntax and find problems\r\n  * To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style\r\n3. **Ask for framework question to replace JSX/React question.** Instead of asking if people are using JSX and then if they are using React, I'd create one question that asks if they are using either React (which implies JSX) or Vue (because there's a helpful plugin for Vue and it's pretty popular now). \r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n\r\n* **Remove autoconfig option.** I'm not sure how people feel about this, but I'm skeptical that this option is used all that much thanks to the popularity of shareable configs. I'm in favor of removing it if others agree but have no problem leaving it in if people feel it's still helpful. \r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
