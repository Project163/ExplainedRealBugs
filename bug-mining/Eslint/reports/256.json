Default parameter values allow callers to specify as many or as few arguments as they want while getting the same functionality and minimizing boilerplate, wrapper code.\r\n\r\nBut all function parameters with default values should be declared after the function parameters without default values. Otherwise, it makes it impossible for callers to take advantage of defaults; they must re-specify the defaulted values or pass undefined in order to \"get to\" the non-default parameters.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\nyes.","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11361/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
