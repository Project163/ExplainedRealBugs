(This was an oversight from when the properties were added in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/commit/f5a7e4239071c5b56d2e476bced5c763b7e01c8d#diff-885d4b90cffa47361b72fc3c446d912a.)\r\n* The example formatters have patterns like this:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    module.exports = function(results) {\r\n        var results = results || [];\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    However, the results array should never be null, so there is no need to redeclare the variable with a default like that.\r\n* Several of the example formatters use `console.log` to output results, which is not recommended (since it doesn't work when the formatter is used by an integration). Instead, formatters should return a string.\r\n* The example [here](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-custom-formatters#using-a-json-formatter-first) for \"Using a JSON formatter first\" is unnecessarily complicated -- I don't think we need to walk people through how to create a separate script that reads from stdin. Also, we can tell people to use the built-in `json` formatter rather than creating their own custom formatter that does the same thing.","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9950/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
