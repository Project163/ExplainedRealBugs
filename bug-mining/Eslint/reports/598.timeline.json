That is why I went ahead and said you eslint should dereference the configuration e.g. `config = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(config)); // do whatever you want with config from here on`\r\n\r\nMy no-plugins example is coerced and doesn't make sense. I don't know why would you want to share the same options to two rules. BUT, now that I have shown you that the behavior is not related to plugins, but to eslint itself, the pattern of sharing configs \"upstream\" to the babel or typescript plugin is useful because many of their rules are supersets of the built-in ones and it allows you maintain the same configuration.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nReal life scenario: babel has a `babel/camelcase` rule, and typescript has a `typescript/camelcase` one, both supersets of the built-in `camelcase` rule. And the recommendation goes like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  camelcase: 'off', // turn off the built-in rule\r\n  'babel/camelcase': ['error', {ignoreDestructuring: true}] // activate the superset rule\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut if you maintain a `.eslintrc.basic.js` and a `.eslintrc.babel.js` meant just for your babel projects, then you need to\r\n\r\n* either sync the configuration (i.e. if you want `warn` instead of `error`, then make sure to remember to change it in both files)\r\n* or change `.eslintrc.babel.js` to smth like `let basic = require('./eslintrc.basic'); modules.exports = {rules: {camelcase: 'off', 'babel/camelcase':
