This rule already exists as an ESLint [internal rule](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/tools/internal-rules/no-useless-catch.js). Instead of just an internal rule, this should be a core rule.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[ ] Warns about a potential error (problem)\r\n[X] Suggests an alternate way of doing something (suggestion)\r\n[ ] Enforces code style (layout)\r\n[ ] Other (please specify:)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n/* warn about useless try/catch statement */\r\ntry {\r\n  throw new Error('whoops');\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n  throw e;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* only warn about catch clause */\r\ntry {\r\n  throw new Error('whoops');\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n  throw e;\r\n} finally {\r\n  console.log('done');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there is no semantic difference between\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntry {\r\n  throw new Error('whoops');\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n  throw e;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```js\r\nthrow new Error('whoops');\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of that, I can't think of a good reason why you would ever want a useless catch clause in any javascript codebase, seeing as how it just adds unnecessary clutter and complexity to your source code. It seems ESLint devs themselves agree since it exists as an internal rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this rule?**\r\n\r\nIf it is something that people want as a core rule, then sure.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11174/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
