That's reasonable, but following the same logic the original example can be replaced with const { SpecificParser } = parsers ? \r\n\r\nProbably (I've not tried, but I don't think the transpiling would change it enough to cause that not to work), but it would mean I'd have to rename if I was already importing that specific parser.\r\n\r\n> Also, this behavior wouldn't match \"an import that can be merged with another is a duplicate of that other\".\r\n\r\nActually I think you could argue it does, because those imports can be merged by renaming them to share the same name.\r\n\r\nI think what you're after here is a heuristic for what \"can be merged\" means, which I'd say is:\r\n\r\n> An import is considered mergable with another if the act of merging does not require the creation of extra nodes.\r\n\r\nThen, with that defined, this rule takes on the heuristic for its responsibility to be:\r\n\r\n> An import that can be merged with another import is a duplicate of that other.\r\n\r\nSo, in applying this we get:\r\n```\r\n// mergable, as parsers1 & parsers2 hold the same reference, and so their identifiers can be replaced.\r\nimport * as parsers1 from 'parsers';\r\nimport * as parsers2 from 'parsers';\r\n\r\n// mergable, as they can be combined without changing behaviour & remaining syntactically valid.\r\nimport defaultValue from 'parsers';\r\nimport { anotherValue } from 'parsers';\r\n\r\n// mergable as they will both trigger any side effects the module has.\r\nimport * as parsers2 from 'parsers';\r\nimport from 'parsers';\r\n\r\n// not mergable, as they would require new nodes to be created.\r\nimport { anotherValue } from 'parsers';\r\nimport * as parsers1 from 'parsers';\r\n```\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n*Personally*, I also think that it's a good thing to encourage not duplicating such imports, as (based on my understanding on the specification for modules) there is completely no reason to do so - it's effectively the namespace form of `no-useless-rename`.\r\n\r\nOverall, I totally agree that this is an interesting question, but I don't think it's big enough to be worth the bikeshed given it's very easy to implement an option for later 🙂\r\n\r\nI do think that the fixer for merging the last case should be a suggestion, since it will cause other to be invalid.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/572847786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"G-Rath","id":3151613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTE2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Rath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"G-Rath","id":3151613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTE2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3151613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Rath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Rath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-10T20:59:49Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T20:59:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12767","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12767/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12767/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12767/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/12767","id":547844937,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzYxMjU4NzM4","number":12767,"title":"Fix:

(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, `no-duplicate-imports` will ignore `export * from \"mod\"`, since it isn't possible to merge these exports with any other imports/exports. \r\n\r\nI believe it's actually even impossible to rewrite such code in any other way, so it seems that taking into account these declarations was a bug.\r\n\r\nAlso, documentation was missing the explanation for the `includeExports`  option. There was just a special case with both `import` and `export` declarations.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nYes. Ignoring `export * from` will also ignore duplicates:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport * from \"mod\";\r\nexport * from \"mod\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks like a possible error in exporting rather than a stylistic issue in importing (which is what this rule is about?). So, this indeed might not belong here, but after this fix there will be no rule to report
