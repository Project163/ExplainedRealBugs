So this looks like a bug, we should be linting anything passed on the command line. We should fix that.\r\n\r\nBut it seems like that's not the case, from this test suite: https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/22046939a7f250e6cce40a2acdfd3581a2ce29f5/tests/lib/cli-engine.js#L355-L375\r\n\r\nThe documentation doesn't seem very helpful. Searching for \"dot files\" doesn't help me, and [the section on `.eslintignore`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#eslintignore) only mentions:\r\n\r\n> Lines preceded by ! are negated patterns that re-include a pattern that was ignored by an earlier pattern.\r\n\r\nEven though I'm not ignoring anything. It's also weird that the message says `File ignored because of a matching ignore pattern` because I don't have a `.eslintignore` file in my project.\r\n\r\nThe weird part is that `yarn eslint client/.storybook/` works. Can we get some clarification on this issue (and the expected behavior) in the docs and/or in the CLI?\r\n\r\nIssues that I've already looked at:\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/5623\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10341\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/4828\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/tsc-meetings/blob/430455a12366c4614f322734b38521ef12870251/notes/2018/2018-08-02.md#do-not-ignore-files-started-with--by-default\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10597","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
