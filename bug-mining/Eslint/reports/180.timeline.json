(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis commit turns on our existing fuzzer tool to run a small number of iterations when the user runs `npm test`. This is intended to prevent bugs like https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11402 where a rule completely breaks when it encounters a particular syntax, but the author doesn't think to test for that kind of syntax.\r\n\r\nWhen there are no fuzzing errors, this adds about 5 seconds to the `npm test` time. (When there are fuzzing errors, it takes more time because the fuzzer does extra work to try to find the minimal config that reproduces the bug.)\r\n\r\nThe fuzzer actually has two modes: \"crash\" (where it only tries to detect rule crashes), and \"autofix\" (where it additionally tries to detect cases where a rule's autofixer creates a syntax error). For now, this PR just enables \"crash\" mode when running `npm test`, because I remember \"autofix\" mode had some false positives (although they might have been fixed due to parser upgrades).\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nThe tests will fail on this PR until https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/11403 is merged, because the fuzzer successfully detects the bug reported in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11402.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ankon","id":1210641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTA2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1210641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon","html_url":"https://github.com/ankon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-16T06:32:50Z","updated_at":"2019-02-16T06:32:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Collaborne/kubernetes-aws-resource-service/issues/48","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Collaborne/kubernetes-aws-resource-service","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Collaborne/kubernetes-aws-resource-service/issues/48/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Collaborne/kubernetes-aws-resource-service/issues/48/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Collaborne/kubernetes-aws-resource-service/issues/48/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Collaborne/kubernetes-aws-resource-service/issues/48","id":410993077,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTA5OTMwNzc=","number":48,"title":"An
