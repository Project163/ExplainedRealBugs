for the feedback everyone. We can definitely take a look at how to reduce the download size. \n\nThe reason we didn't start with a separate package is because we weren't quite sure what parts of the `eslint` package we'd need to make the MCP server work. Keeping it all together meant we could iterate quickly and not have to worry about updating external-facing APIs as needed.\n\nWith what we know so far, it seems like spinning off into a separate package is possible and makes sense. We won't be rolling back this most recent release as we do need to get feedback on actually using the MCP server to be sure any plans going forward make sense.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2851126470/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17520251509,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAKjKDc61CALEzwAAAAQUSdJ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/17520251509","actor":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-05T14:06:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2851127467","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19682#issuecomment-2851127467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19682","id":2851127467,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc6p8MCr","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-05T14:06:29Z","updated_at":"2025-05-05T14:06:29Z","body":"Ping

Then the new `--mcp` option could still live in the eslint CLI (at least during this phase of development) but could display a nice error and exit if its dependencies are missing.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/2851429371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joshkel","id":476338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjMzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/476338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel","html_url":"https://github.com/joshkel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshkel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
