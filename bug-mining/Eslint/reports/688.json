As per types, `files` are accepting a nested array of strings:\n\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/cb69ab374c149eb725b2fc5a8f0ff33fd7268a46/lib/types/index.d.ts#L1260\n\nAnd without any doubt I assumed the files array will be flattened into `string[]` and thus the reason for such a type is developer convenience.\n\nBut I proved to be wrong. If another array of strings is passed to the top level array, only files matched **all** the patterns from that array will be matched, i.e. intersection operation is taking place.\n\nHere is a small repo demonstrating that behavior: https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-ujdzec\nRun `pnpm test` to lint. I've left a note in the eslint config file what should be changed to confirm this behavior.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nI would like to see this documented in the main documentation on the site and ideally in JSDoc for `files` property. Sorry if I've missed it.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"fasttime","id":6367844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjc4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6367844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime","html_url":"https://github.com/fasttime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fasttime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/18966/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
