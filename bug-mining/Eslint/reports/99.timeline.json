this bug is tougher than the first glance. Looks to be by some factors which contain breaking change to fix.\r\n\r\n1. `no-use-before-define` rule doesn't check `for` scope entirely.\r\n2. `Linter#getScope()` returns a certain wrong scope if the current node is any of `ForStatement`, `ForInStatement`, and `ForOfStatement`. It should return the scopes which their type is `for`, but it returned the parent scope of the `for` scope. We should fix the `Linter#getScope()` method, but it has big impact, maybe. Fortunately, we are making new major version currently.\r\n3. `eslint-scope` package doesn't seem to handle `ForInStatement`/`ForOfStatement` correctly. `Reference` objects of `ForInStatement#right`/`ForOfStatement#right` are missing. It has been stolen by enigmatic TDZ scope.\r\n\r\nSo it needs the following steps to fix this bug:\r\n\r\n1. Fix `eslint-scope` to remove TDZ scope such as I mentioned in https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/pull/33#issuecomment-343646474. This is a breaking change.\r\n2. Fix `Linter#getScope()` to return `for` scope for  `ForStatement`, `ForInStatement`, and `ForOfStatement`. This may be a breaking change.\r\n3.

The TDZ scope steals reference objects in `ForInStatement#right` then it has caused bugs. TDZ is the word about a timing matter rather than a structure matter, so it's wrong that `eslint-scope` makes TDZ scopes. Actually, all our core rules just ignore the TDZ scopes.\r\n\r\nWe should remove the TDZ scopes.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that we should take the removal of TDZ scopes as a breaking change because the TDZ scope has existed in our variable analysis while over 3 years ago.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10245/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-21T07:05:32Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T07:05:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10246","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10246/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10246/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10246/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10246","id":316468726,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTY0Njg3MjY=","number":10246,"title":"context.getScope()

I'm sorry that I don't follow issue templates.\r\n\r\nFrom #10227.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\r\n    ;\r\nfor (const key in obj)\r\n    ;\r\nfor (const x of xs)\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose `for` loops (i.e. `ForStatement`, `ForInStatement`, and `ForOfStatement`) can define variable(s) in the itself scope. So `eslint-scope` makes `for` scope for those.\r\n\r\nBut, `context.getScope()`s in the following example don't return correct `for` scopes. Those return the parent scope of the correct `for` scopes. As a result, `context.getScope().variables` doesn't include iteration variables.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexports.create = (context) => {\r\n    return {\r\n        ForStatement() {\r\n            context.getScope()\r\n        },\r\n        ForInStatement() {\r\n            context.getScope()\r\n        },\r\n        ForOfStatement() {\r\n            context.getScope()\r\n        },\r\n

this behavior has existed since ESLint borned.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10246/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-21T07:16:36Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T07:16:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10247","id":316469358,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTY0NjkzNTg=","number":10247,"title":"context.getScope()
