Not even on ESLint-specific comments - just on random comments throughout their codebase.\r\n\r\nI did a quick check of the FB codebase and found _**200**_ comments which need to be updated.\r\nMany of them are \"multiline singleline\" comments:\r\n```js\r\n// this is the start of my comment which uses the word\r\n// global on the second line\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the fix to change `s/global/Global/` isn't great as it would inject a capital into the middle of the comment.\r\nThis breaking change will require time and effort to find, investigate and codemod.\r\nThis is likely going to encourage people to not bother with the upgrade in the interim.\r\n\r\n# Assumes users read the docs\r\n\r\nMost users will not read the ESLint docs. Especially at any medium-to-large company where linting is managed by someone else - the majority of users will be just consumers of an existing linting environment.\r\nThey won't know what the heck `Failed to parse JSON from ' comment that's not actually an eslint comment': Unexpected token c in JSON at position 2` means, nor will they want to go and read ESLint's v8 release notes to figure it out.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a user that sees all of those `no-unused-vars` errors isn't going to immediately click as to their meaning. Given today's codebases - those users have likely never seen a `/* global */` comment as globals (if any) were configured via the `.eslintrc`.\r\n\r\nI myself only understood why it errored not because I pattern-matched it as a globals comment I've seen before - but because I remembered the globals augmentation from when I reimplemented the `no-unused-vars` rule.\r\n\r\n# Poor messaging\r\n\r\nThis is very closely related to the last point.\r\n\r\n\"Failed to parse JSON\" is a super cryptic error message to see. It means absolutely nothing to a user: \"I just wrote a random comment, why is there now a JSON parse error on that comment???\"\r\n\r\nI encountered it here in typescript-eslint: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/a752638f975935882746ee5ef614ca02f120675d/.eslintrc.js#L80-L82\r\n`// eslint base` produced the error `Failed to parse JSON from ' base': Unexpected token 'b' in JSON at position 2`\r\n\r\nEither this should produce no errors at all - or it should catch the error and explain the actual problem.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the \"global\" handling is **incredibly cryptic**.\r\n```js\r\n// this is the start of my comment which uses the word\r\n// global on the second line\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis innocent comment should not result in 4 `no-unused-vars` errors. Or if it does - it should clearly explain what the problem is and how to fix it.\r\nI could also easily see cryptic behaviour if the comment contains actual globals defined elsewhere in it as well, eg:\r\n```ts\r\n// this is the start of my comment which uses the word\r\n// global it describes a test written using jest\r\n\r\njest.spyOn(...);\r\nit('', () => {\r\n  describe('', () => {\r\n    test('', () => {});\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\n////\r\n//  3:14  error  'has' is defined but never used      no-unused-vars\r\n//  3:18  error  'a' is defined but never used        no-unused-vars\r\n//  3:25  error  'written' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\r\n//  3:33  error  'using' is defined but never used    no-unused-vars\r\n// BUT it, test and jest do not get reported - what?\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSorry if the wording is a bit harsh above. I tried to boil it down to the facts. I am just easily frustrated by easily avoidable poor UX, and this is exactly that - a tiny devx win for a huge UX loss.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/903193470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradzacher","id":7462525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjI1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7462525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher","html_url":"https://github.com/bradzacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradzacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/903487155","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14960#issuecomment-903487155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14960","id":903487155,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc412h6z","user":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T06:42:09Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T06:42:09Z","body":"the

seems I was too late.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if `eslint-*` directives could be supported, at least.\r\n\r\nWill the RFC be reopened for further discussion?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/907451512/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"glen-84","id":261509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/261509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84","html_url":"https://github.com/glen-84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glen-84/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/907470103","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/14960#issuecomment-907470103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/14960","id":907470103,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc42FuUX","user":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T20:53:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T20:53:25Z","body":"Reverted
