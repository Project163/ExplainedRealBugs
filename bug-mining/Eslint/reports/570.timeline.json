issue describes the implementation plan for eslint/rfcs#9, which will take place in several phases:\n\n## Phase 1: Extract current config system\n\n- [x] Create new GitHub repository (`eslint/eslintrc`)\n- [x] Copy`eslintrc` source files and tests into new GitHub repository\n- [x] Create Jenkins release job for `@eslint/eslintrc`\n- [x] Publish `@eslint/eslintrc` to npm\n- [x] Update ESLint to use `@eslint/eslintrc`\n- [x] Remove in-memory filesystem from tests\n- [x] Update `CLIEngine` to use `CascadingConfigArrayFactory` from `@eslint/eslintrc`\n\n## Phase 2: Implement flat config with `eslintrc` compatibility\n\n- [x] Create the `FlatCompat` class in `eslint/eslintrc` repository\n- [x] Create `FlatConfigArray` to represent simple configs\n- [x] Update `Linter` class to understand `FlatConfigArray` objects\n- [x] Ensure `Linter#defineRule` and `Linter#definePlugin` throw errors when using `FlatConfigArray`\n- [x] Add `context.languageOptions` in backwards-compatible way to `context` in `Linter`\n- [x] Ensure `context.parserPath` still works in `Linter` for `FlatConfigArray` (for now)\n- [x] Create `FlatRuleTester` to allow rule testing with `FlatConfigArray` format\n- [x] Create `FlatESLint` class to mirror `ESLint` class but use `eslint.config.js` instead\n- [x] #15661\n- [x] #15683\n- [x] #15687\n- [x] Implement caching\n- [x] Update `cli.js` to search for `eslint.config.js` file and use `FlatESLint` if found (`ESLint` if not)\n- [x] Ensure invalid CLI flags cause errors when using flat config (for example, `--resolve-plugins-relative-to`)\n- [x] Switch `eslint/eslint` repo to use flat config\n- [x] Document flat config\n- [x] Release ESLint with `eslintrc` compatibility\n- [x] #16416\n- [x] #16415\n- [x] #16414 \n- [x] #16413 \n- [x] #16410 \n- [x] #16402 \n- [x] #16341 \n- [x] #16340 \n- [x] #16299 \n- [x] #16275 \n- [x] #16265 \n- [x] #16264\n- [x] #16537\n- [x] #16875\n\n## Phase 3: Compatibility testing\n\n- [ ] Work with `typescript-eslint` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/6836))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-import` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2829 https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2873\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-config-airbnb` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic)\n- [x] Work with `eslint-config-standard` to switch to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard/pull/277)]\n- [x] Work with `eslint-plugin-n` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n/pull/95))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-vue` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly ([pull request](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/pull/2226))\n- [ ] Work with `eslint-plugin-react` to switch configs to new format and ensure it works correctly (@mdjermanovic) ([pull request](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/pull/3600))\n- [x] Switch ESLint config to load external configs/plugins without `FlatCompat`\n- [x] Release ESLint with extended compatibility\n\n## Phase 4: General availability (v9.0.0)\n\n- [x] Write blog post about flat config format\n- [x] Output warning when people use `eslintrc` files\n- [x] Switch documentation so `eslint.config.js` is the default and recommended format (link to legacy `eslintrc` docs from the same page)\n- [x] Switch `Linter` to use flat config by default\n- [x] Switch documentation for shareable configs to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] Switch documentation for plugins to flat config format (links to legacy docs included)\n- [x] #14308\n- [x] Rename `ESLint` class to `LegacyESLint` and rename `FlatESLint` to `ESLint`\n- [x] Delete `RuleTester` class and rename `FlatRuleTester` to `RuleTester`\n- [x] Update `api.js` to export new values for `ESLint` and `RuleTester`\n- [x] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to return `true` except if `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG` is `false`.\n- [x] Release ESLint with GA flat config\n\n## Phase 5: Remove `eslintrc` (v10.0.0)\n\n- [ ] Remove old CLI flags\n- [ ] Remove `context.parserPath`, `context.parserOptions`, `context.globals` in `Linter` (#20086, eslint/rewrite#263)\n- [ ] Remove `configType` constructor option for `Linter`; throw error if found.\n- [ ] Report an error when `eslint-env` config comment is used (#20128)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` support (#20037)\n- [ ] Remove `eslintrc` documentation\n- [ ] Delete `FlatESLint` class\n- [ ] Delete `LegacyESLint` class\n- [ ] Switch `shouldUseFlatConfig()` to always return `true` \n- [ ] Release ESLint without `eslintrc`

all pros and cons, I think the best option is 2.\r\n\r\n> * Introducing function configs complicates sharing configs. Whereas right now we can assume that a shared config is either an object (you can use with the spread operator) or an array of objects (you can use `map()` to apply to different `files` and `ignores`), function configs hide their internals, and because they expect that `context` object, will be hard to manipulate and customize.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a shared config will document what it exports (an object, array, or function), if it's a function, config file that uses the shared config can call it with the `context` object and then customize the return value the same as it would customize an exported object/array?

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nRelocates the \"eslint:all\" and \"eslint:recommended\" configs into the `@eslint/js` package so they can be referenced from there instead of as strings. I needed to change the \"eslint:all\" file to be autogenerated at build time rather than from run time because it won't be able to reference the full rule list at run time. (The rules are outside of the package.)\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I had to do an initial publish of `@eslint/js`. I also added a Jenkins job to make releasing this package easy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever a file in the `lib/rules` directory is `lint-staged` will regenerate `eslint-all.js` so that we are automatically updating that configuration. We will still have to manually release `@eslint/js` in the short term if there are any changes.\r\n\r\nFixes #16537\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nI added a deprecation notice for using `\"eslint:recommended\"` and `\"eslint:all\"` as strings inside of flat config to let people know they should switch to `@eslint/js`. Because people are starting to use flat config, I don't think we want to break this usage. Currently, this results in deprecation notices even when using `FlatCompat` because we just [pass through the strings](https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/blob/f7d0f33b30b3839800df046df1f5139941cdbd1a/lib/flat-compat.js#L57-L65).\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to update `@eslint/eslintrc` to use `@eslint/js` directly as well? Or, should we force people to pass in their own reference to `@eslint/js` in the `FlatCompat` constructor?\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004 -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16844/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1417842250","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16537#issuecomment-1417842250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/16537","id":1417842250,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5Ugo5K","user":{"login":"CallMeLaNN","id":272218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/272218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN","html_url":"https://github.com/CallMeLaNN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CallMeLaNN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-05T13:28:15Z","updated_at":"2023-02-05T13:28:15Z","body":"Just want to share I was wondering why it does work with `eslint:recommended` but doesn't work with other plugin's configs as a new way to replace `.eslintrc` `extends`.\r\n\r\nGood to know that the special string and the example will be removed and updated to avoid this confusion:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport jsdoc from \"eslint-plugin-jsdoc\";\r\n\r\nexport default [\r\n  \"eslint:recommendded\",\r\n  jsdoc.configs.recommended, // Example from the doc but other plugins that internally using `extends` doesn't work.\r\n  \"plugin:other-plugin/recommended\", // So I tried this because the array seems to accept string like `extends` but I was wrong.\r\n  // It was an idea also to c&p from the old `extends` to here\r\n  {\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `FlatCompat` is really helpful in this case.
