Example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function failing() {\r\n  throw new Error('foo');\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync function noAwait() {\r\n  try {\r\n    return failing();\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    return 'oops';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nasync function withAwait() {\r\n  try {\r\n    return await failing();\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    return 'oops';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnoAwait().then(console.log, console.warn);\r\nwithAwait().then(console.log, console.warn);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will call `console.warn` with the 'foo' error, which is thrown from `noAwait`. But it will log `oops` from the `withAwait` function. This is confusing behaviour, which might completely catch people off guard. So no, the `await` after `return` is not always superfluous, and recommending it's removal might lead to subtle changes that was not expected.
