Please include the actual source code causing the issue, as well as the command that you used to run ESLint.**\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the source code below: -->\r\n```js\r\nvar x = [''];\r\nif (x)\r\n  for (var i in x) {\r\n    if (i > 0)\r\n      console.log(i);\r\n  }\r\nelse\r\n  console.log('whoops');\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the command you used to run ESLint: -->\r\n```bash\r\n./node_modules/.bin/eslint --fix index.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What did you expect to happen?**\r\nESLint should make no changes to the code, as the only curly braces present are required.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\nESLint changes the code to the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar x = [''];\r\nif (x)\r\n  for (var i in x) \r\n    if (i > 0)\r\n      console.log(i);\r\n  \r\nelse\r\n  console.log('whoops');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect -- the `else` is now associated with the inner `if` instead of the outer one. The execution behavior changes accordingly:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ node index.js \r\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint index.js\r\n\r\n/tmp/eslint-repro/index.js\r\n  3:3  warning  Unnecessary { after 'for-in'  curly\r\n\r\n✖ 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)\r\n  0 errors and 1 warning potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.\r\n\r\n$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --fix index.js \r\n$ node index.js \r\nwhoops\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did a little bit more experimentation: when I replace the `for` block with a `while` block, the same issue occurs. However, when I replace the `for` block with another `if`, ESLint correctly detects that the curly braces are mandatory.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug?**\r\nI can if necessary, although the fix is probably much faster for somebody who's already familiar with the relevant code.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
