for great work @not-an-aardvark.\r\nFrom description I didn't quit get, is it possible to use `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` option right in `.eslintrc` or we still need to use `eslint-plugin-eslint-comments` which will use that option internally?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/333236790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"klimashkin","id":576077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjA3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin","html_url":"https://github.com/klimashkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klimashkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1272366047,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI3MjM2NjA0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1272366047","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-29T20:54:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1272366050,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyNzIzNjYwNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1272366050","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-29T20:54:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/333240295","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9249#issuecomment-333240295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9249","id":333240295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzI0MDI5NQ==","user":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/ev

There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.\n\nI recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint.\nGiven that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\n---\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Release Notes</summary>\n<strong>v4.8.0</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/commit/3f2b9087584aef5eb12c7312289d774497f083fb\" class=\"commit-link\"><tt>3f2b908</tt></a> New: add option to report unused eslint-disable directives (fixes <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/issues/9249\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"255797799\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9249\">#9249</a>) (<a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/pull/9250\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"255798076\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9250\">#9250</a>) (Teddy Katz)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/commit/ff2be59e1ff1e8cab0a95844a502f612f2278c94\" class=\"commit-link\"><tt>ff2be59</tt></a> Fix: dot notation rule failing to catch string template (fixes <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/issues/9350\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"260356515\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9350\">#9350</a>) (<a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/pull/9357\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"260819097\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9357\">#9357</a>) (Phil Quinn)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/commit/b1372da90d00cb0858d1b0ae51df98e1758679ce\" class=\"commit-link\"><tt>b1372da</tt></a> Chore: remove sourceCode property from Linter (refs <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/issues/9161\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"253051999\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9161\">#9161</a>) (<a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/pull/9363\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"261107217\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9363\">#9363</a>) (Teddy Katz)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/commit/cef6f8cbd9eebc938512b5cd2d719e014c5cf1b9\" class=\"commit-link\"><tt>cef6f8c</tt></a> Docs: remove line about removing rules from semver policy (<a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/pull/9367\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"261176847\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9367\">#9367</a>) (Teddy Katz)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/commit/06efe87c65b4e1006c921596bb301d0986ea3403\" class=\"commit-link\"><tt>06efe87</tt></a> Fix: Add meta element with charset attribute.
