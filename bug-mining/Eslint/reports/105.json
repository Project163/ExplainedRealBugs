It's also very widely generic, and although it could replace `max-statements` in some uses, it checks a different metric. It also does *not* conflict with any other rules, and it's pretty much independent from everything short of the language itself.\r\n\r\nOther linters and style guides in various languages already do similar:\r\n\r\n- Rubocop has [`Metrics/MethodLength`](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cops_metrics/#metricsmethodlength) which does exactly what I propose here, including the proposed option.\r\n- Google's JS style guide ([by proxy](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Code_formatting#Code_formatting) of their [C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Write_Short_Functions)), recommends 40 lines or fewer per function.\r\n- [The Linux Kernel's style guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#functions) recommends 48 lines or fewer.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>This is the original bug I filed</summary>\r\n\r\nIt should basically allow a configurable limit of the max number of lines per function, much like how `max-statements` limits the number of statements. This has precedent: Google's JS style guide ([by proxy](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Code_formatting#Code_formatting) of their [C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Write_Short_Functions)), recommends 40 lines or fewer per function. Also, to draw another language's style guide, [the Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#functions) recommends 48 lines or fewer.\r\n</details>","closed_by":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9842/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
