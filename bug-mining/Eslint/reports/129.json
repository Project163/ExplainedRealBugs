For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/a{/.test(\"a{12}\")     //→ true\r\n/a{/u.test(\"a{12}\")    //→ Incomplete quantifier\r\n/a{1/.test(\"a{12}\")    //→ true\r\n/a{1/u.test(\"a{12}\")   //→ Incomplete quantifier\r\n/a{12/.test(\"a{12}\")   //→ true\r\n/a{12/u.test(\"a{12}\")  //→ Incomplete quantifier\r\n/a{12}/.test(\"a{12}\")  //→ false\r\n/a{12}/u.test(\"a{12}\") //→ false\r\n/\\x/.test(\"x\")         //→ true\r\n/\\x/u.test(\"x\")        //→ Invalid escape\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to `\"use strict\"`.\r\nThe `u` flag makes clearer syntax and helps to catch mistakes early.\r\n\r\n**What category of rule is this? (place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[X] Enforces code style\r\n[ ] Warns about a potential error\r\n[ ] Suggests an alternate way of doing something\r\n[ ] Other (please specify:)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n//✘ BAD\r\n/foo/\r\n\r\n//✓ GOOD\r\n/foo/u\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\n\r\nWe have `strict` rule for `\"use strict\"`.\r\nThis rule is similar to the `strict` rule, disabling legacy syntax to catch mistakes early.","closed_by":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9961/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9961/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
