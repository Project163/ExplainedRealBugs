(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nAs part of the docs IA update, changed the table of contents, page names, and section landing pages to reflect the updated information architecture.\r\n\r\nMisc other notes: \r\n\r\n- Added 'Working Groups' page to the TOC\r\n- kept 'Getting the Source Code' at the top of the 'Contribute to ESLint' TOC section. this page will go away as part of #16775\r\n- per https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/16756 convo, renamed 'Ignoring Code' -> 'Ignore Files'\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nThese issues should be completed following the work in this PR:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16648\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16761\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16762  the IA update RFC says the page /use/configure/plugins should be called \"Configure Plugins\", but made the name here \"Configure Plugins & Parsers\" b/c the page contains parser info as well. there should be separate pages for plugins and parsers b/c they're separate entities. right now keeping page name to have both \"Configure Plugins and Parsers\" b/c page contains both, but will split up pages and have separate \"Configure Plugins\" and \"Configure Parsers\" pages in PR for this issue.\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16763\r\n- https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/16764\r\n-
