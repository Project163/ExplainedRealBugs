Should we consider switching to webpack or other bundler?\r\n\r\nThis not only relates browserify only, but also other build tool. For example, we can use `babel-loader` or `rollup-plugin-babel` instead of `babelify`.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n1. Remove browserify from the build steps of ESLint.\r\n2. Add webpack or other bundler.\r\n3. Update the Karma config, and use some preprocessors if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nYes.","closed_by":{"login":"aladdin-add","id":13050025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDUwMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13050025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add","html_url":"https://github.com/aladdin-add","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aladdin-add/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11366/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
