Q: When do fixes conflict?\r\n    A: [\"Conflicting fixes are fixes that would be applied to the same part of a string. So if two fixes want to modify characters 0 through 5, only one will be applied.\"](https://github.com/eslint/website/issues/791#issuecomment-700233043)\r\n1. Q: If fixes conflict which one will be applied?\r\n    A: [Fixes are not guaranteed to be applied.](https://github.com/eslint/website/issues/791#issuecomment-700233043) ESLint may choose to apply or not to apply any fix.\r\n1. Q: Can the (rule) developer affect which one of the conflicting fixes is applied?\r\n    A: [No.](https://github.com/eslint/website/issues/791#issuecomment-700233043)\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\nNo. I'm not good at writing technical documentation.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13721/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
