(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\n5018378131fd5190bbccca902c0cf4276ee1581a changed the codebase to use unicode regexes almost everywhere, with the exception of places where regexes are constructed from user input. However, two issues occurred to cause a bug:\r\n\r\n* Due to an oversight, the regular expressions constructed in the `no-warning-comments` rule were changed to be unicode regexes even though those regexes were constructed from user input.\r\n* The `no-warning-comments` rule dynamically creates regexes with unnecessary escape characters, and unnecessary escape characters are invalid in unicode regexes.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the first issue. The second issue isn't a problem on its own, but it will need to be fixed in order to implement https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11423.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nNothing in
