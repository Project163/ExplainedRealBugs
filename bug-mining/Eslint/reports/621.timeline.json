In flat config, patterns should not start with `/` .\r\n\r\nThis is different from .gitignore, where `/a.js` pattern matches only top-level `a.js`, while `a.js` pattern matches `a.js` at any level. In flat config, `a.js` pattern matches only top-level `a.js`, `**/a.js` should be used to match at any level, while `/a.js` is basically invalid. We should document this as well.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1879794813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/1879821055","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17964#issuecomment-1879821055","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/17964","id":1879821055,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAKjKDc5wC8r_","user":{"login":"fisker","id":172584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjU4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker","html_url":"https://github.com/fisker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fisker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-06T20:32:47Z","updated_at":"2024-01-06T20:32:47Z","body":"```\r\ntests/format/**/*\r\n!tests/format/**/*/\r\n!tests/format/**/jsfmt.spec.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoesn't
