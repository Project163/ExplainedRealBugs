ESLint version\r\n\r\nv8.55.0\r\n\r\n### What problem do you want to solve?\r\n\r\nAfter migrating my repository from `.eslintrc.js` to flat config `eslint.config.js`, I was confused by some additional linting errors that showed up. I then realized these linting errors were in files that were supposed to be ignored by `.eslintignore`. After doing some digging through ESLint github issues/PRs, I found out `.eslintignore` no longer works with flat config.\r\n\r\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\r\n\r\n1. Document that `.eslintignore` no longer works in the migration guide: https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide\r\n2. Most importantly, add an error or warning when `.eslintignore` is detected with flat config, similar to how we often show a warning when the user provides an option that has been removed/deprecated.\r\n\r\nIf we don't have automated detection for this, then inevitably a large percentage of users performing this migration will meet this same confusion, and some will forget to cleanup/delete their old `.eslintignore` file. Having an `.eslintignore` present with flat config is a recipe for confusion. I can imagine some users even trying to keep `.eslintignore` and `ignores` in `eslint.config.js` in sync because they aren't sure which they are supposed to use.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we could throw an error to disallow this mistake entirely, especially since flat config isn't considered stable yet until ESLint v9. Otherwise, we can print a warning to the console. The error/warning message would describe the replacement for this file or link to documentation on it.\r\n\r\nConcerns:\r\n1. Is there any situation in which the user would need to ignore the presence of `.eslintignore`?\r\n\r\n### Participation\r\n\r\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nAre there any other old files we should warn about to ease the migration? Should we warn when both `.eslintrc.js` and `eslint.config.js` are present?\r\n\r\n### Related\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17822\r\n*
