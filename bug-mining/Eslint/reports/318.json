(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?** New option, default behavior unchanged\r\n\r\nSeveral options for the `indent` rule accept the string `\"off\"` to disable the check and let the user do it however they want. But a few of them do not, such as `\"outerIIFEBody\"`. I would like to be able to set `\"outerIIFEBody\"` to `\"off\"`. Currently I have to choose between 0 or 1 but both choices enforce something, and I don't want to enforce anything.\r\n\r\nAlso, I find it curious that several of the options support the `\"off\"` setting but only `\"outerIIFEBody\"` and a few others don't.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n// File 1\r\n(function() {\r\n    a();\r\n)();\r\n\r\n// File 2\r\n(function() {\r\nb();\r\n)();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?** One of the files will cause a warning, depending whether I choose 0 or 1 for the `\"outerIIFEBody\"` rule.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?** With the `\"off\"` option, eslint would not give a warning for any of those cases, while still checking the other indentation rules for the other options.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?** Sadly I don't have time for this at the moment...\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11377/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
