like #17656 introduced an unintended change in `no-warnings-comments.js` where before it roughly looked like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar configuration = context.options[0] || {};\r\nvar decoration = [...configuration.decoration || []].join(\"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards it looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [{ decoration, location, terms: warningTerms }] = context.options;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich unintentionally(?) removes the `context.options[0] || {}` default, which eg. causes `eslint-plugin-unicorn@<15.0.1` to fail (see https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/pull/2497)\r\n\r\nSince this happened in a minor `eslint` release but the fix for `eslint-plugin-unicorn` is only available as a patch to its latest major, this is causing me some issues.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that you won't be wanting to merge this though as `eslint-plugin-unicorn` is [extending that rule](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/8b7c5fcf5c9743db4afde0bb9c90cc51782d47ef/rules/utils/get-builtin-rule.js#L4) through:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrequire('eslint/use-at-your-own-risk').builtinRules.get('no-warning-comments')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd as discussed in #19013 you don't consider that a good practise:\r\n\r\n> It's in unstable APIs because rule APIs are indeed not stable\r\n\r\n> Core rules are not intended to extended any you do so at your own risk\r\n\r\nPerhaps #19013 or similar can suggest an alternative for eg. `eslint-plugin-unicorn` to avoid this happening again in the future, but my guess is you consider such suggestions to be out of scope of `eslint` and as such to not be something you ant to get involved in.\r\n\r\nHere's a PR fixing the regression at least, you decide if you want to accept it or reject it 🤷‍♂️\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Thank you for contributing!\r\n\r\n    ESLint adheres to the

off the top of my head, maybe the place to put this warning is on this page?\nhttps://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/custom-rules\n\nSo if someone is thinking they'll extend an existing rule and go that page looking for help, the warning will be there?\n\n> We should note that the recommendation isn't as simple as \"just don't do it!\". \n\nYes it is. :smile: We've said this over and over again: rules are *not* part of the public API and should not be loaded at runtime by anything other than ESLint itself. They can change, be removed, etc. at any point in time. When you do so, you're voiding your warranty and anything goes. The only [reason we have `builtinRules`](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/blob/main/designs/2021-package-exports/README.md#remaining-public-api) is because too many existing plugins would break immediately. (Note: they *will* all break when we eventually move all rules out of the core.)\n\nIf we're going to document anything, it needs to be stated in the strongest possible terms: DO NOT DO THIS. The only acceptable way to extend a core rule is to copy the file into your own project and then wrap it however you want. That does put more maintenance burden on plugin developers, but that's the point. If you want to do something that isn't officially supported, you need to take full responsibility for that implementation. \n\nAs an aside: We have releases every two weeks, so you could just set a job to run every two weeks to sync things up. Nothing will change any more rapidly than that.\n\nFurther discussions around

ESLint version\n\n9.15.0\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nForking out of #19134 & https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/10338 -> https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19169#issuecomment-2499150529:\n\n> The only acceptable way to extend a core rule is to copy the file into your own project and then wrap it however you want. That does put more maintenance burden on plugin developers, but that's the point. If you want to do something that isn't officially supported, you need to take full responsibility for that implementation.\n\nThis is not an ideal situation for plugin developers. The required extra work in lieu of having a pluggable API or abstractions necessitates that plugin developers:\n\n- Maintain automations to keep up with ESLint's releases - including copying rules and any imported dependencies from ESLint core & its package dependencies\n  - Amusingly, this again leads plugins to rely on implementation details. Just, now that would only be during their build steps, not their published packages\n- Be deeply familiar with and having a dependency on the potentially any/all implementation details of base rules\n\nMuch of that work is already in play today, including taking the dependency on base rules. Both the current unsupported approach _and_ the recommended _\"copy and wrap\"_ approach cause higher-than-expected levels of implementation detail reliance in extensions.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nI honestly have no good idea. If the goal of ESLint is to not allow plugins to rely on _any_ behavior from rules -which is my interpretation of https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/80#discussion_r629623105 - then generalizing any of the following strategies we typically do in typescript-eslint seem moot.\n\nFor example, [`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/f5e23e28653705fc7021d8c780f0d63656dea518/packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/no-unused-expressions.ts) effectively wraps the base rule's `ExpressionStatement` with filtering logic. But if we can't rely on the base rule having any particular node selectors, then... 🤷\n\nIf the ESLint team has appetite to work with plugin developers on this, maybe it would be useful as a next step for someone to gather all the various extension rules and strategies they've taken? Just to see what the landscape & common strategies are?\n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nPersonally, I don't think resolving this issue should block #19169. The _\"don't do this\"_ urge with the current _\"copy and wrap\"_ recommended approach can be added regardless of this issue. I suspect finding a more preferable strategy (this issue) will take much longer. If and when an alternate strategy is resolved, it can always add it to the docs.\n\nI'll also note that plugins aren't \"choosing\" to write extension rules: they _have_ to to satisfy user need. For example, typescript-eslint's extension rules must act the same as their base rules _except_ for cases where TypeScript's syntax and/or type checking change something. I see extension rules as an expected use case for plugins that just hasn't yet had a formalized first-party ESLint API. If plugins could avoid taking any dependency on core rule behavior in this way -and therefore inconveniencing the ESLint project- that would be even better!\n\n---\n\nEdit (March 2025): The discussion is long enough that comments are being hidden by default.
