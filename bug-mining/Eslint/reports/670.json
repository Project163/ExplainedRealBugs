Only after reading https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/18439#issuecomment-2105500273, did I get the difference between frozen and deprecated rules.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nYou could describe with more detail what frozen rules like `typescript-eslint` do: `This rule is feature frozen: it will no longer receive new features such as new options. It still will accept bug and documentation fixes for its existing area of features.`\n\nSee https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/member-ordering/#:~:text=This%20rule%20is%20feature%20frozen%3A%20it%20will%20no%20longer%20receive%20new%20features%20such%20as%20new%20options.%20It%20still%20will%20accept%20bug%20and%20documentation%20fixes%20for%20its%20existing%20area%20of%20features.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19346/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/19346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
