(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\nI think it should be an option, something like `onlyForVariableDeclation` of type `{boolean}`. When true, `no-multi-assign` will only trigger when multi-assign occurs when a variable is being declared. That said. I don't have a firm grasp on all the possible option schemas available, and I'm sure there is likely a better one for this case.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\n\r\n// incorrect usage `no-multi-assign` with { \"onlyForVariableDeclation\": true }\r\nconst tree = { numberOfLeaves: 9 };\r\nconst numberOfLeaves = tree.numberOfLeaves = 10; // would error out\r\n\r\n// correct usage `no-multi-assign` with { \"onlyForVariableDeclation\": true }\r\nconst x = {};\r\nconst y = {};\r\nx.hi = y.hi = \"salutations\"; // acceptable\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\nIt errors out both when declaring variables in the statement as well as when no declaring.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\nYou will have the option to only error out when declaring variables\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nI am, though this is likely a simple change, and I have not set up the eslint dev environment before. If someone else feels passionately, then likely I won't be the most efficient implementer. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a copy of the rule, outfitted with a first pass at the changes, for review:\r\n\r\n<details> <summary> no-multi-assign.js with added option</summary>\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * @fileoverview Rule to check use of chained assignment expressions\r\n * @author Stewart Rand\r\n */\r\n\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n\r\n\r\n//------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n// Rule Definition\r\n//------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  meta: {\r\n    type: \"suggestion\",\r\n\r\n    docs: {\r\n      description: \"disallow use of chained assignment expressions\",\r\n      category: \"Stylistic Issues\",\r\n      recommended: false,\r\n      url: \"https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-multi-assign\"\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    schema: [ {\r\n      type: \"object\",\r\n      onlyForVariableDeclation: {\r\n        type: \"boolean\",\r\n        default: false\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  create( context ) {\r\n\r\n    const options = context.options[ 0 ] || {};\r\n    const onlyForVariableDeclation = options.onlyForVariableDeclation;\r\n    const disallowedParents = [ \"VariableDeclarator\" ].concat( onlyForVariableDeclation ?
