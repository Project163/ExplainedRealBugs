Here's one:\r\n\r\n> Here's a simple example of a .eslintignore file:\r\n>  node_modules/*\r\n\r\n2. Also on https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring , the need to ignore `node_modules` seems implicit here as well:\r\n\r\n> \"ignorePatterns\": [\"temp.js\", \"node_modules/\"],\r\n\r\n3. While the following implies the opposite, I think the text could be clarified here a bit too:\r\n\r\n> In addition to any patterns in a .eslintignore file, ESLint always ignores files in /node_modules/* and /bower_components/*.\r\n> ...\r\n> \\# /node_modules/* and /bower_components/* in the project root are ignored by default\r\n\r\nThe first line is confusing as it seems to suggest one cannot get linting of `node_modules` or `bower_components` yet it is possible to reenable both of them with `!`.\r\n\r\n**Your take on the correct solution to problem.**\r\n\r\n1. Remove `node_modules` from the examples unless to point out that one can undo the default (it may be helpful to mention that `!.eslintrc.js` (or `!.*.js`) can be added back too, at least until eslint 7 may change this behavior for `!.eslintrc.js`).\r\n2. For the third case, I think it should instead say in the first line \"ESLint always ignores files by default in ...\" since I am (thankfully!) able to reapply linting of `node_modules` (or `bower_components`) by adding `!node_modules/**` to an ignore (within an `.eslintignore` file or by a command such as `$(npm bin)/eslint --no-inline-config --ignore-pattern='!node_modules/**' .`). (I truly hope this functionality will never be dropped, btw!)\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nNot at this time.","closed_by":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
