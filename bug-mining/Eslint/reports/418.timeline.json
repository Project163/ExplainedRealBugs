(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nThe bulk of our tests for rule schemas are isolated unit tests of `ConfigValidator`. This is a single test to be sure we actually run rule schema validation end-to-end and prevent cases like #13793.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nHere's my checklist for the patch release tomorrow. Am I missing anything?\r\n\r\n- [x] Merge https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/pull/14.\r\n- [x] Run a patch release of `@eslint/eslintrc`.\r\n- [x] Push a commit to this branch to bump the `@eslint/eslintrc` dependency to `v0.2.1`.\r\n- [x] Remove the \"blocked\" label.\r\n- [x] Rename the pull request to title to \"Fix\" and \"fixes\".\r\n- [x] Merge this.\r\n- [x] Merge any other patch release fixes.\r\n- [x] Run a patch release of `eslint`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13794/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-26T17:23:28Z","updated_at":"2020-10-26T17:23:28Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslintrc/issues/15","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslintrc","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslintrc/issues/15/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslintrc/issues/15/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslintrc/issues/15/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/issues/15","id":729759259,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3Mjk3NTkyNTk=","number":15,"title":"Test
