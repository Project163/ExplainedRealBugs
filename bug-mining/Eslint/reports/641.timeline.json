ESLint version\n\nHEAD\n\n### What problem do you want to solve?\n\nESLint has a lot of core rules that simply move whitespace around. After years of maintaining these rules, I personally believe two things:\r\n\r\n1. ESLint is not the right tool for source code formatting. Having each augmentation of whitespace as a separate rule just doesn't scale and forces us to continue to add exceptions and new rules whenever new syntax is added. This type of whitespace management is better handled holistically by source code formatters.\r\n2. It's getting harder to maintain these rules and people aren't as willing to do so. The indent rule, for example, currently has [eight open issues](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aindent), most of which have been open for over a year. The complexity of this rule alone takes away from the time we can spend on more impactful changes.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nI'd like to deprecate all formatting rules (anything that is adjusting whitespace) in v9 and recommend that people use a source code formatter instead. Both [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [dprint](https://dprint.dev/) are viable options that solve the same problems in different ways.\r\n\r\nThis would free us up from maintaining a large number of core rules and make it easy for us to drop these rules during the rewrite.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No

up on https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17522 & #19: I think there is a small discrepancy between the name _(stylistic)_ of this plugin and what it's going to be used by most devs as at time of announcement _(formatting)_. https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17522 mentions several rules that aren't covered by some or all formatters, but debatably may fall into the category of _stylistic_ rules this plugin should cover:\r\n\r\n* `curly`\r\n* `padding-line-between-statements`\r\n* `no-unexpected-multiline`\r\n* `no-mixed-operators`\r\n\r\nWould it be reasonable to include these rules in eslint-stylistic, but only enable them in a dedicated config for non-formatting stylistic rules? If not, and this config really is just for the formatting rules, maybe it should be named eslint-formatting after all? (is that a false dichotomy?)\r\n\r\nFor anecdotal context/evidence, in https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app (which uses Prettier for formatting):\r\n\r\n* curly is provided by
