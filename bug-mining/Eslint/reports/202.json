(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?**\r\n\r\n- I want to change the default behavior. But I'm OK if it's behind an option.\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\nconfig:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nglobals:\r\n  window: readable\r\nrules:\r\n  no-redeclare:\r\n    - error\r\n    - builtinGlobals: true\r\n```\r\n\r\ncode:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/*globals window */\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?**\r\n\r\n- Does nothing.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?**\r\n\r\n- Reports the `window` in `/*globals*/` comment because it's declared already.\r\n\r\nFor a reference, [no-unused-vars] rule reports unused variables that `/*globals*/` comment defined. For example:\r\n\r\n> ```js\r\n> /*globals foo */ //ERROR: 'foo' is defined, but never used.\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> https://eslint.org/demo/#eyJ0ZXh0IjoiLypnbG9iYWxzIGZvbyAqLyIsIm9wdGlvbnMiOnsicGFyc2VyT3B0aW9ucyI6eyJlY21hVmVyc2lvbiI6OCwic291cmNlVHlwZSI6Im1vZHVsZSIsImVjbWFGZWF0dXJlcyI6e319LCJydWxlcyI6eyJuby11bnVzZWQtdmFycyI6Mn0sImVudiI6e319fQ==\r\n\r\nTherefore, this change makes consistent between [no-unused-vars] rule and [no-redeclare] rule.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?**\r\n\r\nYes, I will do.\r\n\r\n[no-redeclare]: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-redeclare\r\n[no-unused-vars]: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-vars\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mysticatea","id":1937871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mzc4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1937871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea","html_url":"https://github.com/mysticatea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysticatea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11370/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11370/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
