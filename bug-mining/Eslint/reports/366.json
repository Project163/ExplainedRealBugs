(New option, new default behavior, etc.)?** new default behavior\r\n\r\n**Please provide some example code that this change will affect:**\r\n\r\nCurrently, `require-await` is enabled for both async functions **and** async generators.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this when it comes to generators is that the return value of an async generator contains symbols that a regular generator does not, making it quite different from async functions which are just regular functions that return promises. \r\n\r\nSince generators yield rather than return a value, an async generator might yield all the values of another async generator without ever actually needing to use await.\r\n\r\n<!-- Put your code examples here -->\r\n```js\r\nasync function * () {\r\n  yield * anotherAsyncGenerator()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you remove the async syntax the generator will fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n```TypeError: yield* (intermediate value) is not iterable```\r\n\r\nYou can’t actually yield * of an async generator from a regular generator because the generator has to have the right symbols in order to be consumed properly. The VM guards against this and gives us a rather obtuse error.\r\n\r\nIMO, it’s probably best to just disable await checking for async generators.\r\n\r\n**What does the rule currently do for this code?** It fails on the required form and will not pass unless disabled.\r\n\r\n**What will the rule do after it's changed?** Not check async generators for await.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change?** Nope.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12459/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/12459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
