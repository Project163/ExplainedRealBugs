(put an \"X\" next to an item)\r\n\r\n[X] Other, please explain:\r\n\r\nrefs #13569\r\n\r\nChanges the following rules and helper functions in order to support logical assignments:\r\n\r\n* `operator-assignment` rule to NOT report `&&=`, `||=`, and `??=` for now.\r\n* `astUtils.couldBeError` to return `true` for code such as `foo &&= 5`. Also, to return `false` for code such as `foo += bar` (this change can produce more warnings).\r\n* `constructor-super` to treat classes such as `class A extends (B &&= 5)` as those that extend a constructor. Also, to treat classes such as `class A extends (B += C)` as those that don't extend a constructor (this change can produce more warnings).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    If the item you've checked above has a template, please paste the template questions below and answer them.

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nFixed the above, and also added tests for: `operator-linebreak`, `space-infix-ops`, `no-invalid-this`, `no-param-reassign`, `no-bitwise`, `func-names-matching`, `prefer-destrucuring`, and `no-extend-native`.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n* `operator-assignment`\r\n\r\n I'm not sure what would be the best course of action for the `operator-assignment` rule.\r\n\r\nWithout any changes, that rule would (and currently does when used with `@babel/eslint-parser`) report `x &&= y`, `x ||= y`, and `x ??= y` if the option is `\"never\"`, but not `x = x && y`, `x = x || y`, and `x = x ?? y` if the option is `\"always\"`.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly inconsistent and should be fixed, either to report both directions or neither of them.\r\n\r\nI fixed the rule to ignore  `x &&= y`, `x ||= y`, and `x ??= y` for now, with an idea to add an option for logical operators in a subsequent release. Logical assignments are a bit different from other assignments due to their short-circuiting semantics, so a separate configuration might make sense anyway.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fix the rule to report `x = x && y`, `x = x || y`, and `x = x ?? y` by default, but only if `ecmaVersion` is set to `2021` or above (which might be missing in a configuration for a third-party parser).\r\n\r\n* The `complexity` rule: logical assignments should probably increase complexity. This looks to me like a breaking change for users of `@babel/eslint-parser`, so I think we should make this change in the next major version, rather than now.\r\n* `no-constant-condition`: This rule should probably report conditions such as `if (foo ||= true) {}`. However, the existing code which would be used for this change has some issues that should be fixed first (see https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13245#discussion_r418571282 and other comments below). I guess we could make this change later, either in a minor or major version.\r\n* `no-self-assign`: It might make sense to consider reporting `x &&= x` and other logical assignments to itself.\r\n* `func-names`: `x &&= function () {}`, and other two logical assignment operators, do assign function's `name` automatically. Our documentation for `as-needed` says \"requires function expressions to have a name, if the name cannot be assigned automatically in an ES6 environment\". Should we reword this?\r\n* Several rules and helper functions assume that `AssigmentExpression` is always the `=` direct assignment. In other words, they don't check the assignment's operator, and thus have some false positives or false negatives with `+=`, `-=` etc. I fixed only `astUtils.couldBeError` and `constructor-super` now, because only these two wouldn't work well with logical assignments. For other rules, this possible oversight turned out to be correct behavior for `&&=`, `||=`, and `??=`, so I didn't fix them now for `+=`, `-=` and other operators (I'll do that in another PR, since it's an existing issue unrelated to logical

All three are looking for a specific type of truthy value from the expression. Because the expression uses `&&`, any possibly-valid value would evaluate to the right side of the expression, which would not be a valid value in these examples.\r\n\r\nThis was originally discovered in https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13618#discussion_r479584827. Because it relates to existing behavior that existed prior to that pull request, we decided to split it into its own issue that can be fixed after the pull request is merged. This bug is a false negative in the 3 rules above, and fixing it would cause them to report more errors. Does anyone object to fixing this in a semver-minor change as allowed by our semver policy?\r\n\r\nThe fix would update both [`astUtils.couldBeError()`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/a32032430a0779a4e3b2d137d4d0682844084b82/lib/rules/utils/ast-utils.js#L1587-L1588) and [`constructor-super`'s `isPossibleConstructor()`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/a32032430a0779a4e3b2d137d4d0682844084b82/lib/rules/constructor-super.js#L65-L69) to only check the right side of `&&` `LogicalExpression`s.\r\n\r\n**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**\r\n\r\nNo errors are reported.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Please ensure your pull request is ready:\r\n\r\n    - Read the pull request guide (https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/pull-requests)\r\n    - Include tests for this change\r\n    - Update documentation for this change (if appropriate)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    The following is required for all pull requests:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What changes did you make? (Give an overview)\r\n\r\nWhen `constructor-super`, `no-throw-literal`, and `prefer-promise-reject-errors` are looking for plausible constructor or error values, they fail to consider the short-circuiting behavior differences between the `&&` and `||` operators. This results in a false negative where these rules allow `foo && 42` when that expression cannot be a constructor or error. If the left side is falsy, the expression short-circuits with the falsy value. If the left side is truthy, the result of the expression is the right side value. All three rules already report the right side value in isolation but currently incorrectly allow it when on the right side of an `&&` expression.\r\n\r\nWhen @mdjermanovic added support for logical assignment operators in #13618, [we decided](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13618#discussion_r479584827) to ship with the corrected behavior for `&&=` by only checking the right side of the expression, accepting that treatment of `&&=` would be inconsistent with existing treatment of `&&`. This PR then fixes the `&&` treatment in what we believe can be a semver-minor bug fix.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nDoes everyone else agree with @mdjermanovic and me that this is can be a semver-minor bug fix?\r\n\r\nA future improvement could detect statically falsy values on the left side of `&&` expressions and report those as well. Such a change could also update the `||` treatment to ignore plausibly-(constructor|error) values on the right side if the left side is statically truthy but not plausibly a constructor or error, so `42 || foo` should
