This would be the expected type of the default export of a formatter module (a [TypeScript example](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-formatter-pretty/blob/decbd28/index.d.ts#L12-L15)).\r\n\r\nBy contrast, there exists a type [`Formatter`](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api#-formatter-type) which is used for a different purpose: it is the type of a value resolved by `eslint.loadFormatter`. This is an object with a method named `format` that accepts a single argument.\n\n### What do you think is the correct solution?\n\nAdding a type definition for the signature of a formatter function would be useful as a guideline to work with custom formatters and other tools that deal with those formatters, in the same way the type definitions for e.g. `Rule` or `Plugin` help with rules and plugins.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [X] I am willing to submit a pull request for this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nI could submit a PR if desired, but I would probably need some input from the team, for example about naming conventions.","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15654/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
