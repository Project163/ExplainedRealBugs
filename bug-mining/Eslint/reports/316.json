(place an \"X\" next to just one item)**\r\n\r\n[ ] Enforces code style\r\n[x] Warns about a potential error\r\n[ ] Suggests an alternate way of doing something\r\n[ ] Other (please specify:)\r\n\r\n**Provide 2-3 code examples that this rule will warn about:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function then() {\r\n  return \"foo\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction v() {return 123;}\r\nexport {v as then};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why should this rule be included in ESLint (instead of a plugin)?**\r\nModule namespace objects are frozen - they're supposed to conceptually represent a static, pre-runtime-determined, representation of an ES Module. It's very very surprising that a module could suddenly become thenable, breaking its consumers, or suddenly become *not* thenable, also breaking its consumers.\r\n\r\nThis rule will help prevent problematic exports in the first place by warning when they are created.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10428/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
