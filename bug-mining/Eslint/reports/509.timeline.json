this may be a case where two rules produce valid fixes that result in an invalid code when they're applied together.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what happens.\r\n\r\nWith this configuration:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    plugins: [\"import\"],\r\n    rules: {\r\n        \"comma-dangle\": [\"error\", { imports: \"always-multiline\" }],\r\n        \"import/no-duplicates\": [\"error\"]\r\n    },\r\n    parserOptions: {\r\n        sourceType: \"module\",\r\n        ecmaVersion: 2022\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {\r\n  StyleSheet,\r\n  View,\r\n  TextInput,\r\n  ImageBackground,\r\n  Image,\r\n  TouchableOpacity,\r\n  SafeAreaView\r\n} from 'react-native';\r\nimport { I18nManager } from 'react-native';\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe two rules produce the following fixes:\r\n\r\n* comma-dangle: `\"fix\":{\"range\":[106,106],\"text\":\",\"}}`\r\n* import/no-duplicates: `\"fix\":{\"range\":[107,173],\"text\":\", I18nManager } from 'react-native';\\n\"}}`\r\n\r\nSince the ranges are not overlapping, both fixes will be applied in the same pass:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {\r\n  StyleSheet,\r\n  View,\r\n  TextInput,\r\n  ImageBackground,\r\n  Image,\r\n  TouchableOpacity,\r\n  SafeAreaView,\r\n, I18nManager } from 'react-native';\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat results in two commas, which is a parsing error.
