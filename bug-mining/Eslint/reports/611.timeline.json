replacement. They recommended using the [eslint-plugin-jsdoc](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) plugin, but I would recommend using the TypeScript compiler instead (it supports checking JS code), as it is built into many editors by default (such as VS Code) and it can also validate the data types. Using it just requires adding a few keys to the `compilerOptions` section of the existing [jsconfig.json](https://github.com/TinyWebEx/AddonTemplate/blob/master/jsconfig.json) file, such as:\r\n```json\r\n    \"module\": \"es2021\",\r\n    \"checkJs\": true,\r\n    \"strict\": true,\r\n    \"noImplicitAny\": false,\r\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\r\n    \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\r\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\r\n```\r\nSee the documentation for more information: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html\r\n\r\nUsing this to check Unicodify and the Awesome Emoji Picker found a significant number of JSDoc (mostly incorrect datatypes) and other issues, which I can summit respective PRs to fix if you want.\r\n\r\nMozilla
