wanted to work on eslint and this seemed like a 'good first issue' to pick up. \r\n\r\n**My findings:**\r\nI dug a bit deeper and found that the parser used by eslint(espree using acorn) is throwing this error in strict mode.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the error is thrown from here https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/blob/0d20f67b03e0784bdd18eb88e0f76e6a53043404/src/tokenize.js#L631\r\n\r\nAs for the fix there, this will not occur if you disable the 'strict' rule.\r\n\r\nThis is the file that i tried to replicate this issue\r\n```js\r\n\"use strict\";\r\nfunction testIssue10031() {\r\n    return \"\\033\" + \"postfix\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis threw me the error\r\n```bash\r\n  4:13  error  Parsing error: Octal literal in strict mode\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf i disable the 'strict' rule, i get the proper rule suggestion for it\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint strict: 0 */\r\nfunction testIssue10031() {\r\n    return \"\\033\" + \"postfix\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n  2:1   error  Missing JSDoc comment

Use '\\u....' instead  no-octal-escape\r\n  3:19  error  Unexpected string concatenation of literals    no-useless-concat\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs eslint, i gather reports parse errors as also eslint errors, how should i proceed here? Should this be considered as a bug to be fixed?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/369547335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MuraliNunna","id":2618969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTg5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2618969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna","html_url":"https://github.com/MuraliNunna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/369673074","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10031#issuecomment-369673074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10031","id":369673074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2OTY3MzA3NA==","user":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-01T17:48:34Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T17:48:34Z","body":"@MuraliNunna Thanks for looking into this! You're correct that ESLint just catches parser errors and reports them as linting errors. However, I think there are a few issues with the test code that you're using, which are preventing it from being a good demonstration of this issue.\r\n\r\n* The test code is running in strict mode, due to the `\"use strict\"` directive at the top. However, using octal escape sequences is a syntax error in strict mode, regardless of whether it's in a template literal, so the `prefer-template` rule never runs in that case.\r\n* The test code is concatenating two string literals (`\"\\033\"` and `\"postfix\"`). However, the `prefer-template` rule only reports an error when concatenating a string literal with something other than a string literal (e.g. a variable).\r\n\r\nHave you tried using the example code and configuration that were provided in the original issue? I think if the source file only contains `'\\033' + foo` (with nothing else), and only the `prefer-template` rule is enabled, it will be easier to trigger this bug.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/369673074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1499568872,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ5OTU2ODg3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1499568872","actor":{"login":"MuraliNunna","id":2618969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTg5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2618969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna","html_url":"https://github.com/MuraliNunna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-01T17:48:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1499568874,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0OTk1Njg4NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/1499568874","actor":{"login":"MuraliNunna","id":2618969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTg5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2618969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna","html_url":"https://github.com/MuraliNunna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuraliNunna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-01T17:48:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/382498093","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/10031#issuecomment-382498093","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10031","id":382498093,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjQ5ODA5Mw==","user":{"login":"malcolmsgroves","id":26167038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTY3MDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26167038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves","html_url":"https://github.com/malcolmsgroves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malcolmsgroves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api
