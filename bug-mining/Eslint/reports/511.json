What rule do you want to change?\n\nno-unused-vars\n\n### What change to do you want to make?\n\nGenerate fewer warnings\n\n### How do you think the change should be implemented?\n\nA new option\n\n### Example code\n\n```js\n// With the following option set within eslintrc rules\r\n// \"no-unused-vars\": [\"error\", { \"destructuredArrayIgnorePattern\": \"^_\" }],\r\n\r\nconst array = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\r\n\r\nconst [a, _b, c] = array;\r\n\r\nconst newArray = [a, c];\r\n\r\n// No \"no-unused-vars\" error on _b\n```\n\n\n### What does the rule currently do for this code?\n\nCurrently `_b` would be seen as an unused variable.\n\n### What will the rule do after it's changed?\n\nThe proposed rule would allow a pattern to be set to ignore certain deconstructed array variables from triggering `no-unused-vars`.\r\n\r\nIt would essentially work in the same way as the existing `argsIgnorePattern` option for `no-unused-vars`.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [ ] I am willing to submit a pull request to implement this change.\n\n### Additional comments\n\nCurrently it is possible to avoid the `no-unused-vars` error by changing the example code to the following:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [a, , c] = array;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever in my opinion this doesn't read as well as either\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [a, _b, c] = array;\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [a, _, c] = array;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd so it would be great to have this option.","closed_by":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15611/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15611/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
