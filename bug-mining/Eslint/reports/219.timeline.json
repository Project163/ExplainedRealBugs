for the issue. To summarize what I believe you're saying: you want to be able to lint JavaScript inside of a Vue template that ends with a `.md` extension. Is that correct? (If not, please feel free to correct me and don't bother reading the next bits because it won't be helpful.)\r\n\r\nAssuming that is correct, I think you're running into what I think was a design flaw of the processor mechanism. Requiring plugins to specify a file extension to match processors to is a bit backward from the way the rest of ESLint works. (Chances are, I'm the one who designed it, so you can blame me.)\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this, I think what we should be looking at is a way to specify a processor in a config, probably as part of an `overrides` setting. That might require a change to how plugins expose processors so it's easier to reference from a config.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I think this is a problem worth solving.\r\n\r\n@btmills what do you
