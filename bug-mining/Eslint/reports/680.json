Environment\n\nNode version: v20.10.0\nnpm version: v10.2.3\nLocal ESLint version: v9.24.0 (Currently used)\nGlobal ESLint version: Not found\nOperating System: darwin 23.6.0\n\n### What parser are you using?\n\nDefault (Espree)\n\n### What did you do?\n\nI've created a new ESLint plugin to support PHP using [`php-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/php-parser).\n\nThis parser returns the AST with `kind` instead of `type`, so according to the docs I should've set `nodeTypeKey` to `kind`.\n\nTook me a while to figure out why none of my selectors were working (except `*`), but after reading through the code, I noticed that the `NodeEventGenerator` doesn't take the `nodeTypeKey` into account:\n\nhttps://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/1b870c9da4b3aa28f4a6f4f62e0437b743344994/lib/linter/node-event-generator.js#L349-L353\n\nI have a local patch that works, will open a PR once this issue is accepted 😄 \n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\n`nodeTypeKey` being taken into account.\n\n### What actually happened?\n\nIt wasn't.\n\n### Link to Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n.\n\n### Participation\n\n- [x] I am willing to submit a pull request for this issue.\n\n### Additional comments\n\n_No
