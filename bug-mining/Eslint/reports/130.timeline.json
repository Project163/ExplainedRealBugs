I'm sorry for coming here with misinformation :(. But regardless, the difference is explained pretty well here: https://jakearchibald.com/2017/await-vs-return-vs-return-await/\r\n\r\nBasically, the issue is that when you do `return <a promise>`, it leaves the function with a promise, and then it's resolved. You can think of it like every async functions being implicitly wrapped in `Promise.resolve` I guess. This means that you exit the try block before the promise is resolved (or rejected).\r\n\r\nI don't know where in the spec this is described, as I don't normally read the javascript spec, but I would guess it's for the same reason that in `promise.then` you can return both normal values and new promises. Essentially it implements both `.map` and `.flatMap` (or `map` and `bind` if you're into Haskell and friends).\r\n\r\nThis behavior makes me wish I could have a linter tell me to always require `await` before return on an async value instead of never because if you leave it out and then refactor into a try-catch, it can bite you in the ass. But that would require a type-system, so I get that that's not really doable in eslint. But the fact that there is a linter rule that encourages you to remove `await` before `return` makes me worried that there will be developers who do not understand these semantics, and will take the linter rules as \"good advice\". Then they will be left with subtle bugs in their code, and not understand why it's not invoking their catch handler (which is a pretty absurd issue to try to

have two issues with `no-return-await`.\r\n\r\n#### When there are multiple `awaits`\r\n\r\n`no-return-await` tells you to change\r\n```js\r\nasync function myFunc() {\r\n  await anotherFunc();\r\n  return await anotherFunc2();\r\n}\r\n```\r\ninto\r\n```js\r\nasync function myFunc() {\r\n  await anotherFunc();\r\n  return anotherFunc2();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is OK, until you start doing a `try...catch` here:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function myFunc() {\r\n  try {\r\n    await anotherFunc();\r\n    return anotherFunc2();\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    // Catches rejections from `anotherFunc`, but not from `anotherFunc2`\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere if you add `await` after the `return` again, `eslint` will not complain anymore.\r\nBut you've most of the time already removed it, and it doesn't jump to my eyes that `anotherFunc2` errors won't be catched.\r\n\r\n#### When there's only one await\r\n\r\nFor me, things are even worse with only one `await`.\r\n`no-return-await` tells you to change\r\n```js\r\nasync function myFunc() {\r\n  return await anotherFunc();\r\n}\r\n```\r\ninto\r\n```js\r\nasync function myFunc() {\r\n  return anotherFunc();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich `require-await` tells you to change to:\r\n```js\r\nfunction myFunc() {\r\n  return anotherFunc();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuddenly, you have the same issue than the previous one, plus this function isn't marked `async` anymore, but you still need to `await` it if you call it.\r\nNow if you add a `try...catch` but don't know if `anotherFunc` is `async`, it's now even worse, because you have no indication whatsoever that there's `async` stuff going on there:\r\n```js\r\nfunction myFunc() {\r\n  try {\r\n    return anotherFunc();\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    // Looks 100% legit, not even an `async` keyword to tip us off\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### An alternative solution\r\n\r\nThere's another pattern where `eslint` won't complain:\r\n```js\r\nasync function myFunc() {\r\n  const res = await anotherFunc();\r\n  return res;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that I know about it, I'm thinking about using it everywhere I have such `returns` of non-explicit promises.\r\n\r\n#### Drawback\r\n\r\nI assume that:\r\n```js\r\nasync function myFunc() {\r\n  return await anotherFunc();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill actually create a wrapper promise on top of the other one, which could be concerning performance-wise.\r\nI also believe that this is a case that should be easily optimizable by the compiler though.\r\nFinally, I believe that the better clarity outweighs clearly the creation of a useless `Promise` instance.\r\n\r\ncc @vvo @Haroenv who I pinged on Slack

this still needs help, I am interested in taking this one on.  I'll probably need a week or so (July 31st).\r\n\r\nIt seems like the page that needs updating is [this one](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-return-await).  As you guys already mentioned, the following case is already on the page under \"The following patterns are not warnings:\"\r\n\r\n> async function foo() {\r\n  try {\r\n    return await bar();\r\n  } catch (error) {}\r\n} \r\n\r\nSo no need to update that part.  But, I can see where Alxandr is coming from, it seems like the top paragraph is a little misleading, saying in the first line:\r\n\r\n> Inside an async function, return await is useless.\r\n\r\nIt is a little bit confusing that the rule says return await is useless and then further on down the page, says it allows it under some circumstances.  I'd like to go in and clean up that first paragraph a little bit to make it clearer what is meant.\r\n\r\nLMK if any issues with my taking this on.  Otherwise, I'll get to it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/407454090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marla294","id":26346642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzQ2NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26346642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294","html_url":"https://github.com/marla294","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marla294/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/407464239","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9695#issuecomment-407464239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9695","id":407464239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzQ2NDIzOQ==","user":{"login":"platinumazure","id":284282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDI4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure","html_url":"https://github.com/platinumazure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/platinumazure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-24T16:14:32Z","updated_at":"2018-07-24T16:14:32Z","body":"@not-an-aardvark Any direction you want to provide in response to [this comment](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9695#issuecomment-407454090)?
