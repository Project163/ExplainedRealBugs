Perhaps we could change this logic a bit to fix the bug - if `value` is not on the same line as `key`, then property doesn't continue the group?\r\n\r\nThis should be fine with `align: \"value\"`.

So, for instance, this code is currently considered ok by the rule:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* eslint \"key-spacing\": [\"error\", { align: \"colon\" }] */\r\n({\r\n  command  : \"npm\",\r\n  arguments:\r\n

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\n* Changed the logic in rule `key-spacing` to ensure that properties whose value starts on a new line are not grouped with any previously defined properties.\r\n* Moved around function `isKeyValueProperty` in key-spacing.js to comply with lint settings.\r\n* Added unit tests to rule `key-spacing`.\r\n* Extended some existing unit tests for rule `key-spacing` to check that properties whose value starts on a new line are allowed regardless of spacing after the colon (for default `afterColon` settings) and not grouped with any successively defined properties. This is the current behavior, but it was missing unit tests.\r\n\r\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD004
