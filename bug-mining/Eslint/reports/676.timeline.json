for the report. I can reproduce this.\n\nSo, the problem here is because you aren't using a configuration file and you're trying to lint a `.ts` file, which is not configured by default. ESLint only configures `.js`, `.cjs`, and `.mjs` by default, so all of the command-line options that take the place of a config file are only applied to those files and the one you passed on the command line doesn't match, so it's skipped. This is clearly an oversight in how everything works together.\n\nI'm not sure what the right solution is for this. On the one hand, if `--no-config-lookup` is passed, we could assume that you intend for other options to be applied to just the files passed on the command line, but that would also mean you wouldn't be able to just pass a directory because we'd have no idea what you wanted to lint in there. \n\nAnother approach would be to add back the `--ext` command line option that we initially removed with flag config. That would allow you to explicitly pass which files should match the other options on the command line.\n\n@eslint/eslint-team
