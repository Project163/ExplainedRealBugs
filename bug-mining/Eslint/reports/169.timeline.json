We probably are just generating a JSON-stringified version of the configuration and embedding that into the config file.\r\n\r\nI suspect this also applies to any other question (i.e., might ignore Windows/Unix line endings, might ignore indent settings, will preserve semicolon even if semicolons are stated not to be used, etc.).\r\n\r\nI wonder if, for JavaScript configs only, we should just new up a CLIEngine instance and lint the config file (with that same file passed in as the config)?

As described in #9947, this change makes `--init` run generated JS config files through the equivalent of `eslint --fix` to make sure they follow the selected linting rules.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\nThis is my first contribution to ESLint, so let me know if I need to change anything! The only weird part about the code change is the `require` on line 293 to get `CLIEngine`. This require cannot be at the top of the file because of a circular dependency between `config-file.js` and `cli-engine.js`.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11337/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2120554419,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjEyMDU1NDQxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2120554419","actor":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"d0e823aef196a6564c87a78b72c1ef980ce67af9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/commits/d0e823aef196a6564c87a78b72c1ef980ce67af9","created_at":"2019-02-06T08:19:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2144662091,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNDQ2NjIwOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2144662091","actor":{"login":"marcuspoehls","id":837771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzc3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls","html_url":"https://github.com/marcuspoehls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcuspoehls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7b98d4ab17d4b3d61213a38564ebbad1a31d23bb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/futurestudio/hapi-geo-locate/commits/7b98d4ab17d4b3d61213a38564ebbad1a31d23bb","created_at":"2019-02-17T12:25:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2145156164,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxNDUxNTYxNjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/2145156164","actor":{"login":"ntwb","id":1016458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTY0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1016458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb","html_url":"https://github.com/ntwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f14d358801edc6bc582521affbfbd09346824335","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stylelint/stylelint/commits/f14d358801edc6bc582521affbfbd09346824335","created_at":"2019-02-18T03:19:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
