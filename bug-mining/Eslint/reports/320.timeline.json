TypeScript 之前, 学习 JavaScript/ECMAScript(简称 JS) 最好的老师就是 ESLint.\r\n\r\n是 ESLint 让我学习 JS, 并使用 JS 到现在的.\r\n\r\n大多数情况下我都是不建议自己完善规则的, 因为 Airbnb 的规则已经足够好用了, React 也有自己的规则建议. 并且 TypeScript 能做的更多.\r\n\r\n最近在整理微信小程序的项目, 在为这个项目完善 ESLint 规则的时候, 顺便也整理一份文字出来, 讲讲我这样设置的原因.\r\n\r\n我的简短文字更像是笔记, 希望大家对照着 [ESLint 自带的规则](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) 来看.\r\n\r\n被推荐的规则, 建议大家遵循, 同时建议没看过的同学在有空时翻看一下.\r\n\r\n针对没有添加到 `eslint:recommended` 的, 下面逐一说:\r\n\r\n## 避免错误\r\n\r\n### `no-await-in-loop` 不允许在循环中嵌套 await.\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n我的原因很简单, 就是当想避免同时并发时, 在循环里 `await wait('100ms');fetch('something');` 还是有意义的.\r\n\r\n### `no-console` 不允许控制台输出\r\n\r\n🟢使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果真是希望长期留存输出, 建议大家通过一个函数进行包裹, 然后仅在该函数中使用, 然后通过注释 `disable-eslint` 来避免报错.\r\n\r\n### `no-extra-parens` 不使用没必要的括号.\r\n\r\n🟢使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这里有一些小知识点, 比如算术运算符是遵循数学的, 乘除号优先级一样, 但逻辑运算符可不是. 推荐大家看看[MDN 关于运算符优先级的相关文档](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence), 比如 `&&` 是优先于 `||` 的.\r\n\r\n### `no-template-curly-in-string` 普通字符串中不使用参数占位符\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n为了避免本来使用重音符但使用了引号的情况, 要求普通字符串中不能出现参数占位符. 是一点限制, 但基本不会有人故意在普通字符串中非要使用参数占位符, 如果非要, 那就用编码吧, 比如 `'\\u0024{}'`.\r\n\r\n### [7.0] `no-useless-backreference`\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n这是[最近才添加](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12673)的新规则, 关于字符串正则的, 我们很少写正则.\r\n\r\n因为 7.0  版本还在测试, [直接进入 404](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/12673#issuecomment-596905026), 可以通过[这里](https://eslint.org/docs/7.0.0/rules/no-useless-backreference)看文档.\r\n\r\n### `require-atomic-updates` 涉及异步时, 优先执行异步\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n虽然我们尽量写纯函数, 避免这种用法是可能的. 之所以会出现这样的问题, 也算是因为 JavaScript 的糟粕吧, 没有指针.\r\n\r\n## 最佳实践\r\n\r\n### `accessor-pairs` 要求 Get 和 Set 同时出现\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果只 Set, 没有 Get, 那么使用 Set 就是毫无意义的. 不过反之则可能是真实需求, 所以使用默认规则只限制前者即可.\r\n\r\n### `array-callback-return` 数组某些方法的回调函数要求一定有返回值\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n我们遇到过本该使用 for 却使用 map 的代码. 该规则能一定程度上避免问题, 但无法检测出有人随便返回了一个值的情况. 所以还是要大家统一思想啊, 尽量写明确, 简洁, 清晰的代码.\r\n\r\n### `block-scoped-var` 无视 var 的作用域 hoisting\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n在没有 let/const 时, 这个功能有用. 在 ES6 之后, 使用 `no-var` 就可避免这种语言问题.\r\n\r\n### `class-methods-use-this` 类的方法必须使用 this\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果一个类的方法没有使用到 this, 那么写成静态方法或者纯函数更好.\r\n\r\n### `complexity` 嵌套复杂度\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"error\", 10]`\r\n\r\n尽量将每个函数写小一点, 增加代码可读性. 但考虑到整体团队和项目具体的情况, 需要选择一个合适的值.\r\n\r\n### `consistent-return` 一致性的返回\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n帮助我们思考, 这个函数为什么要这样用, 该不该这样用, 同时避免一些低级错误如 map 的特殊情况忘了返回默认值.\r\n\r\n### `curly` 要求写大括号\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n主要算是代码风格上的要求. 但也是因为 JS 的大括号省略规则可读性差, 还是写个大括号吧.\r\n\r\n### `default-case` 要求 switch 必须有 default\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n主要是为了避免手误.\r\n\r\n### [7.0] `default-case-last` 要求 switch 的 default 必须在末尾\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n从语义上理解, 将兜底方案放在末尾是可读性最佳的. 可以通过[这里](https://eslint.org/docs/7.0.0/rules/default-case-last)看文档.\r\n\r\n### `default-param-last` 函数有默认值的参数必须在最后\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在 JS 中函数可以有多个参数, 一般前面的必填, 后面的选填. 否则就会造成使用不便, 每次请求的时候都要传个无效值, 如 `foo(undefined, 1)`. 有默认值的参数都是可选, 所以放在最好方面函数的使用.\r\n\r\n另外, 如果有多个可选参数, 建议使用 `foo(need, options = {})` 的方式定义函数, 将可选参数都放入 `options` 内.\r\n\r\n### `dot-location` 属性点号的位置\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"error\", \"property\"]`.\r\n\r\n这是关于风格一致性的约束. 不过实际中我们很少针对对象属性换行, 因为需要换行的时候, 一定是比较长了, 但我们需要避免这么长的命名出现. 如果真的需要, 我们希望在行首能知道, 同时要有缩进.\r\n\r\n### `dot-notation` 必须使用点号来访问属性\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果我们使用驼峰式命名, 那么这个一般是必要的. 但特殊情况下我们要处理后端直接返回的下划线风格命名时, 比如 SQL 列名, 就会出现问题, 建议遇到实际情况并且需要, 再使用 `allowPattern` 选项来允许特殊情况.\r\n\r\n### `eqeqeq` 必须使用全等\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n首先, 非全等并不会更快, 因为非全等是做了隐性的类型转换. 其次, 所有隐性的类型转换都是不建议的, 只会让错误更容易发生(哪怕只提升了 0.00001% 的错误概率), 并不能提高开发效率.\r\n\r\n在一些情况下, 有人希望使用 `== null` 来同时判断 null 与 undefined. 但我不建议这样做, 如果需要这样的判断, 单独做一个函数, 在函数内进行 disable rule 就行了.\r\n\r\n### `grouped-accessor-pairs` 要求 Get/Set 相邻\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是一个代码可读性的问题, 一个属性的 Get/Set 要相邻. 这个大家应该都同意吧.\r\n\r\n### `guard-for-in` 谨慎使用 for in\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在大多数业务代码中, 都不需要使用 `for in`, 建议大家使用 `for of` 替代. `for in` 会遍历原型链, 一是没必要的慢, 二是很多时候我们不知道原型链中有什么.\r\n\r\n现实情况可能是大家不知道这些个 for 循环都有什么区别, 尤其是被网上的一些代码带偏了. ☹️\r\n\r\n### `max-classes-per-file` 强制规定一个文件里面类的数量\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n以前 React 没有 Hooks 时经常写类, 现在前端很少写类了. 后端 Node.js 在数据操作上, 还是有类的. 每种数据一个类, 一个文件, 管理起来很方便.\r\n\r\n### `no-alert` 禁止使用 alert 等直接涉及 UI 的函数\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n虽然历史原因是全局的, 但实际这些应该是 Window 的方法. 平时基本不会这些函数. 微信小程序等也是没有这些 Web API 的. 虽然会与 UI 界面不符, 但我真的希望浏览器能把这个功能做好, 我想用. 🌞\r\n\r\n### `no-caller` 禁止匿名函数内部自调用\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n出于性能考虑, 在 ES6 之后, arguments 就是不被推荐的了. 解决方法就是给函数命名.\r\n\r\n### `no-constructor-return` 禁止构造函数的返回\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在构造函数中设置 return 是没有意义的. 如果出现, 一般都是写错了.\r\n\r\n### `no-div-regex` 避免可能与除法混淆的正则写法\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n使用引号来表示字符串, 使用 `/` 来表示正则. `/` 同时也可以表示除号, 这种一个符号两种用法在特定情况下会让人不容易理解.\r\n\r\n### `no-else-return` 不使用没必要的 else\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n梳理一下逻辑, 使用最简单有效并且可读的做法. 这个例子在我初学时对我影响很大. 初学时, 最大的疑问就是, 什么才算好代码?\r\n\r\n### `no-empty-function` 避免空函数\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n一般只有在未完成的时候才会保留空函数, 这个规则考虑到了该情况, 如果函数内有一些注释, 则不会报错.\r\n\r\n### `no-eq-null` 禁止与 null 进行非全等比较\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n不是说这个规则没用, 是因为 `eqeqeq` 规则已经做了限定.\r\n\r\n### `no-eval` 禁止将字符串当作代码执行\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n函数如其名. 这样做是非常不安全的.\r\n\r\n### `no-extend-native` 禁止扩展原生对象\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n对于大多数业务代码来说, 不要修改标准库, 任何情况下都可以找到替代方案.\r\n\r\n### `no-extra-bind` 禁止不必要的绑定 \r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n`fn.bind()` 的目的是用来在函数运行时指定 this 而不是使用当前 this, 如果函数内没有用到 this, 就没有任何意义.\r\n\r\n### `no-extra-label` 禁止使用不必要的标签\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n我们会通过 `no-labels` 来禁用标签, 所以这条规则没有使用.\r\n\r\n### `no-floating-decimal` 禁止浮点数省略 0\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n怎么说呢, 我认为这也是 JS 的语法糟粕. 不过还好, 在项目中我暂时没有遇到有人这么写代码.\r\n\r\n### `no-implicit-coercion` 禁止隐晦的类型转换\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n依然是 JS 的语法糟粕. 但类似 `'' + something` 的写法我还是见过的.\r\n\r\n### `no-implicit-globals` 禁止隐晦的全局声明\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n在 `no-var` 规则开启的时候, 这条规则失去了原有的意义. 而且现在项目都是模块化的代码, 所以没必要使用这条规则.\r\n\r\n### `no-implied-eval` 禁止使用隐性 eval\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n类似 `no-eval` 规则.\r\n\r\n### `no-invalid-this` 禁止无效的 this 引用\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n很多时候, 无效的 this 引用并不是说 this 是 undefined, 而是没必要这样去引用 this. 比如浏览器中, 全局使用 this 等同于 window, 使用 window 就好, 没必要使用 this. 还是让 this 只出现的类中吧.\r\n\r\n### `no-iterator` 禁止使用 `__iterator__` 属性\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n在 ES6 以后, 使用迭代器来替代 `__iterator__` 的功能. 禁用主要因为 `__iterator__` 并不是一个标准.\r\n\r\n### `no-labels` 禁用标签\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n我从来没有见过有人使用 label 语法, 这语法本身的含义也让我困惑. 不过还好, 我知道, 它没用, 完全可以被更简单清晰的语法替代.\r\n\r\n### `no-lone-blocks` 禁用不必要的大括号\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n大多数情况下, 应该是手误提醒. 但在我开发的经验中, 没有遇到这种情况. 不过需要注意的是, 任何大括号都会创建一个作用域, 虽然这点在特殊情况下可能会有用, 但一般都可以使用另一种写法而没必要特意创建一个作用域.\r\n\r\n### `no-loop-func`  禁止在循环中声明函数\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在循环中声明函数一般是为了将循环中的变量传入到函数中执行. 但我们不应该滥用闭包, 纯函数就能避免潜在的问题. 比如除了避免使用 var 的方法外, 我们还可以在使用 var 时这样做:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet funcs = [];\r\nlet t = v => (() => v);\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\r\n    funcs[i] = t(i);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n我不是在鼓励大家使用 var, 而是在鼓励大家写纯函数并且善用闭包而不是滥用闭包.\r\n\r\n### `no-magic-numbers` 禁止使用魔术标识符\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在这里, \"魔术\" 的意思是不知道是怎么回事儿, 但就是起作用了. 该规则主要是希望使用更良好命名的常量来规范代码. 触发该规则的大多数情况是在开发初期, 为了方便快捷而为之, 但无论如何, 良好的命名对整体工作都是有利而无害的.\r\n\r\n### `no-multi-spaces` 禁止多个空格\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n主要是代码风格上的规范. 让代码整体上可读性更好. 如果经常触发该规则, 可能是键盘的空格键坏了. 😛\r\n\r\n### `no-multi-str` 禁止多行字符串\r\n\r\n🟢使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n普通字符串的多行一般都是出错了. 如果在字符串中手动添加了换行符, 现在一般使用模板字符串来做字符串的多行, 这是一个比换行符更简单直观的办法.\r\n\r\n### `no-new` 禁止单独使用 new\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果不为赋值, 没必要使用 new. 如果构造函数中有什么想要做的, 写成纯函数更好.\r\n\r\n### `no-new-func` 禁止使用 Function\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n没必要把一个简单的事情做复杂, 尤其是 Function 的参数还有 eval 的味道.\r\n\r\n### `no-new-wrappers` 禁止在原生类型上使用 new\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在做类型转换的时候 Number 等还是比较常用的, 但需要注意的时候, 这些时候都不能在前面加 new. 为了防止意外, 这条规则还是有意义的.\r\n\r\n### `no-octal-escape` 禁止出现八进制字符转义\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在一些特殊情况下, 我们会使用字符转义. 现在基本所有编程语言都不支持八进制字符了, 均为 Unicode 或十六进制. 虽然 Unicode 会使用十六进制来表示, 但建议统一使用 Unicode, 即 `/u` 开头.\r\n\r\n### `no-param-reassign` 禁止修改函数的参数\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在我看到的代码中, 这条规则非常不容易被遵守. 有些时候从性能考虑, 我们想直接修改函数外的变量. 但其中很多时候, 我们都在冒潜在的风险, 因为我们不知道将来谁还会使用这个函数.\r\n\r\n我建议还是将此规则打开, 如果需要, 在函数处写好注释然后临时关闭该规则.\r\n\r\n### `no-proto` 禁止使用 `__proto__`\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是已被标准丢弃的用法, 但我曾多次看到互联网上有古老的代码使用了这一特性. 目前这一功能仅应该在兼容库中看到, 而我们使用的东西早已不支持 IE6, IE8 了.\r\n\r\n### `no-restricted-properties` 禁用对象某属性\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n根据需求自定义禁用任意对象的任意属性. 在庞大并且有历史的项目中, 这个功能有利于规范代码. 但新项目一般是不需要这样做.\r\n\r\n### `no-return-assign` 禁止在返回时赋值\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"error\", \"always\"]`.\r\n\r\n不仅是为了避免手误. 出于 return 语义本身的尊重, 任何赋值, 哪怕使用小括号, 都不该在 return 时出现. 多数情况下一旦返回了, 就不需要赋值. 如果真的需要, 建议写为两行, 一行赋值, 一行 return. 多占用一点空间, 更简单可读的代码.\r\n\r\n### `no-return-await` 禁止在返回时 await\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这样做是毫无意义的. 如果一个函数是异步的, 那么函数内 await 是意义是防止后面的代码先执行, 如果没有后面的代码, 就没必要 await.\r\n\r\n如果出现仅仅为了在函数末尾 catch error 的情况, 更简单的办法是:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// 不要\r\nasync function foo() {\r\n    try {\r\n        return await bar();\r\n    } catch (error) {}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 应该\r\nasync function foo() {\r\n    return await bar().catch(errorHandler);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `no-script-url`  禁用 Script URL\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n如果是前端工作, 并且是非单页应用, 才可能出现该问题.\r\n\r\n### `no-self-compare` 禁止对自身进行比较\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n比较自身, 永远是全等的. 这样的比较是没有意义的. 一般出现这样的代码是在测试或者笔误.\r\n\r\n### `no-sequences` 禁止在不必要的时候使用逗号\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n不建议在除了 for 和 while 之外的任何表达式中使用逗号, 建议仅把逗号作为分隔符使用.\r\n\r\n### `no-throw-literal` 只能抛出错误\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n首先, 直接抛出任何非 Error 都会让错误处理更复杂. 其次, 有时写抛错会手误, 比如会出现忘记写 new 的情况, 该规则能避免手误发生.\r\n\r\n### `no-unmodified-loop-condition` 避免不可预见条件变动的循环\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果循环条件不发生变化, 那么循环则不会停止, 绝大多数情况这不是我们想看到的. 我们还要避免副作用变化, 即将条件依赖放到函数副作用中, 虽然执行正常, 但会导致代码可读性差.\r\n\r\n### `no-unused-expressions` 禁止无意义的表达式\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"error\", { \"allowShortCircuit\": true }]`.\r\n\r\n为了防止笔误或者忘了将测试代码误带到产品中, 该规则有用. 但逻辑短路的用法还是比较常见, 我们不能说没有意义. 利用三元运算符做逻辑短路则不建议, 会比较难读, 可以写成函数.\r\n\r\n### `no-useless-call` 禁用不必要的 `.call` `.apply`\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n在经常涉及 this 或原型链的上下文中, 可能常用. 该规则禁止的仅是和直接使用函数没有差别的调用, 直接使用函数是效率更高也更简单的做法.\r\n\r\n同时, 尽量使用箭头函数来替代固定 this 的用法.\r\n\r\n### `no-useless-concat` 禁止不必要的字符串拼接\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果两个普通的字符串需要用加号连接, 那么它们肯定可以写成一个字符串. 如果上述情况不涉及换行, 那么我们就应该写成一个字符串.\r\n\r\n### `no-useless-return` 禁止没有必要的返回\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n一般不携带值的提前 return 都是为了阻断后续代码执行, 如果后续代码本来就是不执行的, 那么就没必要写 return. 使用该规则会让代码更简洁, 同时也让我们更清晰梳理逻辑. 触发该规则一般都是测试或者逻辑没彻底弄懂.\r\n\r\n### `no-void` 禁用 void 语法\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\nvoid 会返回 undefined, 但是 void 后面需要跟随一个任意值. undefined 就是 undefined, void any 也是 undefined. 那么更加语义化的做法就是直接使用 undefined, 避免使用 void.\r\n\r\n在 ES5 之前, void 有其历史意义. 但现在 void 已经没有必要了.\r\n\r\n### `no-warning-comments` 不使用警告注释\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"warn\", {\"location\": \"anywhere\"}]`.\r\n\r\n代码中会留存许多待办注释, 但这可能不是会需要立刻解决的, 所以我们使用了警告而非错误等级来标注出这些地方.\r\n\r\n虽然没有不是错误等级, 但该规则是非常重要的, 有利于评估项目整体情况.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-named-capture-group` 正则捕获中使用命名代替数组\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n只有 ECMAScript 2018 支持该特性. 我们也很少写正则, 所以这个因人而异吧. 但无论怎样, 有命名的可读性都是高于匿名的, 尤其是数组还有多项.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-promise-reject-errors` 限制 reject 参数只能为错误\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n和 `no-throw-literal` 规则类似, 配合使用达到最好效果.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-regex-literals` 仅在必要时使用 RegExp 构造函数\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n该规则认为 RegExp 最大的价值在于创建带参数的正则, 如果正则包含特殊字符串, 使用 RegExp 会有些啰嗦, 比如 `new RegExp(\"^\\\\d\\\\.$\")`.\r\n\r\n### `radix` 数型转换要求进制\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n将字符串转为数字类型时, 必须选择进制, 多写一个参数, 让代码更清晰.\r\n\r\n### `require-await` 禁止没有 await 的 async\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果没有使用 await, 则没有必要将函数改为 async. 如果需要将一个函数转为异步函数, 可以返回 Promise.resolve(). 如果函数没有返回, 那这个函数就不需要是一个异步函数.\r\n\r\n### `require-unicode-regexp` 强制正则使用 unicode\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n与 `no-octal-escape` 类似, 编码上统一使用 unicode 能避免意外的编码错误.\r\n\r\n### `vars-on-top`\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n为了提醒大家 var 有变量提升, 将其置于顶部是有意义的. 但如果使用了 `no-var`, 则没有必要再用该规则了.\r\n\r\n### `wrap-iife`\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"error\", \"inside\"]`.\r\n\r\nIIFE, Immediately invoked function expression, 立即执行函数表达式. 历史上之所以出现这种东西是为了避免变量作用域污染, 尤其是以前只有 var 的情况下. var 基本上只被函数限制作用域.\r\n\r\n但现在基本不会出现该情况了. 但如有历史代码, 还是建议启用该规则.\r\n\r\n### `yoda`  禁止 Yoda 语法\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n不是说这种用法出错, 是因为我们都无法跟上 Yoda 大师的思维. 我们都是普通人, 用普通的语法就好.\r\n\r\n### `strict` 严格模式\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: 在 config 文件中进行配置.\r\n\r\n```\r\nparserOptions: {\r\n  sourceType:  'module',\r\n  impliedStrict:  true,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 变量\r\n\r\n### `init-declarations` 强制变量声明规则\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果函数巨大, 那么在函数顶部提前声明是一种更好的做法. 但我们应该避免这种巨大的函数. 同时, 由于 ES6 作用域的增强, 我们没有必要提前声明可能用到了变量. 所以使用 always, 在声明的时候必须初始化是我们的首选.\r\n\r\n### `no-label-var`\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n因为使用了 `no-labels` 规则, 所以该规则没有必要了.\r\n\r\n### `no-restricted-globals` 禁用\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n根据需求自定义禁用全局变量. 避免使用某些全局变量, 与 `` 类似, 目的是处理在有历史的代码中进行结构优化.\r\n\r\n### `no-shadow` 禁止作用域变量重新声明\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n最初, 对于此规则我是有犹豫的. 在 ES6 之后, 子作用域内重新使用和外部变量一样的名称并不会导致错误, 并且可以避免一些常用的命名冲突, 比如 v, item, product. 但从可读性来说, 简单的命名并不是良好的做法, 只是在特定区域内简单的做法.\r\n\r\n### `no-undef-init` 禁止以 undefined 初始化变量\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n可能是写 TypeScript 的原因, 就算 JS 也不愿意进行重新赋值. 现在我们用 undefined 的意义主要在于判断, 我们是不会将其赋值给变量的, 更别说初始化赋值了.\r\n\r\n### `no-undefined` 禁用 undefined\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n还是基于历史原因,  以前 undefined 会被重新赋值. 现在则不会有类似问题了. 因为使用了被推荐的 [no-global-assign](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-global-assign) 和 [no-shadow-restricted-names](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-shadow-restricted-names) 规则, 则这个规则的防错意义不大了. 但逻辑梳理上, 还是有意义的. 但鉴于历史代码的原因, 我们没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n### `no-use-before-define` 禁止在定义前使用\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"error\", \"nofunc\"]`.\r\n\r\n在不使用 var 之后, 如果在声明之前使用变量, 会直接报错, 所以该规则可以避免我们出现一些低级错误.\r\n\r\n## ES6\r\n\r\n### `arrow-body-style` 箭头函数的大括号风格\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束. 箭头函数的主体有两种格式, 除了普通的大括号用法, 还有一种是省略 return 并直接返回值, 虽然这会带来额外的语法, 但鉴于这种用法的常用性, 使用该规则的默认设置.\r\n\r\n### `arrow-parens` 箭头函数的参数小括号风格\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `[\"error\", \"as-needed\"]`.\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束. 因为箭头函数经常会在回调中用, 尤其是作为 `.then()` 的参数. 这时额外加括号看起来啰嗦, 所以仅在必要时添加 .\r\n\r\n### `arrow-spacing` 箭头函数的空格风格\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束. 建议合理添加空格.\r\n\r\n### `generator-star-spacing`\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束.\r\n\r\n### `no-confusing-arrow` 禁用模糊的箭头函数返回\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果允许使用箭头函数直接返回值的特性, 那么在一些情况下可能造成可读性差, 一般我们选择通过小括号的方式增强可读性.\r\n\r\n### `no-duplicate-imports` 禁止重复引用\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n该规则和用函数增强复用是一种想法. 有利于更简洁的代码, 并且在代码变更时更容易维护.\r\n\r\n### [7.0] [no-restricted-exports](https://eslint.org/docs/7.0.0/rules/no-restricted-exports) 限制可以被导出的变量名\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n自定义.\r\n\r\n### [no-restricted-imports](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-imports) 限制可以被 import 导入的\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n自定义.\r\n\r\n### [no-useless-computed-key](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-useless-computed-key) 禁止没有必要的对象 key 计算\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n如果不是变量, 没有必要使用中括号. 如 `{ [key]: 'keyName' }` 则是必要的.\r\n\r\n### [no-useless-constructor](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-useless-constructor) 避免无效的 constructor\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n触发该规则一般是测试或手误. 如果真的在 constructor 中没有代码, 则这个类的意义就不大, 完全可以用普通函数替代.\r\n\r\n### [no-useless-rename](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-useless-rename) 禁用没有意义的重命名\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\nES6 之后导出导入及解构时可以直接为变量重命名, 将 a 重命名为 a 是没有任何意义的. 为了避免没有意义的命名, 使用该规则.\r\n\r\n### [no-var](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var) 禁用 var\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n该规则的好处之前已经说过了, 使用 const, let 替换 var 来避免变量提升, 限制在作用域中.\r\n\r\n### `object-shorthand` [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand) 简写 object 的属性\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束. 跟随团队习惯选择.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-arrow-callback` [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-arrow-callback) 回调要求使用箭头函数\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n箭头函数除了设置 this 之外, 最大的作用就是简化回调的匿名函数. 使用该规则能让统一风格.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-const` 尽量使用 const [文档](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\nES6 之后区分了 let, const, 但 const 并不是只用于常量, 而是只限制不能直接重新赋值. 完全使用 let 并不会出错, 但在声明的时候严格区分使用可以让代码可读性更强.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-destructuring` 尽量使用解构 [文档](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-destructuring)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n为了一致化代码风格, 使用该规则. 有些人喜欢用, 另一些人可能还是喜欢经典的方法, 导致代码内风格比较混乱. 解构是更简单的, 并且在一些情况下表达能力更强.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-numeric-literals` 尽量使用字面量进行数型转换  [文档](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-numeric-literals)\r\n\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n在 ES6 中, 允许直接做常用的二进制, 八进制, 十六进制的转换. 但我认为使用 `radix` 规则更好. 所以没有使用该规则.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-rest-params` 尽量使用解构代替 arguments [文档](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-rest-params)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n建议尽量不要使用 arguments. 以前是不得已, 没有很少的替代方案. 可读性上来说, 尽量避免函数使用外部变量, 也不要使用 arguments 这种特殊变量.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-spread` 尽量使用解构代替 .apply() [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-spread)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n与 `no-useless-call` 的原因类似, 尽量避免这种用法. 性能, 可读性都不占优.\r\n\r\n### `prefer-template` 尽量使用字符串模板字面量 [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-template)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n以前, 字符串拼接的时候引号和加号的使用看上去比较乱, 遇到复杂的情况, 如果没有语法着色, 很难看懂. 模板字符串很好解决了以前的语法不足.\r\n\r\n### `rest-spread-spacing` 强制 rest, spread 语法的空格 [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/rest-spread-spacing)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束.\r\n\r\n### `sort-imports` 引用排序 [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/sort-imports)\r\n\r\n🔵 可选使用该规则.\r\n\r\n排序是一个良好的做法, 但有些时候需要按照特定需求排序. 比如在 JSX 文件中, 一般都最上面引用 React. 可以根据需求使用该规则.\r\n\r\n### `symbol-description` 要求 symbol 描述 [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/symbol-description)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n与函数尽量命名类似. 尽量增加描述让代码容易被理解.\r\n\r\n### `template-curly-spacing` [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/template-curly-spacing)\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则: `error`.\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束.\r\n\r\n### `yield-star-spacing` [doc](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/yield-star-spacing)\r\n\r\n这是一个风格约束.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 附录\r\n\r\n关于如何添加空格:\r\n\r\n- 句号, 逗号之后添加空格.\r\n- 大括号两侧添加空格.\r\n- 中括号, 小括号, 引号, 重音符号外留空格, 内无空格.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n图例:\r\n\r\n🟢 使用该规则.\r\n🟡 没有使用该规则.\r\n🔵 业务代码基本不会触发该规则, 选择性使用.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zsqk/zsqk/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zsqk/zsqk/issues/120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3527530768,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MzUyNzUzMDc2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3527530768","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-09T00:47:54Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3527530816,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1Mjc1MzA4MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/events/3527530816","actor":{"login":"eslint-deprecated[bot]","id":29966797,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjk5NjY3OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/3565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/eslint-deprecated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eslint-deprecated%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-09T00:47:55Z","label":{"name":"archived
