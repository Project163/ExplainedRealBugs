that's a pretty big breaking change. I can't believe that was accepted in a minor release. I've verified the suggestion works, so I don't have a problem updating my configuration. But I still don't see why the original configuration cannot work. The documentation seems to suggest it will still work: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle So this is either a bug or a semantic versioning mishap. (Just so it's clear, I'm not upset. I'm just pointing out that others might be).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/comments/549003301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mojavelinux","id":79351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux","html_url":"https://github.com/mojavelinux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mojavelinux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
