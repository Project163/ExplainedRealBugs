My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features).\r\n2. I know what part of my animation doesn't work.\r\n3. I have created a simplified version of my animation \r\n4. I have attached the AEP file (as a zip file so it can be attached) that only has the part of the animation that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nThe repeat count is not taken into account if we start the animation when the LottieAnimationView is not visible\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?**\r\n3.3.1\r\n\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\nAndroid 9.0\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. create LottieAnimationView\r\n2. hide the view\r\n3. set repeatCount at 2 (or more) \r\n4. start playAnimation()\r\n5. show the view\r\n6. the animation is played only once\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n```\r\n    fun playAnimation() {\r\n        if(lottie_view.isShown) {\r\n            lottie_view.repeatCount = 2\r\n            lottie_view.playAnimation()\r\n            // HERE Animation will be trigger three times\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            lottie_view.repeatCount = 2\r\n            lottie_view.playAnimation()\r\n            // HERE The animation is not played immediately, it will be played\r\n            // only when the view is visible, but however it will be played only\r\n            // once instead of the 3 times desired\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Lottie is supported and developed on nights and weekends.
