Issues from [Lottie sponsors](https://github.com/users/gpeal/sponsorship) will be prioritized.*\r\n\r\n\r\n**If you don't use this template, your issue will be closed. Delete this text once completed.**\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nYou are currently using the official compose-bom version. This version allows the implementation of some unwanted libraries. For example, the material2 library should be migrated to material3. Even though you are not using material 2 in the lottie compose library, due to compose-bom, we see the material library in the dependency tree. This means we have to implement an extra library while using lottie compose. Current dependency tree:\r\n\r\n+--- com.airbnb.android:lottie-compose:6.3.0\r\n|    +--- androidx.compose:compose-bom:{require 2023.08.00; reject _} -> 2023.08.00\r\n|    |    +--- androidx.compose.foundation:foundation:1.5.0 -> 1.6.0-rc01 (c)\r\n|    |    +--- androidx.compose.foundation:foundation-android:1.5.0 -> 1.6.0-rc01 (c)\r\n|    |    +--- androidx.compose.material:material:1.5.0 -> 1.6.0-rc01 (c)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIf you use compose alpha edition (current version : 2024.02.00-alpha02) problem will fixed. [Compose bom library chrisbanes](https://github.com/chrisbanes/compose-bom)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe only alternative solution I can think of for this is not to import the unused dependencies using `exclude` function in gradle for compose-bom library. However, this solution seems a bit hacky.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNo additional context. Thanks for developing this awesome library.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
