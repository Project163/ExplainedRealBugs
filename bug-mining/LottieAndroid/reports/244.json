Please describe.**\r\nI have a `Composable` that will iterate continuously by using `LottieConstants.IterateForever`. I would like to be able to test it but as [Compose Testing codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-testing#5) suggests, there might be a need for special animation API like `InfiniteTransition`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn Compose, the animation APIs were designed with testability in mind, so the problem can be fixed by using the correct API. Instead of restarting the animateDpAsState animation, we can use infinite animations.\r\n\r\nInfinite animations are a special case that Compose tests understand so they're not going to keep the test busy.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTo find a way (new API method in Lottie?) to test infinite Compose Lottie animations.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI haven't found a way to combine existing Lottie API along with InfiniteTransition API.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWhen I'm using Lottie's standard API, I'm currently receiving same error message as defined in codelab linked above: `Idling resource timed out: possibly due to compose being busy.`\r\n\r\nAny input would be appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1907/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
