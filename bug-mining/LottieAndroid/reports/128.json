They are not supported but will be treated like add masks.\" keeps on appearing, and I found the information that android OS doesn't support the intersect masks unlike iOS so I try to avoid the \"intersect masks\" as possible by separating the same logo layers with masks into 2 like the screen capture above (I changed the color of the eclipse mask to make it recognizable). \r\nSo, as far as I can see, there is no intersect mask here, as it looks the same but each of the masks are divided.\r\nBUT THAT WARNING MESSAGE STILL APPPEARS!\r\nIs there no way to work with it besides: \r\ndraw them frame by frame back again from the illustrator->get the shapes at the After Effects->attach the shapes frame by frames again and so on, just for the loading icon ??\r\n\r\nThe loading icon should be like this:\r\n![loading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21138364/40467367-9900de98-5f64-11e8-91a8-c38d421bf413.gif)\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/784/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
