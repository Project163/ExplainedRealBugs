This is a regression from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and I believe is caused by commit a483b7695e.\r\n\r\nEssentially, when `onBindViewHolder()` is first called, the view is not attached to the window yet. With this change, the animation will not start but will set the `wasAnimatingWhenNotShown` flag to true. However, in `onAttachedToWindow()`, both the `autoPlay` and `wasAnimatingWhenNotShown` flags are checked to decide whether or not to play the animation. If the `lottie_autoPlay` attribute was not set in XML, then the animation will never start playback unless the `playAnimation()` call is deferred to after `onAttachedToWindow()`. \r\n\r\nI've attached a simple sample project here ([LottieBug.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/3237744/LottieBug.zip)) that reproduces the issue, but it can be reproduced as simply as the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\r\n  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\r\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\r\n    \r\n    setContentView(\r\n      RecyclerView(this).apply {\r\n        layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this@MainActivity, LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL, false)\r\n        adapter = object : RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerView.ViewHolder>() {\r\n          override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\r\n            return object : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(LottieAnimationView(parent.context)) {}\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          override fun getItemCount(): Int = 1\r\n\r\n          override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: RecyclerView.ViewHolder, position: Int) {\r\n            (holder.itemView as LottieAnimationView).apply {\r\n              loop(true)\r\n              setAnimation(\"lottie.json\")\r\n              playAnimation()\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
