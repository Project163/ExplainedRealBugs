If this is executed in a loop, we can see a significant amount of allocations in a short period of time. Calling Paint.setAlpha() generates a ColorSpace which calls Named.values() where Named is an Enum. This was modified in Android 30.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Start the issue-repro app\r\n2. Go to Profiler\r\n3. Select the Memory profiler\r\n4. Start Java/Kotlin allocation recording\r\n5. After a few seconds you will see a huge amount of ColorSpace$Named[] allocations.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2294911/137969441-0518c664-fb96-4f87-a309-0cdb92e0e625.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2294911/137969501-f7b85baf-c84e-4b0d-9ac8-9ed96479d651.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
