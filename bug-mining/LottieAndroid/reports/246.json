The lottie JSON defines width/height to 1000/1000px as well as original size of the images is 1000x1000x. We download these images before hand and then create bitmaps and load them through `updateBitmap` method. This works however each image loaded takes 4MB of memory and displayed lottie width is ie. 300x300. When I rescale the bitmaps to 300x300 before loading them into LottieAnimationView then the resulting image is even more shrinked within LottieAnimationView... it basically looks like it is 1/3 of the view. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I shrink these bitmaps if I don't even display them in its original resolution which is 1000x1000 so I can reduce the memory footprint?**\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-17 at 2 49 04 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5558923/146541389-c5d77ea4-5a3b-4541-b3b0-caf893be8c25.png\">\r\n<img width=\"332\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-17 at 3 54 51 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5558923/146541397-12372ed7-7be2-46d5-bf27-5cf51d41bb96.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1968/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
