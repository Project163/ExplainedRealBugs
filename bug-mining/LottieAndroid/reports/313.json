Open the app, the `heart` animation should start playing.\r\n2. Click the `heart`, it should changes to app logo with no animation.\r\n3. Click the logo, there is no change in the UI of version 6.3.0. Version 6.2.0 displays the \"heart\" animation and starts playing.\r\n\r\n**What I want to know**\r\n1. Is this an intented behavior?\r\n2.
