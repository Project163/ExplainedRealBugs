Actually, this PR was what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nOf course, migrating user data is possible, but it is more error prone than just supporting detecting the format using magic bytes or specifying the type explicitly. As a workaround, I can copy the `LottieAnimation` and `rememberLottieComposition` functions and force the type myself in case you prefer not implementing it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/comments/2041326358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MSDarwish2000","id":20906401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTA2NDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20906401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000","html_url":"https://github.com/MSDarwish2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MSDarwish2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-29T07:06:02Z","updated_at":"2024-09-29T07:06:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2558","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2558/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2558/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2558/events","html_url":"https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/2558","id":2554749812,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBC8mW859BIl9","number":2558,"title":"Unify
