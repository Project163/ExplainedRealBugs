My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features).\r\n2. I know what part of my animation doesn't work.\r\n3. I have created a simplified version of my animation \r\n4. I have attached the AEP file (as a zip file so it can be attached) that only has the part of the animation that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nUsing @Composable LottieAnimation leads to a crash:\r\n`java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No virtual method setImageAssetManager(Lcom/airbnb/lottie/manager/ImageAssetManager;)V in class Lcom/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable; or its super classes (declaration of 'com.airbnb.lottie.LottieDrawable' appears in /data/app/~~rC9ACFpKIQB3QFZSSWzMHA==/app.package-KUTAny4ZZcykm71TfCtL4w==/base.apk)\r\n        at com.airbnb.lottie.ImageAssetDelegateSetterKt.setImageAssetManager(ImageAssetDelegateSetter.kt:10)\r\n        at com.airbnb.lottie.compose.LottieAnimationKt$LottieAnimation$3.invoke(LottieAnimation.kt:120)\r\n        at com.airbnb.lottie.compose.LottieAnimationKt$LottieAnimation$3.invoke(LottieAnimation.kt:106)`\r\n\r\nBecause LottieDrawable does not have the method setImageAssetManager, and ImageAssetDelegateSetter tries to call this method on LottieDrawable, but instead it's just recursive, as showed by the IDE.\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?**\r\nlottie-android 3.7.1-SNAPSHOT and 3.7.0\r\nlottie-compose 1.0.0-beta09-1-SNAPSHOT and 1.0.0-beta07-1\r\n\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\nAndroid 12 on Pixel 4a\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. have a @Composable function\r\n2. use LottieAnimation @Composable, passing LottieComposition and progress taken from animateLottieCompositionAsState\r\n3. LottieCompositionSpec is RawRes\r\n4. run, it crashes with NoSuchMethodError when rendering","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1837/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
