Most notably, when I apply any easing along the Y axis it is ignored. JSON files and AE file are here:\r\n[RectangleSize.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/773195/RectangleSize.zip)\r\n\r\nFYI Heres a breakdown of the files that look different\r\n01 through 03 all look right.\r\nRect_Size_04_YsideonlyEased - it is different. It doesn't look like its easing. It looks like just linear keyframes\r\nRect_Size_05_XsideonlyEased - this one looks fine\r\nRect_Size_06_XandY - this one is different too. It looks like its eased when it expands on the X axis, but NOT when it expands up on the Y axis. When it contracts back down on both axises it looks correct. So just like version 04, something about scaling on the Y axis. It is ignoring the easing\r\nRect_Size_07_XandY_WithPosition - this one looks different. When it scales to the right, it looks right. but when it scales up the bottom edge moves, when its supposed to stay in the same place. I think fixing the Y axis easing should fix this\r\nRect_Size_08_XandY_WithPositionParented - Same issues with the edges. I think fixing the Y\r\nRect_Size_09_XandY_Path - this one i didnt actually use a Rectangle, I used a path instead and it looks fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
