Issues from [Lottie sponsors](https://github.com/users/gpeal/sponsorship) will be prioritized.*\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\n1. My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features).\r\n2. I know what part of my animation doesn't work.\r\n3. I have created a simplified version of my animation \r\n4. I have attached the AEP file (as a zip file so it can be attached) that only has the part of the animation that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI have an animation that has base64 images with rounded corners.  Here is what the animation should look like: https://app.lottiefiles.com/share/5d20e06b-8f34-4009-8643-231ee173c447. It displays fine on LottieFiles and in iOS, but on Android I get a few `JsonDataExceptions` always for the same field.\r\n\r\nIn `LayerParser.java` on line 239 the parser only accepts an int, but in my animation (json attached) these fields are floating point values.  I was going to attempt a PR, but the `preCompWidth` is eventually used in a `Rect()` which needs an integer, and I am not familiar enough with the Lottie rendering pipeline to think of a good solution...\r\n[problem_animation.json.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/9436147/problem_animation.json.zip)\r\n\r\nWhen I round these values to integers, the images in my animation appear as below, in the screenshot section.\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?**\r\n 5.2.0 and 5.2.1-SNAPSHOT (lottie-compose)\r\n\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\nAndroid 13 Emulator\r\nCompose 1.2.1\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Try to load composition of attached json file\r\n2. Get error `Error is com.airbnb.lottie.parser.moshi.JsonDataException: Expected an int but was 25.7358 at path $.assets[9].layers[0].w`\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"206\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-08-26 at 22 09 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17356172/186983549-2754bd9d-d02a-4770-8e87-80ed7a6da9ab.png\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
