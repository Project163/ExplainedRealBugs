Issues from [Lottie sponsors](https://github.com/users/gpeal/sponsorship) will be prioritized.*\r\n\r\n**If you don't use this template, your issue will be closed. Delete this text once completed.**\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\n1. My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features).\r\n2. I know what part of my animation doesn't work.\r\n3. I have created a simplified version of my animation \r\n4. I have attached the AEP file (as a zip file so it can be attached) that only has the part of the animation that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nAs attached [anim_video_extract.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/5514331/anim_video_extract.zip), the lottie file is rendered perfectly on most of our test devices, however, is rendered fragmentary on a few test devices, such as OPPO OPPO R9sk Android 6.0.1, API 23, Motorola XT1650 Android 8.0.0, API 26.\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?**\r\n3.5.0\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\n6.0.1,8.0.0\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n1. I use this lottie in xml like this:\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\r\n<layout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\r\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\">\r\n\r\n    <data>\r\n\r\n    </data>\r\n\r\n    <LinearLayout\r\n        android:id=\"@+id/container\"\r\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\r\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\r\n        android:orientation=\"vertical\"\r\n        android:background=\"@drawable/common_background\">\r\n        <com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView\r\n            android:id=\"@+id/lottie_animation_view\"\r\n            android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\r\n            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\r\n            android:layout_gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\r\n            app:lottie_autoPlay=\"true\"\r\n            app:lottie_loop=\"true\"\r\n            app:lottie_rawRes=\"@raw/anim_video_extract\" />\r\n    </LinearLayout>\r\n</layout>\r\n```\r\nThen, I inflate this xml into an empty activity. \r\nThese are all my app's codes.\r\n2. Install the apk on my test device;\r\n3. Start my app, then the bug happens.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nExpected result:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-11-10 10-40-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19379538/98620940-37be5900-2341-11eb-9c0d-e2b846a7c08f.png)\r\nActual result:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-11-10 10-18-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19379538/98619415-2758af00-233e-11eb-924a-d5d2e6ed92c3.png)","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
