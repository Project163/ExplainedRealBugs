Please describe.**\r\nI'd like to use a Lottie animation as a placeholder for images loaded via Coil, which only directly supports Painters\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn implementation of `Painter` which has the same constructor parameters as the `LottieAnimation` composable. I believe that since most of the logic is inside of the Canvas `onDraw`, it would be straight-forward to move into a Painter's `onDraw`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCoil also allows for manual state management, which you could use to add and remove `LottieAnimation` to the composition. We currently do this, but it's not exactly intuitive.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCoil similarly has their API support both a Painter (`rememberAsyncImagePainter`) and a composable (`AsyncImage`), both of which are handy in different situations.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2193/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
