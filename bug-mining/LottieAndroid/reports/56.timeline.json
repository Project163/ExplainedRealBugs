I could also reproduce it on an LG G3.\r\n\r\nUpon resuming, `playAnimation(true)` will be called (on LottieDrawable).\r\nThere we have the following code:\r\n```\r\nif (setStartTime) {\r\n  animator.setCurrentPlayTime((long) (progress * animator.getDuration()));\r\n}\r\nanimator.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitching the order of these instructions would potentially fix the problem. However, the `AnimatorUpdateListener` is called with `0.0f` as soon as we call `animator.start()`, which happens before we set the current play time.\r\n\r\n```\r\nanimator.addUpdateListener(new ValueAnimator.AnimatorUpdateListener() {\r\n      @Override public void onAnimationUpdate(ValueAnimator animation) {\r\n        if (systemAnimationsAreDisabled) {\r\n          animator.cancel();\r\n          setProgress(1f);\r\n        } else {\r\n      ----> setProgress((float) animation.getAnimatedValue());\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will set the progress and when the `setCurrentPlayTime` finally runs, the progress will already be at `0.0f`.\r\n\r\nIn my app, I fixed the problem by saving the progress before calling resume and setting it myself.\r\n```\r\n    void resumeAnimation() {\r\n        float progress = animationView.getProgress();\r\n        animationView.resumeAnimation();\r\n\r\n        ValueAnimator animator = getAnimator();\r\n        if (animator != null) {\r\n            animator.setCurrentPlayTime((long) (progress * animator.getDuration()));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not ideal as `getAnimator()` uses reflection.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/comments/304617220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kakai248","id":4193601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTM2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4193601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248","html_url":"https://github.com/kakai248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kakai248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1101341855,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTEwMTM0MTg1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/events/1101341855","actor":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"14bb09fd9b39c31cae5418328ff14d6f8915f913","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/commits/14bb09fd9b39c31cae5418328ff14d6f8915f913","created_at":"2017-05-29T19:08:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/comments/327919738","html_url":"https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/310#issuecomment-327919738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/310","id":327919738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzkxOTczOA==","user":{"login":"CCorrado","id":8997932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8997932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado","html_url":"https://github.com/CCorrado","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CCorrado/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-07T20:33:04Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T20:33:04Z","body":"We
