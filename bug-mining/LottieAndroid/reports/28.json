But there are few drawbacks, which can affect behavior of some non-Lottie drawables inside it:\r\n\r\n1. `LottieAnimationView` overrides `invalidateDrawable()` without making calls to super, so some Drawables that are relying on calls to this methods will be broken.\r\n1. `LottieAnimationView` handles its own internal `Drawable` instance, and it's not propagated back to parent class\r\n1. There are no animation cleanup methods called when we're changing drawable through `setImageDrawable()` or any other `ImageView` methods — and no exception is raised if we're misusing these methods.\r\n1. `LottieAnimationView` is forced to have software layer, while in some usecases it can affect performance and memory consumption.\r\n\r\nAre there any plans to improve `LottieAnimationView` behavior as an `ImageView` or are you willing to accept PRs resolving these issues?","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
