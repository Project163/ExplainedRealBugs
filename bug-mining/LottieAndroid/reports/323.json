Issues from [Lottie sponsors](https://github.com/users/gpeal/sponsorship) will be prioritized.*\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nYou have done great work, adding support for G-zipped animations, but this feature depends on file extension for content providers and file sources. This is good for most cases, but in some cases when dealing with data without extensions from external sources or pre-existing data where migration is hard, an alternative method may be needed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nOne solution that won't introduce breaking changes would be using `isGzipCompressed` and `isZipCompressed` which are already present in the codebase and used by `RawRes` and `Asset`. I think it is a better and foolproof detection method but may need early file probing. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAnother method could be adding optional argument to each `LottieCompositionSpec` (except `JsonString` of course), which allows users to explicitly specify the animation type.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
