The value override callback is never called by Lottie.\r\n```Kotlin\r\n        lottieAnimationView.addValueCallback(someKeyPath, LottieProperty.TRANSFORM_POSITION) { value ->\r\n            PointF(100F, 200F)\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging, it looks like the bug is in `SplitDimensionPathKeyframeAnimation`. This appears to be used to animate positions but ignores value callbacks entirely. Below is a screenshot of a debugger output showing that there is a value callback set correctly on the animation object.\r\n<img width=\"1195\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-08 at 5 35 06 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1526881/95528351-b4e65f00-098c-11eb-8248-6a15eff6198f.png\">\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/ae030bb5aa76b35901411c00ac384081e1d88510/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/animation/keyframe/SplitDimensionPathKeyframeAnimation.java#L25-L40\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Clone sample project.\r\n2. Build and install. Animation with a moving ball and line should loop.\r\n3. Based on the value callback, the ball should have an overridden position that is static.\r\n\r\n![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1526881/95528508-28886c00-098d-11eb-9e2e-0de38b87061e.gif)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
