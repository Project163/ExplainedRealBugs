Please describe.**\r\nWhile trying to figure out why it seemed as though our use of the LottieAnimation composable was misbehaving, I realized that the `clipToCompositionBounds` parameter does not refer to `Jetpack Compose`'s composition, but the Lottie animation composition. While the fact that the parameter to specify the animation is `composition`, the docs don't make the use of referencing that parameter (which would help clarify it's not `Jetpack Compose`'s composition), the `clip` portion of the name is also misleading because in some circumstances this means that the Lottie will be rendered outside of the containers bounds, which means that in such circumstances, the parameter being `true` means the lottie will be larger than when the value is set to `false`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI propose that the parameter documentation is improved (so that the `composition` text refers to the `composition` parameter) and that `clip` be swapped for `expand` (or the behavior inverted, such that when `clip` is true, the results will be smaller than with `false`, though I feel as though `expand` is the better approach here)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI can obviously write my own wrapper functions, but I'm sure I won't be the first to be confused by the fact that `clip == true` can mean the Lottie draws outside of the container bounds.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
