I am listening to onAnimationEnd() and onAnimationCancel() using AnimatorListenerAdapter. When animation is cancelled while being played using `cancelAnimation()`, I get `onAnimationCancel()` callback correctly but not getting `onAnimationEnd()` callback. In case on `ValueAnimator` we get `onAnimationCancel()` followed by `onAnimationEnd()`. But looks like LottieValueAnimator overrides `cancel()` and doesn't forward onAnimationEnd() . Is this intentional or a bug?\r\n````\r\nanimationView.addAnimatorListener(object : AnimatorListenerAdapter() {\r\n            override fun onAnimationStart(animation: Animator?) {\r\n                Timber.d(\">>>>>>> animation start\")\r\n                animationListener?.onAnimationStart()\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            override fun onAnimationEnd(animation: Animator?) {\r\n                Timber.d(\" animation end\")\r\n                animationListener?.onAnimationEnd()\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            override fun onAnimationCancel(animation: Animator?) {\r\n                Timber.d(\"animation cancel\")\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        })\r\nanimationView.playAnimation()\r\ncontainer.postDelayed({\r\n       animationView.cancelAnimation()\r\n}, 1000L) \r\n````\r\n\r\n1. Add LottiAnimationView in xml.\r\n2. Set lottie json.\r\n3. set animation listener to listen onAnimationEnd() and onAnimationCancel()\r\n4. play the animation\r\n5. Cancel the animation before it finishes.","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
