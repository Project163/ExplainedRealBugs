My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features). ✅\r\n2. I know what part of my animation doesn't work. ✅\r\n3. I have created a simplified version of my animation ✅\r\n4. I have attached the AEP file (as a zip file so it can be attached) that only has the part of the animation that doesn't work. ✅\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nParent opacity not propagated to TextLayer.\r\nThe problem is `parentAlpha` not calculated into TextLayer's alpha: `int alpha = opacity * 255 / 100;`\r\nSolution: `int alpha = (int) ((parentAlpha / 255f * (float) opacity / 100f) * 255);` like in BaseLayer (tested & working)\r\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/master/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/model/layer/TextLayer.java#L159\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?**\r\nI found this issue in Dart version of Lottie what is an unofficial conversion of lottie-android. I tested it with the Lottie Android app, where the bug also appeared so I thought it is an \"original bug\"\r\n\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\nAndroid 31\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nPut text into a parent layer and add opacity animation to this parent layer\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Files**\r\n[opacity_sample.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/11763345/opacity_sample.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
