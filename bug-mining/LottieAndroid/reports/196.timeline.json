#1523, with an enhancement.\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n\r\nThe issue was that the `defStyleAttr` would not be respected - the following class would compile, but `R.attr.heartViewStyle` would be ignored:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass HeartView(context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet)\r\n    : LottieAnimationView(context, attrs, R.attr.heartViewStyle)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis meant that if we had a style:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<style name=\"Widget.LottieSample.HeartView\">\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_autoPlay\">true</item>\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_loop\">true</item>\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_url\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbnb/lottie-android/master/LottieSample/src/main/res/raw/heart.json</item>\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe'd need to apply it explicitly in the layout each time we used it to a `LottieAnimationView` (or `HeartView`, but at this stage, there's no need for `HeartView` to exist - it doesn't do anything):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView\r\n    style=\"@style/Widget.LottieSample.HeartView\"\r\n    android:layout_width=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_height=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solving the issue\r\n\r\nAfter delegating `defStyleAttr` to the `init` function, and passing it to the `context.obtainedStyledAttributes` call, we're able to do this (note, there's no explicit style on this view):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<com.airbnb.lottie.samples.HeartView\r\n    android:layout_width=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_height=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nas long as we set the `heartViewStyle` attribute in our application theme:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<style name=\"Theme.LottieSample\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\r\n    ...\r\n    <item name=\"heartViewStyle\">@style/Widget.LottieSample.HeartView</item>\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style name=\"Widget.LottieSample.HeartView\">\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_autoPlay\">true</item>\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_loop\">true</item>\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_url\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbnb/lottie-android/master/LottieSample/src/main/res/raw/heart.json</item>\r\n</style>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nso every time we use `HeartView`, it'll use the correct style by default, across the app.\r\n\r\n### Enhancing our solution\r\n\r\nThe addition that isn't covered in the original issue is adding a default style attribute for `LottieAnimationView` in the library, `R.attr.lottieAnimationViewStyle`.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to set default Lottie attributes across our app, for example the `autoPlay` and `loop` properties:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<style name=\"Theme.LottieSample\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\r\n    ...\r\n    <item name=\"lottieAnimationViewStyle\">@style/Widget.LottieSample.LottieAnimationView</item>\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style name=\"Widget.LottieSample.LottieAnimationView\" parent=\"android:Widget\">\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_autoPlay\">true</item>\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_loop\">true</item>\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nsuch that in our layouts, we'd only need to specify the url, and **we wouldn't _need_ to use a custom view to do it**:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView\r\n    android:layout_width=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_height=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\r\n    app:lottie_url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbnb/lottie-android/master/LottieSample/src/main/res/raw/lottielogo.json\" />\r\n\r\n<com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView\r\n    android:layout_width=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_height=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\r\n    app:lottie_url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbnb/lottie-android/master/LottieSample/src/main/res/raw/heart.json\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n**We can still override these properties in our layouts, if the default isn't suitable for all cases**. And this is what the above looks like:\r\n\r\n![lottie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2678555/75442321-22420400-5957-11ea-8cb8-a9dbb7ed549b.gif)\r\n\r\nThis solution works alongside any custom views too - so if you want a `HeartView` (or a `LoadingIndicatorView`) where you don't have to specify _any_ Lottie attributes - but most of the time, it's ok to use the vanilla `LottieAnimationView` because you're not reusing that particular icon, you can (the GIF looks the same with this layout and theme setup):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView\r\n    android:layout_width=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_height=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\r\n    app:lottie_url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbnb/lottie-android/master/LottieSample/src/main/res/raw/lottielogo.json\" />\r\n\r\n<com.airbnb.lottie.samples.HeartView\r\n    android:layout_width=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_height=\"256dp\"\r\n    android:layout_gravity=\"center\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere we've refactored `Widget.LottieSample.Heart` to extend from our default `Widget.LottieSample.LottieAnimationView` style, so that it also has the `autoPlay` and `loop` properties:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<style name=\"Theme.LottieSample\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar\">\r\n    ...\r\n    <item name=\"lottieAnimationViewStyle\">@style/Widget.LottieSample.LottieAnimationView</item>\r\n    <item name=\"heartViewStyle\">@style/Widget.LottieSample.LottieAnimationView.HeartView</item>\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style name=\"Widget.LottieSample.LottieAnimationView\" parent=\"android:Widget\">\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_autoPlay\">true</item>\r\n    <item name=\"lottie_loop\">true</item>\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<style name=\"Widget.LottieSample.LottieAnimationView.HeartView\">\r\n    <!-- inherits autoPlay and loop from the parent style -->\r\n    <item
