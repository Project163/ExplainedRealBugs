I need to display it in a scrollable column. The animation should fill the screen width and i expect the height to be calculated in the correct ratio. Actually, the animation is displayed correctly, but takes a height equal to the height specified in the json file.\r\nThe reason for this is probably that the Canvas in the LottieAnimation component uses `composition.bounds.height()` and `composition.bounds.width()` without any calculation depending on the allowed max width.\r\n```\r\nCanvas(\r\n  modifier = modifier\r\n    .size((composition.bounds.width() / dpScale).dp, (composition.bounds.height() / dpScale).dp)\r\n) {\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add a raw animation json resource with a size larger than the screen size\r\n2. Create a `Column` with `verticalScroll` modifier\r\n3. Put a `LottieAnimation` component with `ContentScale.FillWidth` on the created column\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28695957/225307827-ac482bd8-dce3-443c-a13f-4ff786d7877c.jpg\" width=\"350px\">\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28695957/225307871-36ee095e-00b2-433f-b5b7-172bc85808a5.jpg\" width=\"350px\">\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
