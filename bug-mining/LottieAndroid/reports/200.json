This is because the custom/null cache key is ignored here: https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/master/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieCompositionFactory.java#L219. It should be calling `fromRawResSync(context, rawRes, cacheKey);` instead.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this was missed in https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/commit/ee942249214dd6bb1540b746ca0b678a6382b5ee\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Set `cacheComposition` to `false` on `LottieAnimationView`\r\n2. Attach a debugger and set a breakpoint in `LottieCompositionCache.put`\r\n3. Load an animation from a raw res\r\n4. See that `cacheKey` is non-null, even though it should be null.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
