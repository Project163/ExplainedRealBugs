Issues from [Lottie sponsors](https://github.com/users/gpeal/sponsorship) will be prioritized.*\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nUsing lottie for Android 3.4.4, I'm trying to play a sound in sync with an animation. But I didn't find a reliable way to detect when the animation pause/resume, as the `LottieAnimationView` does not provide callback on these actions.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAndroid provide an `Animator.AnimatorPauseListener` interface alongside `Animator.AnimatorListener`.\r\n\r\n`LottieAnimationView` API already supports `Animator.AnimatorListener`, but it does not supports `Animator.AnimatorPauseListener`\r\n\r\nSupporting this kind of listener would be a natural extension of the `LottieAnimationView` API.\r\n\r\n`LottieAnimationView.addAnimatorPauseListener()`\r\n`LottieAnimationView.removeAnimatorPauseListener()`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nActually, I'm subclassing LottieAnimationView to generate and dispatch pause/resume events when pauseAnimation()/resumeAnimation() is invoked, but it does not allow me to reuse the `Animator.AnimatorPauseListener` interface as I don't have access to the `ValueAnimator` that should be passed to the callback, and it would be better if implemented directly on the underlying drawable.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1644/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
