Please describe.**\n\nWhen running Paparazzi-based snapshot tests on the JVM we have to set `LottieTask.EXECUTOR` to a direct executor. This requires that every test class whose test functions interact with Lottie perform this act _somewhere_, be it a `@Before`, `@BeforeClass`, a `@Rule`, or static block.\n\nIf _every_ test does not do this, running a subset of tests can fail as no one has changed the value yet.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nI would like the static initializer to check a system property and conditionally set a direct executor itself. This would allow us to set a system property on the entire `Test` task which would globally control this behavior for all tests regardless of the order or subset that is run.\n\nSomething like\n```java\n  public static Executor EXECUTOR;\n  static {\n    if (\"true\".equals(System.getProperty(\"lottie.testing.directExecutor\"))) {\n      EXECUTOR = Runnable::run;\n    } else {\n      EXECUTOR = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(new LottieThreadFactory());\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Custom JUnit runner to set the value. While this works on Android unit tests executed under instrumentation, Gradle does not allow overriding the runner for JVM-based unit tests.\n- Switching to a different test framework. Seems unreasable to port thousands of tests just to get a hook into initialization before the tests run.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
