Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]\r\nWe have a use case, where the colors of gradient must be changed multiple times after an animation has been started. Simply replacing the value callback doesn't help, as GradientFillContent hashes internally a LinearGradient object. This hashed object is not removed from the hash, when we replace the callback and change the colors.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSetting a new value callback for a gradient should replace the existing gradient.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMy current workaround is: \r\n* Call clearComposition() on LottieDrawable\r\n* Set the new value callback\r\n* Call setComposition(..) on LottieDrawable with the existing LottieComposition","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1608/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
