My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features).\r\n2. I know what part of my animation doesn't work.\r\n3. I have created a simplified version of my animation \r\n4. I have attached the AEP file (as a zip file so it can be attached) that only has the part of the animation that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWe're using both dynamic text and coloring some elements in our animation at runtime using `ValueCallback`. Unfortunately, it looks like it's impossible to target the dynamic texts. We have tried: \r\n\r\n```\r\n        animation.addValueCallback(\r\n            KeyPath(\"**\"),\r\n            LottieProperty.STROKE_COLOR\r\n        ) {\r\n            context!!.getThemeColor(android.R.attr.textColorPrimary)\r\n        }\r\n        animation.addValueCallback(\r\n            KeyPath(\"**\"),\r\n            LottieProperty.COLOR\r\n        ) {\r\n            context!!.getThemeColor(android.R.attr.textColorPrimary)\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it colors everything else in the animation except for our texts.\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?**\r\n3.0.7\r\n\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\napi 23 - 28\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to '...'\r\n2. Click on '....'\r\n3. Scroll down to '....'\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need anything else from me. Happy to provide any of the above if it's useful.","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
