Please describe.**\r\nOur iOS boys have the ability to specify two marker names to animate between.  This is useful because our animation markers do not have durations set on them.\r\n```\r\nanimationView?.play(fromMarker: MarkerNames.loopStart,\r\n                            toMarker: MarkerNames.loopEnd,\r\n                            loopMode: .loop,\r\n                            completion: nil)\r\n```\r\nWe don't have a direct equivalent in Android land.  We can't use `setMinAndMaxFrame(loopStartMarkerName)` because the marker does not have a duration.  We can't use `setMinFrame(loopStartMarkerName)` with `setMaxFrame(loopEndMarkerName)` because an exception will be thrown if done out of order (for instance if changing from 0-100 to 101-200, if we setMinFrame first, it will error out because 101-100 is not a valid range).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAPI parity with iOS via adding a `setMinAndMaxFrame(startmarkerName: String, startmarkerName: String)` method to LottieView, and any other places that make sense (eg LottieDrawable)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently we're working around it with this:\r\n```\r\nval composition = lottieView.composition!!\r\nlottieView.setMinAndMaxFrame(\r\n    composition.getMarker(loopStartMarkerName)!!.startFrame.toInt(),\r\n    (composition.getMarker(loopEndMarkerName)!!.startFrame + 0.99f).toInt()\r\n)\r\n```\r\nCumbersome, non-discoverable, doesn't work if composition not available yet, maybe some other issues\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nLove your work!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1395/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
