For me as a developer it seams to be related to clipping an image to a specific area. The building and tree in the next image should be only visible inside the circle. My Designer and I did together go through the [troubleshooting](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/android?id=troubleshooting) section of the documentation, but I didn't found any mistakes I as a developer made and my designer assured me, she used only [supported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features). I also tested other lottie animations my designer made and they worked fine in that activity (not clipped tho'). My sample app is in the reproduce section together with the AEP file. I would be glad for some hints. \r\n\r\n![HintedImage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7873672/72973175-1352b980-3dcd-11ea-8549-9a3bcd7b68f7.png)\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?** \r\n\r\nLottie Version ⇒ 3.3.0\r\n\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\n\r\nDevice | Version | Problem present\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nGalaxy Nexus | 4.3 | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nASUS_Z008D | 5.0 | :heavy_check_mark:\r\nGalaxy S4 | 5.0.1 | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nEmulator Nexus 5X | 5.0.2 | :heavy_check_mark:  \r\nMoto G | 5.1 | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nGalaxy S5 | 6.0.1 | :heavy_check_mark: \r\nMoto G5 | 7.0 | :x:\r\nNexus 6P | 8.1.0 | :x:\r\nPixel 2 & 3 | 10 | :x:\r\n\r\nBut the behavior on every phone is a bit different:\r\n\r\nGalaxy Nexus 4.3 | Moto G 5.1\r\n--- | ---\r\n![Screenshot_2020-01-23-09-44-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7873672/72975946-f4a2f180-3dd1-11ea-8ecd-8f7738c0f8e4.png) | ![brokenLottieAnimation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7873672/72975923-e94fc600-3dd1-11ea-9386-04f379e4803e.gif) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nI made a **sample project** and there is also the AEP file in there: [SampleProjectAndAEP.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/4102298/SampleProjectAndAEP.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nI assume the above screenshots are enough ^^\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\n1.
