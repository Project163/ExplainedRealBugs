I wanted to play animation manually every time fragment view is loaded (`onViewCreated`).\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1) Inside onViewCreated of Fragment A, set progress to 0 and call `playAnimation`\r\n2) Navigate to Fragment B with back stack entry and press back in order to return to the A\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe animation should play again.\r\n\r\nResult: The animation usually don't animate again after navigating back to fragment A. It shows a fully loaded anim immediately.\r\n\r\nTested on 3.7.1 and 3.2.2 versions.","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1841/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
