much much research I have reached to this code.\r\nEssentially, you have to insert that frameInfo that you receive in the callback inside LottieRelativePointValueCallback which actually does the

LottieRelativeScaleXYValueCallback.\r\nAlso, the hack is bad because LottieFrameInfo#set(...) is annotated  with `@RestrictTo(RestrictTo.Scope.LIBRARY)`.\r\n\r\nUntil any further changes of architecture, please remove these annotations, because the library needs hacks like these in order to be used
