When the `cacheKey` is `null`, the cache function of the `LottieCompositionFactory` recognized and honors this case: https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/ee942249214dd6bb1540b746ca0b678a6382b5ee/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieCompositionFactory.java#L459-L474\r\n\r\nTherefore a new network fetch is initiated, as it should be: https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/ee942249214dd6bb1540b746ca0b678a6382b5ee/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieCompositionFactory.java#L80-L88\r\n\r\nHowever, the `NetworkFetcher` looks in it's cache and returns the cached file, i.e., the end user still sees the wrong animation.
