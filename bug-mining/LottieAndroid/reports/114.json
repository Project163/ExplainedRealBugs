The first segment is supposed to be played in a loop `REVERSE`. \r\nThen press \"Next Segment\". Depending on WHEN you press it, the next segment is most often played backwards.\r\nBut, if you press \"Next Segment (new LottieDrawable)\" then the animation is played correctly, but of course you get a little flicker, when the new drawable is loaded into the image view.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this sample project to test https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/663.\r\nI attached a modified sample project to the referred issue.\r\n\r\n[LottieTest.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/1848037/LottieTest.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
