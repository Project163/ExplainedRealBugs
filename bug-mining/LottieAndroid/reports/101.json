In that issue, someone said issue was fixed in 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT but this version is not available anymore and the newest library version (2.5.0-beta3) still has some issues with some of the animations we use.\r\n\r\nYou can look at mentioned issue to see how view is defined and how animation is played. I've also added `app:lottie_enableMergePathsForKitKatAndAbove=\"true\"` but it did not help.\r\n\r\nI've attached zip with two animations we have problem with. If aep files are needed, I can provide those too.\r\n[Animations.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/1653923/Animations.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/601/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
