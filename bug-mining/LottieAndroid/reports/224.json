When updating to beta 07, all dependencies must also update to use it.  Lottie does not appear to have done so yet and so results in the following crash when attempting to use a lottie composable:\r\n\r\n    java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No interface method startReplaceableGroup(ILjava/lang/String;)V in class Landroidx/compose/runtime/Composer; or its super classes (declaration of 'androidx.compose.runtime.Composer' appears in /data/app/com.alphero.bach-gJLQhlnFXyfvM_FIorGBAw==/base.apk)\r\n        at com.airbnb.lottie.compose.LottieAnimationStateKt.rememberLottieAnimationState(Unknown Source:7)\r\n\r\nThe compose docs give a heads up that this will happen - https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-foundation\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82988810/118754461-37d47e00-b8bb-11eb-8645-98a4afbf2d8d.png)\r\n\r\nThis also happens on the latest snapshot, \"com.airbnb.android:lottie-compose:1.0.0-beta04-2-SNAPSHOT\"\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Create jetpack compose project using beta07.\r\n2. Add latest lottie dependency \r\n3. Put `rememberLottieAnimationState()` somewhere in the composition\r\n4. Run app - it will crash when attempting to render that composition","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1808/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
