Issues from [Lottie sponsors](https://github.com/users/gpeal/sponsorship) will be prioritized.*\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have an animation with many markers. And I want to play it from current marker + 1 to current marker + 2 always (as result of user input). For example: currentMarkerIndex = 0, then I want to play from marker at index 1 to marker at index 2; currentMarkerIndex = 2, then I want to lay from marker at index 3 to marker at index 4.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I use `setMinFrame(String markerName)` , `setMaxFrame(String markerName)` methods of `LottieAnimationView`.  \r\n\r\nI found out that I can get List of markers using `List<Marker> getMarkers()` method of `LottieComposition`. So I thought I don't really need to have markers names in my app, I can use them from List of markers. E.g. if currentMarker index = 0, I just get minFrame marker name by getting marker at index 1, and max Frame at index 2. And then use  `setMinFrame(String markerName)` and `setMaxFrame(String markerName)`.\r\n\r\nProblem is, I can't get name from `Marker`. `Marker` has field `private final String name;` , but there's no way to get it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be nice to have a public method `String getName` in `Marker`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI just declared my own list of marker names inside app. Not a big deal, but it would be nice to have possibility to get name from `Marker`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
