[Repo case](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/compare/master...awenger:lottie-android:listener-triggered-twice-repro?expand=1)\r\n\r\n### Problem: Listeners attached to a LottieTask trigger twice if the url is already cached from a previous request.\r\n\r\n#### Case 1\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n- Click on the \"Click me a\" Button\r\n- Click on the \"Click me a\" Button (second time)\r\n- Click on the \"Click me a\" Button (third time)\r\n- Resulting logs:\r\n```\r\n18:01:46.059  D  Click me a clicked\r\n18:01:46.373  D  onResult 0\r\n18:01:48.504  D  Click me a clicked\r\n18:01:48.505  D  onResult 1\r\n18:01:48.534  D  onResult 1 // second/duplicate invocation of the callback\r\n18:02:29.887  D  Click me a clicked\r\n18:02:29.888  D  onResult 2\r\n18:02:29.899  D  onResult 2 // second/duplicate invocation of the callback\r\n```\r\n#### Case 2\r\n\r\nThis behaviour becomes a problem if the callback is wrapped within a `suspendCancellableCoroutine` ([here](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/compare/master...awenger:lottie-android:listener-triggered-twice-repro?expand=1#diff-45ce4872230400baf686c8fb7430cc5c35f899bb2a1efb1383ef60fa5513c417R64-R75))\r\n- Click on the \"Click me b\" Button\r\n- App crashes because the continuation is resumed twice\r\n- Resulting logs:\r\n```\r\n18:03:31.383  D  Click me b clicked\r\n18:03:31.411  D  Shutting down
