Please describe.**\r\nThe colorFilter attr is read using `typedArray.getColor`. This accommodates both single colors and color state lists (CSLs), with the caveat that if a CSL is used, it'll return the default color.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<selector xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\r\n    <item android:alpha=\"0.54\" android:color=\"?attr/colorOnBackground\" />\r\n</selector>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Marshmallow+, the above works great. It's a recommended pattern for define alpha-variants of theme colors, without having to create custom theme attributes (and specifying each of them literally, with the alpha baked in).\r\n\r\n**On Lollipop, CSLs don't work well if they contain theme attributes - they'll render as red. This issue is to add support for Lollipop by using `AppCompatResources` to load the color.**\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRead the colorFilter attribute as a resource id, then use `AppCompatResources` to load the resource in a backwards compatible fashion. This will work for both regular color resources and also for CSLs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've wrapped the view and re-apply the color filter - I'm not sure whether using `addValueCallback` (in addition to the superclass calling it for colorfilter) will mean that there's multiple passes.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass LottieLoadingSpinnerView(context: Context, attrs: AttributeSet) : LottieAnimationView(\r\n        context,\r\n        attrs,\r\n        DEF_STYLE_ATTR\r\n) {\r\n    init {\r\n        // we're reading the colorFilter attr so we can reapply it with support for CSLs on API 21/22\r\n        context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.LottieAnimationView, DEF_STYLE_ATTR, DEF_STYLE_RES).apply {\r\n            if (hasValue(R.styleable.LottieAnimationView_lottie_colorFilter)) {\r\n                val colorFilterResId = getResourceId(R.styleable.LottieAnimationView_lottie_colorFilter, -1)\r\n                val colorFilterColorInt = AppCompatResources.getColorStateList(context, colorFilterResId).defaultColor\r\n                val filter = SimpleColorFilter(colorFilterColorInt)\r\n                val keyPath = KeyPath(\"**\")\r\n                val callback = LottieValueCallback<ColorFilter>(filter)\r\n                addValueCallback(keyPath, LottieProperty.COLOR_FILTER, callback)\r\n            }\r\n            recycle()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nHappy to raise a PR if this issue is accepted.\r\n\r\nBefore | After\r\n---|---\r\n![spinner-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2678555/79865432-11e85b80-83d3-11ea-886d-292a6ccf6fa7.png) | ![spinner-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2678555/79865437-13198880-83d3-11ea-9946-42e403e51e7b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Lottie is supported and developed on nights and weekends.
