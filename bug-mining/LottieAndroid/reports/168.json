It looks like the Android player moves the dashes less than the other players.\r\n\r\nHere's a JSON file: [static-dash.json.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/2080137/static-dash.json.zip) - it contains black lines with dashes and offsets increasing from 0 to 240 (from top to bottom). The small blue ones are rectangles used for reference. They are there to make comparison of different players easier.\r\n\r\nThe JSON file renders like this on Lottie web player 5.1.16 and Lottie-ios Mac Viewer:\r\n\r\n![static-dash-web](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6185066/41096301-e42e57a8-6a5c-11e8-8ae3-ecbb4940e839.png)\r\n\r\nAnd below is a screenshot of Lottie-Android v2.5.5 (from the Lottiefiles Android Previewer).
