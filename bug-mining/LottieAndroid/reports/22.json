So i got space between animation and screen edge. I solved this issue by dynamically changing view height to proper value:\r\n```\r\nDisplayMetrics displayMetrics = getResources().getDisplayMetrics();\r\n\t\tfloat dpWidth = displayMetrics.widthPixels / displayMetrics.density;\r\n\t\tfloat dpHeight = displayMetrics.heightPixels / displayMetrics.density;\r\n\t\tmLottieAnimationView.getLayoutParams().height = (int) (displayMetrics.density * 146f / (360f / dpWidth));\r\n```\r\nAfter applying new height on view, animation viewport fits screen width well. \r\nSo my question is this fix save in terms of stability and performance?\r\nPS: i don't have masks or mattes.","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
