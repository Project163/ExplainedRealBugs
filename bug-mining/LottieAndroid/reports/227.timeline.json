LottieTask under the hood incurred several extra thread hops including a main thread post. Switching it to a result like this is both faster and also enables custom factories to be used. From my initial tests, this cut the parse time for the heart animation in the repo roughly in half.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, LaunchedTask takes a few ms to start. I tried with `rememberCoroutineScope().launch` and the initial delay was the same so I'm not sure if there is anything else that can be done here.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1880","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5255767223,"node_id":"CE_lADOBC8mW846fr0szwAAAAE5RKS3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/events/5255767223","actor":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-03T23:10:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5255767296,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC8mW846fr0szwAAAAE5RKUA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/events/5255767296","actor":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c8c699714cd62766e04d210d0ceabf40e2ba2b9a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/commits/c8c699714cd62766e04d210d0ceabf40e2ba2b9a","created_at":"2021-09-03T23:10:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5269453459,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBC8mW846fr0szwAAAAE6FXqT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/events/5269453459","actor":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ac17e0f977ad8f59463bb96085937923db6e862a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/commits/ac17e0f977ad8f59463bb96085937923db6e862a","created_at":"2021-09-08T03:51:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
