It just \"rounds\" to the next full frame (e.g. different progress values lead to the same frame shown). [setProgress](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/master/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable.java#L680) does this rounding:\r\n```\r\nsetFrame((int) MiscUtils.lerp(composition.getStartFrame(), composition.getEndFrame(), progress));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe iOS however seem to interpolate between Frames. And of course Lottie does this internally when the animation is played normally. Hence I think it should be possible for `setProgress` too 😃 \r\n\r\nMy usecase is to align the animation progress to a scroll state. See [this Stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55063434/align-android-lottie-animation-to-scrolling/55124308) for a visual representation of the problem.\r\n\r\nA simpler way to reproduce the issue is to create a `ValueAnimator` and manually update the animation progress. The issue is not dependent on any specific animation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval valueAnimator = ValueAnimator.ofFloat(0f, 1f)\r\nvalueAnimator.duration = 30000\r\nvalueAnimator.addUpdateListener { animation ->\r\n    lottieAnimationView.progress = animation.animatedFraction\r\n}\r\nvalueAnimator.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny chance this could be supported by Lottie?","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
