My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features).\r\n        I'm not sure if this counts as anchor point grouping\r\n3. I know what part of my animation doesn't work.\r\n        The only differences between the two layers in my text file are with the anchor point(k values on the \"a:\" attribute), and text box(sz and ps attributes)\r\n4.
