I noticed that there is quite some CPU usage when the app is in the background and tried to investigate.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me looping animations do not pause/stop when the containing `LottieAnimationView` is off screen, and/or the Activity is paused. \r\n\r\nI believe this is due to the cleanup code being only in `onDetachedFromWindow()` which is not necessarily being called once the Activity goes into a paused state and most definitely not, when the view is simply not visible (`GONE`, `INVISIBLE` ) anymore.\r\n\r\nI have created a little test project illustrating the issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/florianPOLARSTEPS/lottie_leak \r\n\r\nStarting it up you will see an empty screen, with an invisible (`GONE`) lottie view, that shows a toast each time the animation is repeated. If you put the app in the background, the toast will continue.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
