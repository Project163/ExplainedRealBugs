In light of this we should consider adding the relevant recognition in the library.\n\n---\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nEnhancement. lottie-android should recognize `.lot` and the `video/lottie+json` mime type on the network loader\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n * pick up `.lot` from storage, and inside `.zip|.lottie` files\n * recognize `video/lottie+json` in the network pipeline\n\nIn both these instances, they should be treated the same as `.json` would be. \nfor clarity, this in now way disqualifies the usage of `.json` to transport animations. The `.lot` extension is in addition to the existing mechanism\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nn/a\n\n**Additional context**\n * [official Assignment](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/video/lottie+json)\n * [standards listings](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)\n * [organizational listing with LAC recognized](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iesg-recognized-organizations/iesg-recognized-organizations.xhtml)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2614/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
