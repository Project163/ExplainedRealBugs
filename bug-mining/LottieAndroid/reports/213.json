I am not using `LottieAnimationView` (and my use case requires it to be this way).\r\n\r\nAndroid [drawables](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable) are expected to follow setBounds and scale accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Lottie Version**\r\n3.4.0\r\n\r\n**Android Version**\r\n29.0.3\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n_Code_\r\n```\r\ndrawable = LottieDrawable()\r\nvar composition = LottieCompositionFactory.fromJsonStringSync(res, \"\") // res is any animation as JSON string\r\ndrawable.setComposition(composition.value)\r\n//            var drawableWidth = composition.value?.bounds?.width()\r\n//            drawable.scale = 0.5f\r\ndrawable.setBounds(0, 0, 100, 100) // Does nothing for positioning and scaling\r\ndrawable.repeatCount = LottieDrawable.INFINITE\r\ndrawable.playAnimation()\r\n\r\n...\r\n...\r\n\r\ndrawable.draw(canvas)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe animation fires and update handlers work as expected. However, the positioning and scaling is incorrect. I can manually scale the drawable by calling `setScale()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I do the same thing using a `LottieAnimationView` and set its layout, the animation is scaled and positioned correctly.\r\n\r\nThis issue is reproducible with any Lottie Animation file.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
