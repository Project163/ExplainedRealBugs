This animations is a color modification of another animations from telegram stickers. The original animations played normal with lottie library, but color modified animations not work. I don't know what modified in this animations (I'm not a author of modifications) but Telegram App show this normal, and [Lottie Preview Page](https://lottiefiles.com/preview/telegram) for testing json animations show that test passed.\r\n\r\n**What version of Lottie did you test this on?**\r\n3.4.1\r\n\r\n**What version of Android did you test this on?**\r\nAndroid 9 and Android 10.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n1. Just load json animation to lottieView\r\n2. See... nothing. No error in logcat. No animation in view.\r\n\r\nMy code for load animation:\r\n```\r\nLottieComposition lottieComposition= LottieCompositionFactory.fromAssetSync(mContext, \"001.json\").getValue();\r\nlottieView.setComposition(lottieComposition);\r\nlottieView.playAnimation();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFiles for testing:\r\n[GreenCherry.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/4978082/GreenCherry.zip)\r\n[NewSteamyJulia.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/4978083/NewSteamyJulia.zip)\r\n[WhiteHonka.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/4978087/WhiteHonka.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\n1. My animation doesn't use any [unsupported features](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features).\r\n2. I know what part of my animation doesn't work.\r\n3. I have created a simplified version of my animation \r\n4. I have attached the AEP file (as a zip file so it can be attached) that only has the part of the animation that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Lottie is supported and developed on nights and weekends. Please consider [sponsoring Lottie](https://github.com/users/gpeal/sponsorship) to prioritize this issue and help support this issue as well as future investments.*\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
