Set animation passing String JSON filename\r\n2. Add animation listener that calls playAnimation () in on-end listener method\r\n3. Call playAnimation ()\r\n\r\nObserve that animation plays, listener method is called but animation does not play again.\r\n\r\nI actually want to alternate between two animations with the listener setting and starting one, then setting and starting another and this isn't working but the above appears to be at the heart of the issue.\r\n\r\nI need to use a listener as I need to make other UI changes in sync with the transition between plays.
