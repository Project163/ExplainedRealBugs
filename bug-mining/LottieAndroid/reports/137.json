I can change its position by applying a value callback to its keypath. What I need is to listen to its position without modifying it.\r\n\r\nIf not, will you handle it in future releases?\r\n\r\nI tried to use LottieValueCallback to get the position:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nlottieAnimationView.addValueCallback(\r\n                    new KeyPath(\"Gift Outlines\"),\r\n                    LottieProperty.TRANSFORM_POSITION,\r\n                    new LottieValueCallback<PointF>(){\r\n                        @Override\r\n                        public PointF getValue(LottieFrameInfo<PointF> frameInfo) {\r\n                            return super.getValue(frameInfo);\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n            );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `super.getValue(frameInfo)`  always  returns null. I assumed `super.getValue(frameInfo)` return the position of the \"Gift Outlines\" at the current call and it will be called each time \"Gift Outlines\" moves . I need t to listen to \"Gift Outlines\" position.
