In these cases `autoPlay` would fail on a re-attachment of the fragment.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/3a5d706bad862a4eec9e3b4bc10a0c693077987e/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieAnimationView.java#L310-L311\r\n\r\nAlthough in a normal scenario it will work in the cases like described above it will fail to play the animation and you would have to manually call `playAnimation()` in `onResume()` or the like. Also if you look at it from a logical point of view it does not make a lot of sense that `autoPlay` should only be applied once.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Checkout the demo app\r\n2. Click on 'bottom nav 2'\r\n2. Click on 'bottom nav 1'\r\n4. See the animation not playing\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
