What happens is that the circle surrounding the exlamation mark becomes a rhombus on Android device.\r\n\r\nI have digged a little more inside the issue and it seems, but i am not a lottie expert, that when the layer that contains the circle rotates its content by 90 degrees to change the animation starting point,  this rotation have an effect on the bezier curves that form the circle, changing its shape. This doesn't happen on similar animations that doesn't use this rotation. It is only a supposition.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue just play the icona_ko animation, that i have attacched here, on an android device and you will see the difference with the lottie online player.\r\nI have attacched also a similar animation that instead works correctly, it's name is icona_ko_working.\r\n[animations.zip](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/files/9877290/animations.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
