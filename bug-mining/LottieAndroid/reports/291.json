Note that `heartUrl2` test fails.\r\n\r\nThe test class sets a `TemporaryFolder` as Lottie's network cache directory `@Before` each test. The `TemporaryFolder` is deleted after each test.\r\n\r\nThe first test, `heartUrl`, works as expected, generating a screenshot with a heart image loaded from the provided URL.\r\n\r\nThe second test, `heartUrl2`, fails. Reading down the stacktrace you can see that the cache directory is not a directory. This is because the directory no longer exists; it was deleted after the first test. Lottie is still holding and using a reference to the cache dir from the first `initialize` call, rather than the one from the second `initialize` call.\r\n\r\n**Possible fixes**\r\nOne approach would be to throw an exception on subsequent calls to `initialize`. But this would make my use-case linked above—re-initializing Lottie for each Paparazzi JUnit test—impossible. To support my use-case, a `Lottie.reset` API could be added to clear previously-initialized settings. This could be `@VisibleForTesting` if you want to discourage its use in production code.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to decide that it is not an error to call `initialize` multiple times, and silently replace any old configuration with each call to `initialize`.\r\n\r\nI'd love to submit a PR implementing whatever solution is preferred.","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2245/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
