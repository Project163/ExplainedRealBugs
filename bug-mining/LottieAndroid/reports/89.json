So progress of 0..1 also sets the progress of the Lottie animation.\r\nBut here comes the problem. I animate between the current progress and a new destination.\r\nSo for instance in the first step I set \r\n`setMinAndMaxProgress(0f, 0.1f)`\r\nOnce the user progresses, I set \r\n`setMinAndMaxProgress(0.1f, 0.2f)` (the old \"max\" is the new \"min\")\r\nBut here lies the problem. It throws an exception that \r\n`Min might not be >= MAX.  (LottieValueAnimator, Line 64).`\r\n\r\nThe issue is, **setMin is called first but still has the max value of the call before.** So the app crashes. \r\n\r\nCurrently I can work around by **setting setMinAndMaxProgress(0f, 1f) before and then calling the real values again**. But when using setMinAndMaxProgress() I wouldn't expect to compare the min value with the old max value.","closed_by":{"login":"gpeal","id":1307745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal","html_url":"https://github.com/gpeal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpeal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
