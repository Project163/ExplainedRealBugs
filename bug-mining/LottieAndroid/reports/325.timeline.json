encountered a similar issue, and after investigating, I believe the reason is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the intermittent exceptions when parsing a double value like 796.05 in the nextInt() method likely stems from floating-point precision errors. In Java (and Android), floating-point numbers are not always stored with exact precision, especially for values with decimal places. As a result, 796.05 might be stored internally as something slightly different, such as 796.0499999... or 796.0500001..., which can lead to inconsistencies during parsing.\r\n\r\nHere’s how these precision issues can lead to intermittent behavior:\r\n\r\nFloating-Point Precision Variability\r\nWhen 796.05 is parsed through Double.parseDouble(peekedString), it may be stored as 796.0499999.... Casting this to int will yield 796. However, if the parsed value happens to be slightly closer to 796.0500001..., the casted int will still be 796, but the comparison in nextInt() (result != asDouble) might fail, triggering an exception.\r\n\r\nInconsistent Comparison Results\r\nDue to these floating-point precision issues, the comparison between the int-casted value and the original double can intermittently pass or fail, depending on how closely the parsed double aligns with its intended value.\r\n\r\nThese floating-point precision limitations seem to be the underlying cause of the intermittent exceptions.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/comments/2477980037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JuHyang","id":19303278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzAzMjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19303278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang","html_url":"https://github.com/JuHyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JuHyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/comments/2492922462","html_url":"https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2552#issuecomment-2492922462","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/2552","id":2492922462,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBC8mW86Ulvpe","user":{"login":"MiJey","id":45025283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MDI1Mjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45025283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey","html_url":"https://github.com/MiJey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiJey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-22T05:49:08Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T05:56:57Z","body":"Hello @gpeal,\r\n\r\nI’ve analyzed the issue and would like to share my findings below.\r\n\r\nIf the fractional part of `asDouble` is not 0, the check `result != asDouble` below will throw a JsonDataException.  \r\nFor example, if `asDouble` is 796.05, `result` becomes 796, and the check `result != asDouble` evaluates to true because 796.00 != 796.05, resulting in an exception.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this condition was added under the assumption that Lottie JSON files would not contain numbers with decimal points (this is my personal assumption).  \r\nHowever, some JSON files generated by the editor provided by LottieFiles include numbers with decimal points.\r\n\r\nDifferences of 1 pixel in values like width or height are almost imperceptible to the eye. Therefore, we chose to ignore such minor precision issues and commented out the condition.\r\n\r\nBelow is the actual code we commented out:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// JsonUtf8Reader.java\r\n  @Override public int nextInt() throws IOException {\r\n    int p = peeked;\r\n    if (p == PEEKED_NONE) {\r\n      p = doPeek();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int result;\r\n    // ...
