This is very useful with REST calls that return an array of objects and one wants to assert on a given property of a given object with a given id, for example. This involves searching in the array. See: http://defiantjs.com\n\nI imagine the patch is to inject the DefiantJS lib. It looks like it should be done here:\n\n```\n    public Object evaluateExpression(RestResponse response, String expression) {\n        if (expression == null) {\n            return null;\n        }\n        Context context = Context.enter();\n        ScriptableObject scope = context.initStandardObjects();\n        injectFitNesseSymbolMap(scope);\n        injectResponse(context, scope, response);\n        Object result = evaluateExpression(context, scope, expression);\n        return result;\n    }\n```\n\nMaybe a generalization of this ticket is to allow people to inject the JS libs they want to use in the snippets. This way you don't need to hardcode any specific lib.\n","closed_by":{"login":"smartrics","id":140858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics","html_url":"https://github.com/smartrics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
