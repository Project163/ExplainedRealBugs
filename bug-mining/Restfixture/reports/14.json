Unfortunately this message is localized and the test will fail if the message do not come up in english.\n\nThe easiest solution would be not to check the message itself and only check that the exception is thrown.\n\nAlternatively, we should set the locale either in the build system or in the test itself. I tried the latter, but could not get it work. (that does not mean it is not possible)\n\nIn any case I find it a bit tedious to check the content of the exception message... Is it important to make sure the proper exception is raised?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJP\n","closed_by":{"login":"smartrics","id":140858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics","html_url":"https://github.com/smartrics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
