I have successfully added a 'setHeader' line.\n\n  |setHeader|Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8|\n\nwhich has enabled the PUT request to succeed.\n\nFor future test case debugging, I would like to do as you suggest and enable 'wire logging'. However, I have so far been unsuccessful. I have found (and followed) the documentation at:\n\n  http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fitnesse/message/19326\n  http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/logging.html\n\nI have also been able to successfully configure and generate logs for my own Java project. Is there a more detailed page for debugging the configuration of logging for FitNesse?\n\nThanks for the help.\n\nRegards,\nPeter\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/comments/10575168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"baldwinp","id":2793767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTM3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2793767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp","html_url":"https://github.com/baldwinp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baldwinp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/comments/11112576","html_url":"https://github.com/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/46#issuecomment-11112576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/46","id":11112576,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTEyNTc2","user":{"login":"smartrics","id":140858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics","html_url":"https://github.com/smartrics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-07T00:16:34Z","updated_at":"2012-12-07T00:16:34Z","body":"I
