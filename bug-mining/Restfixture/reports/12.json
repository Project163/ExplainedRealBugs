The config is passed and it stays like that. It is impossible to do some processing that computes the password. This would allow scenarios like mine: I must log in with a central Authentication Authority and the result token becomes the password for further requests.\n\nI recommend changing doMethod in RestFixture so that it always expands the authentication values/variables and resets these in the RestClient. This means the RestClient must have an API to set the authentication values.\n","closed_by":{"login":"smartrics","id":140858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics","html_url":"https://github.com/smartrics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartrics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/96/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/96/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
