The implementation takes an auth token in the request header.\n\nIn our tests we need to generate a new auth token (which we can do via a POST). And we can capture the token value in the response body and save it in a restfixture variable via a \"let\".\n\n| let |  acctToken1 | js | jsonbody.reponse | |\n\nThen we need to set the request header for subsequent tests to contain the value of this variable:\n\n| setHeader | Authorization: %acctToken1% |\n\nBut we see that the value isn't getting expanded.\n\nI assume we need to enhance the fixture to do this.  Is that true, or is there a way to do what we want without making an enhancement?\n\n  -Jon\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
