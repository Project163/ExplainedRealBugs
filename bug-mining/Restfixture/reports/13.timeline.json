a lot for the fix! I'll test it ASAP.\n\nI agree with you about the encoding in the URL.\n\nFact is, the webservice I am calling will make some computation based on the URI provided as an argument (thus the second \"?\" being there, part of the embedded URI), and the webservice does not return the same value if I encode the characters... I tried this obviously :-)\n\nI agree that we may consider this as a lack of the webservice: it should URI-decode the embedded URI and perform the same computation either way. However in my case, this webservice is not part of the SUT but belongs to another team so the change may not be easy to make -- at the very least, I would not expect the change to be available immediately. I'll talk with them, just to make sure what is the expected behavior...\n\nSo, thanks again!\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/comments/73004416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jplambert","id":10744293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ0Mjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10744293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert","html_url":"https://github.com/jplambert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/comments/73036679","html_url":"https://github.com/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/112#issuecomment-73036679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smartrics/RestFixture/issues/112","id":73036679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDM2Njc5","user":{"login":"jplambert","id":10744293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ0Mjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10744293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert","html_url":"https://github.com/jplambert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jplambert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-05T12:11:19Z","updated_at":"2015-02-05T12:11:19Z","body":"Just a final comment to confirm that the fix works.
