You might want to do this by implementing a solution that extends `OkHttpDataSource` instead, since that'll give you consistent behavior across all Android version, meaning that if it works, it'll work everywhere. It also means you'll be using a network stack that's just \"better\", according to most

Different Shoutcast server implementations do different things, the servers I care about work. My point was that if someone needs a library for shoutcast metadata but doesn't get it to work with the server *he* uses, I'd be more than happy to take patches to port to OkHttp. At the moment I just lack a reason to do it myself. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, the idea of this issue is to have some list of third-party extensions that might be useful to Exoplayer users.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/issues/comments/360249511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"saschpe","id":115275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe","html_url":"https://github.com/saschpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/issues/comments/376715359","html_url":"https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3735#issuecomment-376715359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3735","id":376715359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjcxNTM1OQ==","user":{"login":"ojw28","id":7881572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODE1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7881572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28","html_url":"https://github.com/ojw28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T00:07:06Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T00:08:03Z","body":"I think we're interested in merging this in some form, possibly directly into the existing OkHttp extension as we'd like it to be based on `OkHttpDataSource` rather than `DefaultHttpDataSource`.\r\n\r\nIt's fine if you don't want to spend time making changes yourself, but in order to look at merging we'd need you to contribute the extension in its current form by opening a pull request to our `dev-v2` branch, and signing the corresponding CLA as described [here](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/blob/release-v2/CONTRIBUTING.md).
