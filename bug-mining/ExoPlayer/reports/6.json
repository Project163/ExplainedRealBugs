Therefore `DownloadService.notifyDownloadChanged` is never called and `startForeground` is never called on the new service. The app process is then killed after roughly 10 seconds as the scheduler has been cancelled.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps\r\nUsing the exoplayer app:\r\n- Start downloading some content\r\n- Click back to exit the app. Downloading notification should be shown.\r\n- Turn off network. Downloading notification should be hidden.\r\n- Wait approximately 2 minutes.\r\n- Turn on network. Downloading notification is not reshown when it should be.\r\n\r\n### Link to test content\r\nTested using `WV: Clear SD & HD (MP4,H264)` in the sample app.\r\n\r\n### Version of ExoPlayer being used\r\n2.10.7. Also reproduced the issue on 2.11.1.\r\n\r\n### Device(s) and version(s) of Android being used\r\nPixel 3XL Android 10 (QQ1A.191205.008)","closed_by":{"login":"ojw28","id":7881572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODE1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7881572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28","html_url":"https://github.com/ojw28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/issues/6798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/issues/6798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
