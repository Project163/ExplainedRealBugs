Since I had the same challenge I came up with [an extension](https://github.com/saschpe/android-exoplayer2-ext-icy). It's in use already but I'd like to know if it makese sense to be mentioned in the extension directory or if there's interest in merging it into ExoPlayer's code-base. I guess it needs more documentation and tests but I'd be curious.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ojw28","id":7881572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODE1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7881572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28","html_url":"https://github.com/ojw28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ojw28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3735/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
