This behavior has only been observed when connecting to an Azure SQL database. When the exact same query is run against a local SQL Server instance, the connection is correctly closed and released immediately after the data is loaded.\n\nThe connection leak is confirmed by using a DbConnectionInterceptor to track ConnectionOpened and ConnectionClosed events. For Azure SQL, the ConnectionClosed event is never fired for the transaction.\n\n```\n// C# Code to reproduce the issue\nvar amenities = await _databaseContext.Amenities\n    .Include(x => x.ClubAmenities)\n    .AsSplitQuery()\n    .GroupBy(x => x.Category)\n    .ToListAsync(cancellationToken);\n```\n\n**Additional Context**\n- This issue seems to be caused by the specific interaction between GroupBy() and AsSplitQuery() when EF Core communicates with Azure SQL.\n- Removing either .AsSplitQuery() or .GroupBy() from the query resolves the issue, and the connection is released correctly.\n- A DbCommandInterceptor was also used, which confirms that the SQL commands are generated and executed successfully. The problem lies in the connection lifecycle management post-execution.\n\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\n// To run this program:\n// 1. Create a new .NET Console Application.\n// 2. Install the following NuGet packages:\n//    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\n//    - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (for migrations, if needed)\n// 3. Replace the placeholder connection string with your Azure SQL database connection string.\n// 4.

This later leads to an exhausted connection pool and to an application failure in a way that's hard to track down and connect to the actual problematic EF LINQ query.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nTwo users reported.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nNo - this bug was present when the final GroupBy feature was first introduced in EF 7.0 (in #19929)\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nAdding test coverage here is quite difficult/impractical - the bug is that a certain internal resource (DbDataReader) doesn't get disposed, which isn't something visible we can check. \r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nExtremely low. The fix is very targeted and simply does the as for very similar other code (e.g. non-GroupBy SplitQueryingEnumerable).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18979453278,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs6Qr3r5zwAAAARrQ3le","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18979453278","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b460f82f8a0ab57ba571780dc23c6f017917821f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/b460f82f8a0ab57ba571780dc23c6f017917821f","created_at":"2025-08-04T22:24:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18979472517,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs6Qr3r5zwAAAARrQ8SF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18979472517","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"08cefb32ddec47976d1868189982293d869e7010","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/08cefb32ddec47976d1868189982293d869e7010","created_at":"2025-08-04T22:24:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18979488276,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAPaMMs6Qr3r5zwAAAARrRAIU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18979488276","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-04T22:25:56Z","label":{"name":"Servicing-consider","color":"bfd4f2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18979488285,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs6Qr3r5zwAAAARrRAId","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18979488285","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_ur
