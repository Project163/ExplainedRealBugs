scaffolding switched to using templates in EF 7.0, there's no longer an easy way for a provider to add arbitrary namespaces; users can easily modify the templates in any way they want (that was the point of this feature), but providers cannot.\r\n\r\nNote that [CSharpDbContextGenerator](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/v6.0.12/src/EFCore.Design/Scaffolding/Internal/CSharpDbContextGenerator.cs) was internal in 6.0 and below; you should really try to avoid accessing/overriding internal EF APIs so that this kind of breakage doesn't happen. If you finding yourself needing to do something with an internal API, you should signal this to us so we can provide guidance on an alternative implementation, or possibly change things within EF in order to accommodate your needs.\r\n\r\nConcretely, we may want to add a a template parameter allowing extra namespaces to be passed; CSharpModelGenerator is still internal, so that still wouldn't be sufficient as a 1st-class way for a provider to inject additional namespaces. /cc @bricelam @ajcvickers\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, if you don't want to change the namespace of your extension methods, I think you'll have to instruct your users to edit their templates to add the namespace, [as per the
