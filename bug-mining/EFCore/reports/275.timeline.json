It's an API for both our web app and mobile app. Memory usage typically grows from 50MB to 3GB during peak hours (8-16) and only get released when things calm down at approximately 16 in the afternoon. During these 8 hours we have around 60k requests to our API. It's a multitenant app with Azure Sql database per tenant and approximately 180 tenants. We use ModelCacheKeyFactory to get correct global query filters for each tenant. Not only that, but we also have to differentiate between user roles in a tenant, given that we do authorization through EF Core global query filters.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/23d32c30-3dbd-40b4-aae6-2c888be61873)\r\n\r\nNot sure what happens in the afternoon, but could it be IIS recycling? It's not restarting, that I have checked. Anyway, what could possibly cause such a big pile-up of memory in Gen 2 and the DbContext ServiceProviderCache?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/7d560f56-6c31-4b8d-a1bf-ad62a07cdfa1)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/2385ded1-2cb4-4998-ab32-beb4637002d1)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/fb894cf1-3d71-4287-ab9a-1622c5abf0ff)\r\n\r\nAs for the code I have tried to short it down to the essentials. In out startup.cs we use services.AddDbContext<IXDbContext, XDbContext>(); so nothing fancy there, but in the DbContext there is a lot more going on:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/7003ff04-fff3-4366-94a5-8585c1c51f90)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/06955e25-72c0-4761-8a58-22900221b6e6)\r\n\r\nThe EntityDbContextManager uses reflection to get the correct Authorization handler:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/f5ca61ec-e04e-48c8-8bb1-71cd493fb2e6)\r\n\r\nA typical Authorization handler for a given entity (i.e. User) looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/29543642/7b232a18-501d-4cdc-88e1-c53eb90acb19)\r\n\r\nSo all in all a lot going on here. The question is why does ServiceProviderCache retain so much memory under load? The system works as it should, just not happy with all this retained bytes ending up in Gen 2. I fear there could be problems ahead as more tenants are added. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-01T11:05:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-01T11:05:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31901","id":1918369314,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPaMMs5yV_4i","number":31901,"title":"Store

https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/issues/1164. The parameter InstrumentModulesWithoutLocalSources has been removed. since it can be handled by setting ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to None.\nThe default heuristics for determining whether to instrument an assembly has been changed. In previous versions any missing source file was taken as a signal that it was a third-party project that shouldn't be instrumented, with exceptions for some common file name patterns for source generators. Now only assemblies where no source files at all can be found are excluded from instrumentation, and the code for detecting source generator files have been removed. To get back to the behaviour that at least one missing file is sufficient to exclude an assembly, set ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to MissingAny, or use assembly exclusion filters for more fine-grained control.\n\n[Diff between 3.2.0 and 6.0.0](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/compare/v5.7.2...v6.0.0)\n\n## 5.8.0\n\n### Fixed\n-Fix TypeLoadException when referencing

https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/issues/1164. The parameter InstrumentModulesWithoutLocalSources has been removed. since it can be handled by setting ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to None.\nThe default heuristics for determining whether to instrument an assembly has been changed. In previous versions any missing source file was taken as a signal that it was a third-party project that shouldn't be instrumented, with exceptions for some common file name patterns for source generators. Now only assemblies where no source files at all can be found are excluded from instrumentation, and the code for detecting source generator files have been removed. To get back to the behaviour that at least one missing file is sufficient to exclude an assembly, set ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to MissingAny, or use assembly exclusion filters for more fine-grained control.\n\n[Diff between 3.2.0 and 6.0.0](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/compare/v5.7.2...v6.0.0)\n\n## 5.8.0\n\n### Fixed\n-Fix TypeLoadException when referencing

notes</summary>\n\n_Sourced from [Dapper's releases](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/releases)._\n\n## 2.1.66\n\nWARNING: `DateOnly` / `TimeOnly` support, added in 2.1.37, had multiple failure modes, and was quickly reverted pending finding the time to investigate what went wrong. The impacted packages were unlisted, with 2.1.35 being the last listed version. This is the first version *after* that debacle, which means if you are using the impacted 2.1.37 or similar: this version will effectively *remove* functionality (although it was actually disabled a very long time ago).\n\n---\n\n## What's Changed\n* TFM update; +net8 (LTS), -net5, -net7 by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2144\n* normalize async API surface over all TFMs by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2144\n* disable DateOnly / TimeOnly support by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2080\n* change dapper-plus citation by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2083\n* Do not close the inner reader when disposing wrapped data readers by @​0xced in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2100\n* CI -
