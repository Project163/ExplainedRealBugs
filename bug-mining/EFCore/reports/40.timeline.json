Can you provide a bit more context on this?\r\n\r\nSure. Check out https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/55860 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/56475.\r\n\r\nSome app models (like Blazor WASM and Maui) want to produce as small of applications as possible. One of the ways to make it smaller is to trim out unnecessary attributes, like the Nulalble attributes: `AllowNull`, `MaybeNullWhen`, `Nullable`, etc. In order to support that we added a \"feature switch\" in .NET 6 that allows apps to trim these nullable attributes. When that switch is set to `NullabilityInfoContextSupport=false`, calling NullabilityInfoContext with throw the exception listed above in the OP.\r\n\r\nBy default, Maui iOS and Android applications have this setting `NullabilityInfoContextSupport=false`. So by default, if you create a Maui iOS or Android app and use EF, you get this exception.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this, the developer can explicitly set `NullabilityInfoContextSupport=true` in their .csproj.\r\n\r\nMy proposal here is that just by referencing the EntityFramework NuGet packages, we should consider setting `NullabilityInfoContextSupport=true`, which will override the default value set in Maui and Blazor WASM projects.\r\n\r\n> Is this simply a property we'd add to our csproj to get rid of the problem?\r\n\r\nIt is a property that would need to be set in a .props/.targets file in your NuGet package. This would then set the property in consumer's projects.\r\n\r\n> Does it have any downsides/potential issues? \r\n\r\nThe only downside I can see is that when you aren't in a Maui or Blazor WASM app, and reference the EF package, you would get an extra property that is explicitly setting the value to `true` when the default is already `true` in server/desktop apps.\r\n\r\n> Any reason why this standard .NET feature isn't just available by default and needs this opt-in?\r\n\r\nIt is available by default in a lot of app models. It is just turned off in app models that are concerned with app size.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1048173310/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eerhardt","id":8291187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTExODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8291187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/eerhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eerhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1048589861","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/27474#issuecomment-1048589861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27474","id":1048589861,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs4-gDYl","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T09:28:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T09:28:02Z","body":"Thanks for the info @eerhardt, makes sense.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the intent here is to allow WASM/MAUI apps to reduce size, wouldn't it be better to allow EF Core to function properly when NullabilityInfoContextSupport is set to false?

https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/27099. I think changes like that would be much more impactful to backport to 6.0 if we were open to fixing the Maui experience. The reason being that #27099 is much harder to diagnose and workaround for the developer. This issue gives the developer a good error message and tells them exactly what to do to fix it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSet the MSBuild Property 'NullabilityInfoContextSupport' to true in order to enable it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout #27099 you get an error `$\"Could not find method '{name}' on type '{type}'\"`  deep in the EF
