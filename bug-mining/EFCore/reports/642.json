has full text support in preview ([docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/full-text-search)), and we've received a request to enable that from EF.\n\nImplementation-wise, this shouldn't be too different from the work we did for vector search for 9.0 (see #33783, #35074):\n\n* Allow modeling information for full-text search; this would set up the full-text policy/index when creating a new container.\n* Query translations for the full-text functions ([docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/full-text-search#full-text-search-queries)).\n    * ~One interesting idea: rather than providiing e.g. EF.Functions. FullTextContains, the user could simply use regular string Contains; if the referenced property is known to have a full-text index (from the model), we would implicitly translate that Contains to FullTextContains. But this needs to be checked (possibly with the Cosmos people): it would mean the user can no longer decide between regular [CONTAINS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/query/contains) and FullTextContains (is there any reason to use regular CONTAINS on a column which has a full-text index?).~\n        * This doesn't work, since full-text search does e.g. stemming, and .NET Contains should do bare character search.\n    * For FullTextContainsAll and FullTextContainsAny, we can decide to pattern-match the LINQ constructs `Where(x => tags.All(t => x.FullTextContains(t)))`, rather than introducing a direct overload. Though it's simpler - and maybe a bit more discoverable - for us to just provide the exact functions that Cosmos provides.     \n    * As part of this, translation support for [RRF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/query/rrf) should be done (hybrid search).\n","closed_by":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
