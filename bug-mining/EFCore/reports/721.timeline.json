regression in 10, because of the improvements to complex type handling.\n\nNow that complex property access is fully handled in all scenarios, we get the following query tree for translation:\n\n```c#\nDbSet<MyEntity>()\n    .Select(m => new { \n        Id = m.Id, \n        Combined = EF.Property<ComplexProp>(m, \"ComplexProperty\").Combined\n     })\n    .First()\n```\n\nBefore 10, the original `p.ComplexProperty.Combined` wasn't tranformed into EF.Property. Note that this transformation is standard in the query pipeline (e.g. for owned navigation properties, for primitive collections...). However, specifically for an unmapped property access over EF.Property, we go into client eval and invoke EF.Property client-side, which throws.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/3291097908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-15T09:39:33Z","updated_at":"2025-09-15T09:39:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/36785","id":3417131799,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPaMMs7LrUsX","number":36785,"title":"Consider

At some point, we started also transforming regular MemberExpressions - where a .NET property **does** exist - into EF.Property nodes, as a sort of \"universal representation\" of property access within the query pipeline.\n\n* EF.Property isn't client-evaluatable, so if a transformed EF.Property node ends up in client-evaluated code, the query fails. This is what happened in [#36761](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/36761).\n* EF.Property obfuscates the expression trees we show to users in exception messages. That is, the user wrote simple .NET code with property access, but they're presented with an odd EF.Property MethodCallExpression node instead.\n* EF.Property isn't universally used: in some cases we transform, in others we don't. So the value here is limited.\n* Such transformations are inherently problematic with NativeAOT/trimming, since we need to do MakeGenericType to create the node (though this problem exists in many

This causes query failure when an unmapped property access is composed on top.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nQueries accessing unmapped properties via complex properties now fail:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar v = await context.Entities\r\n    .Select(p => p.ComplexProperty.Unmapped)\r\n    .ToListAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer reported.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nYes\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nTest added\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow, affects mainly new code introduced in EF 10, and in any case only complex type support, which was very limited before 10 and so doesn't risk breaking many
