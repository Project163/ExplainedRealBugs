And it took me hours to narrow down what triggers the exception.\r\nIt turns out that when objects are nested in a specific pattern and with some uncertain property naming, the exception emerges. And the exception is specific to CosmosDb provider. It could be reproduced as ([.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/NUxQwr) is also available):\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\n\r\n// using var cxt = new SqlServerCxt(); // sql server provider is fine\r\n\r\nusing var cxt = new CosmosDbCxt();\r\n\r\ncxt.Find<EntityType1>(); // trigger building of the dbcontext\r\n\r\npublic class CosmosDbCxt : DbContext\r\n{\r\n    public DbSet<EntityType1> EntityType1 { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        optionsBuilder.UseCosmos( // you can stick with the fake values, the exception will be thrown prior to the connection\r\n            \"<edpt>\",\r\n            \"<key>\",\r\n            \"<dbName>\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<EntityType1>().Ignore(x => x.E2); // exception thrown here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// sql server provider is fine\r\n// public class SqlServerCxt : DbContext\r\n// {\r\n//     public DbSet<EntityType1> EntityType1 { get; set; }\r\n\r\n//     protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n//     {\r\n//         optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(\"Server=.\");\r\n//     }\r\n\r\n//     protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n//     {\r\n//         modelBuilder.Entity<EntityType1>().Ignore(x => x.E2);\r\n//     }\r\n// }\r\n\r\n\r\npublic class EntityType1\r\n{\r\n    public EntityType2 E2 { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\npublic class EntityType2\r\n{\r\n    public EntityType3 E3 { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public EntityType4 E4 { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class EntityType3\r\n{\r\n    public EntityType2 U2 { get; set; } // changing the property name here will either fix or break the issue, name like 'E2', 'A' is fine, but name like 'U2', 'Exy' is not.
