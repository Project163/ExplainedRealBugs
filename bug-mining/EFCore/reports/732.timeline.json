Since some databases (e.g. SQL Server) are case-insensitive, this causes the query to fail as it contains two parameters with the \"same\" name.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\nLINQ queries which involve two parameters that have the same name **except** for case differences fail.\r\n\r\n### How found\r\nCustomer reported.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\nYes, from 9.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nVery low, one-line targeted change to code already changed earlier in 10.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20135745905,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7P0yeOzwAAAASwLxlx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/20135745905","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"16d80df7aa018a12b439342d2c06da94eeb5e2cd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/16d80df7aa018a12b439342d2c06da94eeb5e2cd","created_at":"2025-10-07T08:59:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20135752527,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7P0yeOzwAAAASwLzNP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/20135752527","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"81bd171a6311f8e0d526f7f00e73577e85602300","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/81bd171a6311f8e0d526f7f00e73577e85602300","created_at":"2025-10-07T08:59:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20174049721,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7P0yeOzwAAAASyd5G5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/20174049721","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dea93f552733b432bc502440376af9719141829c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/dea93f552733b432bc502440376af9719141829c","created_at":"2025-10-08T23:38:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20181240002,"node_id":"CE_lADOAPaMMs7P0yeOzwAAAASy5UjC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/20181240002","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://
