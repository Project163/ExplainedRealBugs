is part of a bigger perf regression between EF8 and EF9: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/35053\n\nWhen processing LiftableConstantExpressions in the regular (non-AOT) mode we compile the resolver lambda and then evaluate it to get back the actual constant we plan to use. We do the compilation in the interpretation mode and that causes problems if the resulting object is itself (or contains) a delegate. Compiling into a delegate using interpreted mode, has impact on allocations as well as execution speed.\n\nbefore the fix (this already includes the invoke fix https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/35206)\n\n|      Method | Async |     Mean |   Error |  StdDev |  Op/s |       Gen0 |       Gen1 | Allocated |\n|------------ |------ |---------:|--------:|--------:|------:|-----------:|-----------:|----------:|\n| MultiInclue | False | 487.1 ms | 0.99 ms | 0.88 ms | 2.053 | 17000.0000 | 11000.0000 | 103.29 MB |\n| MultiInclue |  True | 487.4 ms | 3.63 ms | 3.22 ms | 2.052 | 17000.0000 | 11000.0000 | 103.29 MB |\n\nafter the fix\n\n|      Method | Async |     Mean |   Error |   StdDev |  Op/s |       Gen0 |      Gen1 | Allocated |\n|------------ |------ |---------:|--------:|---------:|------:|-----------:|----------:|----------:|\n| MultiInclue | False | 455.1 ms | 8.94 ms | 10.29 ms | 2.197 | 11000.0000 | 6000.0000 |  67.92 MB |\n| MultiInclue |  True | 435.4 ms | 1.77 ms |  1.66 ms | 2.297 | 11000.0000 | 6000.0000 |  67.92 MB |\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
