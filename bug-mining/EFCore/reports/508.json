The last statement on this was:\r\n\r\n> Executive architect decision: we'll default to the latest compatibility level (currently 160, SQL Server 2022). In any case, we don't expect to use any super-new feature which would block users with slightly older databases.\r\n\r\nBut then we did this #22924, which only works from level 160, which SQL Server 2022 or later. This means anyone updating to EF9 will need to either have SQL Server 2022, or set the compat level explicitly.\r\n\r\nInstead, we are changing our previous decision and making the default 150, or SQL Server 2019. This is not a breaking change because nothing generated by EF8 requires 160.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
