problem comes from the fact that the Id property is considered to be a key.\r\nIn case of JSON entity each property is either column access (in case of key - we project the key column and access value

In this case Id column is considered to be a key, so we try to access it based on index (which isn't there) and hence the bug.\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be a separate materialization bug, apart
