EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.HierarchyId 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nThis is the generated query:\r\n```sql\r\nDECLARE @__ids_0 nvarchar(4000) = N'[\"/1/\",\"/2/\"]';\r\n\r\nSELECT [s].[Id], [s].[Name]\r\nFROM

error:\r\n```\r\nCLR types cannot be used as column types in OPENJSON function with explicit schema.\r\nCLR types are not supported in WITH clause.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the type of `[value]` is changed from `hierarchyid` to `nvarchar(max)` on the last line implicit conversion kicks in and the command runs just fine with the new pattern.
