contains the following paragraph twice:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entity Framework Core does not support multiple parallel operations being run on the same DbContext instance. This includes both parallel execution of async queries and any explicit concurrent use from multiple threads. Therefore, always await async calls immediately, or use separate DbContext instances for operations that execute in parallel. See Avoiding DbContext threading issues for more information and examples._\r\n\n\n### Page URL\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.entityframeworkservicecollectionextensions.adddbcontext?view=efcore-8.0#microsoft-extensions-dependencyinjection-entityframeworkservicecollectionextensions-adddbcontext-1(microsoft-extensions-dependencyinjection-iservicecollection-system-action((microsoft-entityframeworkcore-dbcontextoptionsbuilder))-microsoft-extensions-dependencyinjection-servicelifetime-microsoft-extensions-dependencyinjection-servicelifetime)\n\n### Content source URL\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.ApiDocs/blob/live/dotnet/xml/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.xml\n\n### Document Version Independent Id\n\n29db4d36-3ab7-3eb9-ddb2-e5799f1f239a\n\n### Article author\n\n@dotnet-bot","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
