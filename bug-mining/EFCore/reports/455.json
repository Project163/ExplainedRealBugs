The hierarchical partitions are defined in the cosmos database, but I am struggling to work with them in EF when I have to specify HasPartitionKey method. I get an error that my partition specified does not match the partition defined in the document. Please assist on how I can work with hierarchical partitions in EF. See code below:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity(entity =>\r\n{\r\nentity.HasNoDiscriminator();\r\nentity.ToContainer((“Document”));\r\nentity.HasPartitionKey(x => new {x.ClientId , x.ProjectId} );\r\nentity.HasKey(x => new { x.id });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Include stack traces\r\n```\r\nSystem.ArgumentException: 'The expression 'x => new <>f__AnonymousType1`2(ClientId = x.ClientId, ProjectId = x.ProjectId)' is not a valid member access expression. The expression should represent a simple property or field access: 't => t.MyProperty'. (Parameter 'memberAccessExpression')'\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF Core version: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (6.0.5)\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos (6.0.5)\r\nTarget framework: NET 6.0\r\nIDE: Visual Studio 2022 \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28186/reactions","total_count":27,"+1":27,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
