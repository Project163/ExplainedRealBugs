This is a perf-critical piece of query infrastructure since it has to run for every query - parameter extraction must happen for each and every query separately.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation works as follows:\r\n\r\n* Visit the query tree to identify evaluatable nodes (EvaluatableExpressionFindingEV). This is a visitor which populates a dictionary with evaluatable nodes as keys, with the values being whether they should be parameterized or evaluated as constant.\r\n* Once this first pass is complete, ParameterExtractingEV visits the query tree again, and the moment it finds a node that's in the dictionary, evaluates it. This ensures that the top-most in an evaluatable subtree gets evaluated.\r\n\r\nAside from the double visitation, the population of the dictionary introduces a non-trivial overhead, inserting lots of nodes which won't be needed (only the top-most evaluatable in a given subtree is important).\r\n\r\nIt's possible to implement the same behavior in a single pass, simply bubbling up evaluatability information from the leaves and evaluating once we reach a node where not all children are evaluatable, but some are. The disadvantage compared to the current design, is that this would require specific logic to be coded for each node type (binary, method...), whereas the current visitor design is more generic (although in practice there are many exceptions/optimizations for specific node types).\r\n\r\nSince we are now working on supporting [precompiled queries](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/25009) via [.NET interceptors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-12#interceptors), we'll need the ParameterExtractingEV to produce code which extracts (evaluates) parameters from the tree (#32999); this requires specific logic for each node type anyway, in order to generate the path through the expression tree to the evaluatable fragment. At this point we can also implement the more efficient design as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T18:00:29Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T18:00:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29754","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29754/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29754/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29754/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29754","id":1474654426,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPaMMs5X5XDa","number":29754,"title":"[9.0]

For example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nIQueryable<Employee> allEmployees = context\r\n\t.Employees\r\n\t.Where(x => x.Department == \"Engineering\");\r\n\r\nEmployee[] result = allEmployees\r\n\t.Where(x => x.Salary > 1000)\r\n\t.Select(e => new {\r\n\t\tEmployee = e,\r\n\t\tTotalCount = allEmployees.Count()\r\n\t})\r\n\t.Skip(2).Take(10)\r\n\t.ToArray();\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduces:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ninfo: Executed DbCommand (16ms) [...]\r\n      SELECT COUNT(*)\r\n      FROM [Employees] AS [e]\r\n      WHERE [e].[Department] = N'Engineering'\r\n\r\ninfo: Executed DbCommand (26ms) [...]\r\n      SELECT [e].[Id], [e].[Department], [e].[Manager], [e].[Name], [e].[Salary], @__Count_0 AS [TotalCount]\r\n      FROM [Employees] AS [e]\r\n      WHERE [e].[Department] = N'Engineering' AND [e].[Salary] > 1000.0\r\n      ORDER BY (SELECT 1)\r\n      OFFSET @__p_1 ROWS FETCH NEXT @__p_2 ROWS ONLY\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan I somehow force EF to combine these two queries into one (which is what I expect as a developer when I write the above query):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n      SELECT [e].[Id], [e].[Department], [e].[Manager], [e].[Name], [e].[Salary], (\r\n             SELECT COUNT(*)\r\n             FROM [Employees] AS [e]\r\n             WHERE [e].[Department] = N'Engineering') AS [TotalCount]\r\n      FROM [Employees] AS [e]\r\n      WHERE [e].[Department] = N'Engineering' AND [e].[Salary] > 1000.0\r\n      ORDER BY (SELECT 1)\r\n      OFFSET @__p_1 ROWS FETCH NEXT @__p_2 ROWS ONLY\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my real application the query is quite complex (with filters and DISTINCTs) and it is measurable faster to combine the two (I guess because SQL Server can reuse quite some intermediate query results). But there might also be other reasons, why developers want to combine the two queries, for example if there are hard consistency requirements.\r\n\r\nHere is a [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/rVnLzy) with full

This will be used when generating precompiled query interceptors in order to generate code that extracts the parameterizable nodes and evaluates them at runtime.\r\n* To support this, the new funcletizer has a visitation method for each node type (that's required for generating the correct path through each node). This is different from the previous approach, where the same semi-generic code attempted to handle the work for all node types (but in practice there were many exceptions and special code paths for specific node types).\r\n* In addition, the new funcletizer does its work in a single visitation pass; the old approach was to visit once to identify evaluatable nodes, and then to visit again and evaluate the top-level nodes. This is better for perf.\r\n\r\nCloses #32999\r\nCloses #32698\r\nCloses
