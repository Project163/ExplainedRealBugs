First thing is delimiting the path (when necessary), as @perfectphase suggested. Another thing is escaping non-standard characters. \r\n\r\nWe use `Utf8JsonWriter` to build JSON that ultimately gets send to the database. The following property:\r\n`Number-=[]\\\\;,./~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:\\\"<>?独角兽π獨角獸  `\r\ngets saved as:\r\n`Number\\u0060-=[]\\\\;\\u0027,./~!@#$%^\\u0026*()_\\u002B{}|:\\u0022\\u003C\\u003E?\\u72EC\\u89D2\\u517D\\u03C0\\u7368\\u89D2\\u7378`\r\n\r\nWhen building JSON path in our query we need to match this, otherwise `JSON_VALUE` or `JSON_QUERY` won't return the correct data. \r\n\r\nThird aspect in in the shaper code. We use  `Utf8JsonReader` to read JSON stream and populate entities with correct values. Code that reads values looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nLoop(Break: done Continue: )\r\n                        {\r\n                            {\r\n                                tokenType = jsonReaderManager.MoveNext();\r\n                                switch (tokenType)\r\n                                {\r\n                                    case PropertyName: \r\n                                        jsonReaderManager.CurrentReader.ValueTextEquals([LIFTABLE Constant: Number\\u0060-=[]\\\\;\\u0027,./~!@#$%^\\u0026*()_\\u002B{}|:\\u0022\\u003C\\u003E?\\u72EC\\u89D2\\u517D\\u03C0\\u7368\\u89D2\\u7378 | Resolver: _ => (object)JsonEncodedText.Encode(\r\n                                                value: \"Number`-=[]\\;',./~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:\"<>?独角兽π獨角獸\", \r\n                                                encoder: default(JavaScriptEncoder))].EncodedUtf8Bytes)) ? \r\n                                        {\r\n                                            jsonReaderManager.MoveNext();\r\n                                            namelessParameter{6} = (int)[LIFTABLE Constant: JsonInt32ReaderWriter | Resolver: c => c.Dependencies.Model.FindEntityType(\"AdHocJsonQueryTestBase+Context33443+JsonEntity\").FindProperty(\"Number\").GetJsonValueReaderWriter() ?? c.Dependencies.Model.FindEntityType(\"AdHocJsonQueryTestBase+Context33443+JsonEntity\").FindProperty(\"Number\").GetTypeMapping().JsonValueReaderWriter].FromJsonTyped(\r\n                                                manager: jsonReaderManager, \r\n                                                existingObject: default(object));\r\n                                        } : default(void)\r\n                                    case EndObject: \r\n                                        Goto(break done)\r\n                                    default: \r\n                                        {\r\n                                            jsonReaderManager.Skip();\r\n                                        }\r\n                                }\r\n                            }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nproblem is that `ValueTextEquals` \"un-escapes\" characters in the JSON before comparison, so we never match here. We could pass unescaped property name - I tried `UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping` and it wasn't good enough. Perhaps we can create a JavaScriptEncoder with custom ranges taking all the unicode chars? Alternatively, we could use `MemoryExtensions.SequenceEqual(ReadOnlySpan<byte>, ReadOnlySpan<byte>)`  which compares the value as-they-are, so our escaped string is matching just fine.\r\n\r\n@roji
