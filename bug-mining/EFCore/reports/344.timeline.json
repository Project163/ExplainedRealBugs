with certain names. For instance, I can change the name of either the 'Properties' or 'AttributesByCategory' table and it will scaffold successfully.\r\n\r\nHowever, again there seem to be certain strings that cause it to throw the NRE that I was getting up above.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples. One thing to note, I change the name of the table directly from the database diagram in the properties window and then make sure to save the database diagram to ensure that changes take affect and the all existing relationship and references are maintained. Also, I know that some of the FKs still have their old names. I was trying to recreate the issue in the smallest form possible. I renamed many of the tables and the PKs during this process and then scaffolded after each change to see what would happen. This is what I am able to get to either succeed or fail consistently.\r\n\r\n1) Change 'Properties' to 'Property' -> Fail\r\n```\r\nPM> Scaffold-DBContext 'Name=ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection'

Server (I have tried this with SQL Express Version 16.0.1000, SQL Server Enterprise Version 14.0.3421.10, and Azure SQL Server Version 12.0.2000.8 and get the same error on all versions of SQL Server)\r\n2) Create the required tables in this order, to prevent issues with FK constraints. As mentioned above, I know that many of the FKs still have their old names. I am also aware that the Unique Non-Clustered Index on the \"Properties\" table looks weird since it is on IdA and IdC, but the primary Key is on IdA, IdB, and IdC. This is by design and is part of the larger DB structure that is required. Only leaving it in here as this is the simplest version of the DB that I have been able to reproduce the error with. I stopped short of check if the constraints or FK were causing the issue once I discovered that renaming the \"Properties\" table fixed the issue.\r\n\r\n2.1) TableC\r\n```sql\r\n/****** Object:

\"Create a New Project\"\r\n5) Select the \"ASP.NET Core Web API\" template\r\n6) Set the framework to .NET 8.0\r\n-Leave the Authentication type as \"None\"\r\n-Keep \"Configure for HTTPS\" checked\r\n-Leave \"Enable Docker\" unchecked\r\n-Keep \"Enable for OpenAPI support\" checked\r\n-Leave \"Do not use top-level statements\" unchecked\r\n-Keep \"Use Controllers\" checked\r\n7) Install the following NuGet packages:\r\n-Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 8.0.0\r\n-Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design 8.0.0\r\n-Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 8.0.0\r\n-Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools 8.0.0\r\n\r\nThis is what my .csproj file looks like after installing all of the packages.\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\r\n

note, you will likely need to override the \"Invariant Globalization\" setting in the .csproj file to \"false\", as seen above, otherwise you may get the following error when you try and run the

If you then go into the database diagram and change the name of the \"Properties\" table to \"ABCProp\", save the database and then try to run the PMC command again, the scaffold should succeed.\r\n\r\nOne final thing, if you follow the exact same instructions as above for the ASP.NET Core Web API, but set it up for .NET 6.0 and install all of the same NuGet packages as above in version 6.0.0, the scaffold command will succeed without changing the name of the tables in the DB. This seems to be a breaking change with EF Core 7 and 8. \r\n\r\nIf this can't be fixed to allow all tables names, it would at least be nice to have a list of table names that will break EF Core and/or instead of throwing an NRE, at least display the affected table names that need to be changed in the stack trace.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if I can provide any other assistance on this error. I tried to be as thorough as possible when explaining what cause the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 8.0.0\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget
