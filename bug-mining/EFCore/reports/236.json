don't currently allow composing LINQ operators over collections within JSON documents, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nctx.Entity.Where(e => e.JsonThing.Track.Segments.Any(s => s.HR > 130)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the JSONPATH language was created for this purpose, support for it is very limited across databases, with the exception of PostgreSQL ([see docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH)).\r\n\r\nHowever, databases do provide ways of converting JSON arrays to a standard relational rowset, which can then be queried via usual SQL operators. We've already implemented support for these mechanisms (OPENJSON on SQL Server, json_each on SQLite) as part of primitive collections (#30426); we could extend that support to also work for non-primitive collections within JSON.\r\n\r\nOriginally suggested in https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/4021#issuecomment-1033896410","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28616/reactions","total_count":197,"+1":171,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":14,"rocket":0,"eyes":12},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
