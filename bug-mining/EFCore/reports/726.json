a query compares two complex types for equality, we generate equality checks for all of their simple properties (mapped to columns), recursively. However, when comparing to a parameter or inline representation (not a column), the properties on the parameter/constant complex type get the default type mapping, instead of getting inferred from the other side of the comparison as usual. This means that comparing a property with a non-default type mapping - e.g. a DateTime mapped to SQL Server `datetime` instead of the default `datetime2` - the default representation would be generated (`datetime2`) and the comparison would fail.\n\nThis bug was discovered while porting the PostgreSQL provider to use the latest 10.0, and is quite blocking.","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
