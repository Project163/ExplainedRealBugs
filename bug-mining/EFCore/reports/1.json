we use our GetRequiredRuntimeMethod wrapper method, the linker cannot see our dependency on on Math (e.g. in SqlServerMathTranslator); this is a regression from EF Core 5.0, where at least basic query usage does work with .NET SDK 6.0.\r\n\r\nThe proper fix for this in 7.0 is to stop using GetRequiredRuntimeMethod (tracked by #26288), but for 6.0 we can do a simpler, less risky change that would make the dependency known to the linker. Other scenarios may very well fail since EF Core 6.0 isn't trimming-ready.\r\n\r\nReported e.g. in https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/2185","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
