To achieve this we have surrounded everything in a transaction during the migration.  \nWith EF8 this worked well, but with EF9 we're getting the exception `System.NotSupportedException: 'User transaction is not supported with a TransactionSuppressed migrations or a retrying execution strategy.`'\n\nWe found the related(?) issue https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/35096 but I can't apply the solution in it since it doesn't fail at a `.Sql()` call.\nAnd we're at least not changing any retrying strategy and I'm not sure how to disable it if it is enabled.\n\n### Minimal repo:\nAdd

The common scenario is to add a new migration, then update the database to the latest migration. But it is easy to forget adding a new migration after the model was changed. So, in 9.0 we added a runtime warning that would throw by default when updating the database if there are any changes detected in the model that aren't reflected in the latest migration.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are several reasons why the migrations could be out-of-date and the exception message was not helpful for some of the users. This PR adds more specific messages and makes the warning to be logged instead of throwing for some cases:\r\n\r\n1. There are no migrations at all. This is common when the database is updated through other means. The exception will not be thrown.\r\n2. There are some migrations, but the model snapshot is missing. This is common for migrations added manually. The exception will not be thrown.\r\n3. The model wasn't modified by the developer, but it's built in a non-deterministic way causing EF to detect it as modified. This is common when `new DateTime()` or `Guid.NewGuid()` are used in seed data. The exception will still be thrown.\r\n4. For other cases the exception will still be thrown.\r\n\r\nWe will also add documentation explaining the above.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade some applications that were working correctly started crashing on startup. This was by-design, but the required action from the developer wasn't clear. The workaround is to ignore the warning using options.\r\n\r\n### How found\r\n\r\nMultiple customer reports on 9.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nYes, from 8.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTests added.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35221/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
