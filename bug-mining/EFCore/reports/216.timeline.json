All proposed solutions are to serialize the collection but this does not allow for querying it's content easily or to create a class with a single property to represent the new table.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the solution you'd like -->\r\nThrough configuration it would be great to be able to define a table assigned to the collection so that it can be stored in it's own table with a foreign key referencing the parent entity. This could be configured like a collection of owned entities stored in it's own table where the value of the collection is the only column (with the foreign key).\r\n\r\nSo the entity:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Role\r\n{\r\n  public string Id { get; set; }\r\n  public string Name { get; set; }\r\n  public ICollection<string> Members { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the following configuration:\r\n```csharp\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Role>().OwnsMany(\r\n    r => r.Members, \r\n    b => {\r\n        b.ToTable(\"RoleMembers\");\r\n        b.WithOwner().HasForeignKey(\"RoleId\");\r\n        b.Property(b => b).HasColumnName(\"Name\");\r\n        b.HasKey(\"RoleId\", \"Name\");\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be persisted in 2 tables:\r\n- Roles\r\n  - Id\r\n  - Name\r\n- RoleMembers\r\n  - RoleId\r\n  - Name

Why add extra characters to denote that the data holds an array and have escaping quotes around values when the commas are all that is needed to delineate them?\r\n\r\nFor one thing, at least for some values (e.g. strings), quoting is just as much a problem for CSV encoding as for JSON. For example, try to use STRING_SPLIT to do querying over a CSV field which does require quoting (because e.g. a comma is present in one of the values) - that's not likely to work well. The point is that JSON is a format that's already recognized and somewhat well-supported by the database, so in that sense it's a superior option to CSV.\r\n\r\nThe extra characters for quoting are unlikely to make a meaningful difference in real-world scenarios.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1354752747/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1354864887","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29427#issuecomment-1354864887","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29427","id":1354864887,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5QwZj3","user":{"login":"marchy","id":1369360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjkzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1369360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy","html_url":"https://github.com/marchy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marchy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-16T14:02:31Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T14:02:31Z","body":"In what scenarios does quoting actually come into play though?\r\n\r\nI would imagine this would only be for user-inputted values, in which case you would likely configure it to be its own separate related table (https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/25163) as your value-set is going to grow with your userbase (ie: multi-tenancy scenarios) and likely include more complex data structures than a simple primitive value (ie: you'll at least have a Name and a Rank/Order column).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n<img width=\"472\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 8 54 49 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1369360/208113468-be78aec8-23bd-48a1-b61a-cddd7281c153.png\">\r\n\r\nIf you have this scenario you would NOT be leveraging a collection of simple primitive types to model it.\r\n\r\nOn the flip-side, here's an example of where we do use non-user-inputted tagging/categorization in practice: \r\n<img width=\"2006\" alt=\"Column tagging\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1369360/208112001-6ee9088a-a245-4546-92e7-8651e1c35215.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of those columns are arrays of pre-defined, semantic, well-defined enums.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to DB, I would argue perf and storage optimization matter MOST – that's why DBs are DBs and we use ORMs to abstract and make it human-centric for developers to work with and hide away the serialization optimization concerns.

Not to mention performance: the cost of doing an extra JOIN because you've decided to put your value list in another table is likely to be significantly more than the overhead of the quoting characters in a JSON document.\r\n\r\nI certainly don't think storing lists of arbitrary strings (which may contain commas) is a once-in-a-blue-moon scenario. I also think that before prematurely optimizing for the scenario where there are no commas, we'd want to see some hard proof that JSON really is significantly slower than CSV here - which I doubt.\r\n\r\nBottom line, I don't think we'd want the *default* mapping strategy for primitive collections to be something that breaks down as soon as you stick a comma in one of the values.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1354907412/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
