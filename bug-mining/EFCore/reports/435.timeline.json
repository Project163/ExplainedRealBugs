More details of the full scope of Cosmos work over several releases can be found in _All work_ section below.\r\n\r\n> Important: This plan is not a commitment; it will evolve as we continue to learn throughout the release. Some things not currently planned for EF9 may get pulled in. Some things currently planned for EF9 may get punted out.\r\n\r\nThe general approach for Cosmos in EF9 is:\r\n\r\n- Necessary infrastructure/test work\r\n- Bring the query pipeline up-to-date with relational\r\n- As much as possible in parallel, implement high-value enhancements\r\n  - Bring complex types support close to relational level\r\n  - Small config items, like RBAC\r\n  - High-value smaller query items\r\n- Depending on how this work goes, stretch goals are:\r\n  - Better use of partition keys (Will do if query is in good shape in time.)\r\n  - Partial updates and CUD batching\r\n\r\n## Completed\r\n\r\n### General improvements\r\n\r\n- #32563\r\n- #19814\r\n- #4179\r\n- #32197\r\n- #28186\r\n- #28265\r\n- #33535\r\n- #33881\r\n- #24202\r\n- #29177\r\n- #24513\r\n- #33783\r\n- #34053\r\n- #26239\r\n- #34180\r\n- #34005\r\n- #34176\r\n- #34179\r\n- #34269\r\n\r\n### Query fundamentals\r\n- #34068\r\n- #33032\r\n- #25364 \r\n- #25765\r\n- #16926\r\n  - #17957\r\n- #33032\r\n- #33905\r\n- #25701\r\n- #25700\r\n- #29497\r\n- #16146\r\n- #20441\r\n- #33858\r\n- #33797\r\n- #33894\r\n- #34123\r\n\r\n### Function translations\r\n- #17722 \r\n- #33904\r\n- #25250\r\n- #33975\r\n\r\n### ReadItem and partition key management\r\n- #20350 \r\n- #20693\r\n- #34085\r\n- #33960\r\n- #34102\r\n\r\n### Infra/internal work\r\n- #32647\r\n- #31063\r\n- #33898\r\n- #34092\r\n\r\n## Planned\r\n\r\nNo more planned work for 9 at this time.\r\n\r\n## Punted\r\n\r\n- #34067\r\n- #34027\r\n- #12878\r\n- #25548\r\n- #34026\r\n- #33893\r\n\r\n## Stretch\r\n\r\n- #33968\r\n- #31253\r\n  - There is a lot of scope here; some of it will be heavily query dependent.

For example, `SelectMany` is a fundamental query pattern that should work on any EF Core provider. Similarly, partition keys are fundamental to working with Cosmos, and hence EF must expose/provide this functionality.\r\n\r\n## Query fundamentals\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing (beginning of EF9 work), the Cosmos query pipeline code has fallen behind the relational code by a considerable about. The architecture now employed by relational providers must be ported to Cosmos before any other major changes are made to the query pipeline.\r\n\r\n- #33032 (X-Large)\r\n\r\nFollowing this, some fundamental improvements are needed to the query pipeline. Many of these areas have model building, change tracking, update pipeline aspects as well, but they involve a lot of query work.\r\n\r\n- #20350 (Medium)\r\n  - #24087\r\n  - #24202 (Large)\r\n- #17722 (Small)\r\n- #24513 (Medium)\r\n- Collections of primitive, complex, and entity types.
