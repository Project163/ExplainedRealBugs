using EFCore 7.\r\n\r\nI have a ef core model likes below, the column `Address` that allows json string or null:\r\n```csharp\r\n  modelBuilder.Entity<User>(e =>\r\n  {\r\n      e.OwnsOne(p => p.Address, b => b.ToJson());\r\n  });\r\n\r\npublic partial class User\r\n{\r\n    [StringLength(50)]\r\n    [Unicode(false)]\r\n    public string Name { get; set; } = null!;\r\n    ...\r\n    public UserAddress? Address { get; set; } = null!;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I faced two questions:\r\n\r\n1. When I executed the query likes below:\r\n```csharp\r\n_labDBContext.Users.Select(x => new Model_User()\r\n{\r\n    Name = x.Name,\r\n     ...\r\n    UserAddress = x.Address\r\n}).ToList();\r\n```\r\nI would get error message `variable '' of type 'IScom_Test_API.Models.DBModels.LabDB.UserAddress' referenced from scope '', but it is not defined`\r\n\r\nbut if I change to the code as below, it will work as expected:\r\n```csharp\r\n_labDBContext.Users.Select(x => new Model_User()\r\n{\r\n    Name = x.Name,\r\n     ...\r\n    UserAddress = new()\r\n    {\r\n        City = x.Address.City,\r\n        Country = x.Address.Country\r\n    }\r\n}).ToList();\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure if there's any problem or limitation about EFCore's `Select` function or not?\r\n\r\n2. And I have another code as below, the same, want to select or filter the IQuerable variable with a json column `Address`:\r\n```csharp\r\n_labDBContext.Users.Where(x => x.Address == null).ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll also return the errors, \r\n`Error creating query string: The LINQ expression 'DbSet<User>()\r\n    .Where(u => EF.Property<UserAddress>(u, \"Address\") == null)' could not be translated. Either rewrite the query in a form that can be translated, or switch to client evaluation explicitly by inserting a call to 'AsEnumerable', 'AsAsyncEnumerable', 'ToList', or 'ToListAsync'. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2101038 for more information..`\r\n    \r\nI think the reasons that caused the two questions are similar, does anyone knows why would it  cause error if I want to manipulate a json column?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30589/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
