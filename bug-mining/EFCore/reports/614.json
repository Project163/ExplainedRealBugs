Description:**\nHello EF Core team,\n\nI've encountered what seems to be a bug in EF Core 9. When I perform a **GroupJoin** between two tables using a condition that always evaluates to true (for example, `c => true` and `p => true`), the resulting joined collection is always null, even though there are valid entries in the related table. Here is minimal reproducible example:\n\n```csharp\nvar query = context.Categories\n    .GroupJoin(context.Products,\n               c => true,\n               p => true,\n               (c, p) => new \n               { \n                   Category = c, \n                   Products = p \n               })\n    .Select(s => new\n    {\n        CategoryName = s.Category.CategoryName,\n        Products = s.Products\n    })\n    .ToList();\n```\n\nIn this scenario, s.Products always comes back as empty (null), However, if I rewrite this using a from clause (or a manual join with `on 1 equals 1`), I get the expected results:\n\n```csharp\nvar query2 = \n    (from c in context.Categories\n     join p in context.Products \n         on 1 equals 1\n         into productGroup\n     select new\n     {\n         CategoryName = c.CategoryName,\n         Products = productGroup\n     })\n    .ToList();\n```\n\nBoth of these queries should logically produce the same result, but the **GroupJoin** version returns null for the `Products` while the LINQ from version successfully includes the product collection. If this is not intended behavior, it seems like a bug.\n\nThank you for looking into this! If you need any further information I'm happy to provide more details.","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35393/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
