the query pipeilne, we pattern match specific LINQ operators to translate to specialized functions/operators. For example, on SQLite, the query fragment `Where(b => b.Ints.Count() == 8)` is translated to `json_array_length(b.Ints) = 8`, rather than the full subquery translation (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM json_each(b.Ints)) == 8`).\n\nUnfortunately, in many of the sites where this sort of pattern matching occurs, I left out checking the predicate. As a result, we perform these simplifications even when we shouldn't. For example, `Where(b => b.Ints.Where(i => i > 3).Count() == 8)` also translates to `json_array_length(b.Ints) = 8`, effectively ignoring the Where().\n\nCorresponding issue for PG: https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/3195","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
