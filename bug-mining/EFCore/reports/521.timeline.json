We just need the SqlDbType value from the BCL.\r\n- [x] SqlDbType.Json is being exposed in the runtime for .NET 9.0 ([issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/103925)). EF will presumably need to use that to specify to SqlClient to send the new JSON type.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement type mapping support for mapping .NET string to the new json type.\r\n- [x] Allow users to map primitive collections to the new JSON type (by explicitly configuring the column type - we'll consider switching the default later).\r\n- [x] #28452 (to allow users to map owned entity types to the new JSON type).\r\n- [x] Test-wise, we'd ideally duplicate the PrimitiveCollections and other JSON-related tests to also execute when configured with json. Though note that the JSON type is currently only available in SQL Azure, and we don't currently test against it, as there's no local emulator version. \r\n\r\n/cc @saurabh500
