The logger has references ultimately leading to the EF change tracker and through it, meaning that these user objects are kept alive forever (a form of leak).\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nWith specific usage, arbitrary large user objects may be kept alive forever, and never garbage-collected. In addition, the wrong query logger instance may get used (the one from when the query was first compiled, instead of the current one for the query being executed), which could lead to incorrect logging.\r\n\r\nWe have performed patch servicing for this kind of bug before (because of the leak potential).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer report\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nYes, from EF 7 to EF 8; introduced in #31100.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThis is unfortunately difficult/possible to test automatically, as it's about an unwanted reference in the shaper keeping objects alive. Tested manually to ensure that the shaper no longer contains the reference.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. The change is simple, and we have ample code coverage for the affected codepaths.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19656240604,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASTmm3c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19656240604","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-12T09:24:12Z","label":{"name":"Servicing-consider","color":"bfd4f2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19669706934,"node_id":"CE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASUZ-i2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19669706934","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-12T21:48:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19669706936,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASUZ-i4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19669706936","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b7996bea1566d1afd3f8c0fe9226b6c3c6b19d32","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/b7996bea1566d1afd3f8c0fe9226b6c3c6b19d32","created_at":"2025-09-12T21:48:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/3286942535","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/36464#issuecomment-3286942535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36464","id":3286942535,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs7D6sNH","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","e

The logger has references ultimately leading to the EF change tracker and through it, meaning that these user objects are kept alive forever (a form of leak).\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nWith specific usage, arbitrary large user objects may be kept alive forever, and never garbage-collected. In addition, the wrong query logger instance may get used (the one from when the query was first compiled, instead of the current one for the query being executed), which could lead to incorrect logging.\r\n\r\nWe have performed patch servicing for this kind of bug before (because of the leak potential).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer report\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nYes, from EF 7 to EF 8; introduced in #31100.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThis is unfortunately difficult/possible to test automatically, as it's about an unwanted reference in the shaper keeping objects alive. Tested manually to ensure that the shaper no longer contains the reference.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. The change is simple, and we have ample code coverage for the affected codepaths; quirk added.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19683808424,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASVPxSo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19683808424","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e15a3a4bbc3b528c54b390a2adfd48d335dfc2d2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/e15a3a4bbc3b528c54b390a2adfd48d335dfc2d2","created_at":"2025-09-14T07:42:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-14T07:43:12Z","updated_at":"2025-09-14T07:43:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36779","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36779/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36779/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36779/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36779","id":3414707525,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAPaMMs6od9S8","number":36779,"title":"[8.0]

The logger has references ultimately leading to the EF change tracker and through it, meaning that these user objects are kept alive forever (a form of leak).\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nWith specific usage, arbitrary large user objects may be kept alive forever, and never garbage-collected. In addition, the wrong query logger instance may get used (the one from when the query was first compiled, instead of the current one for the query being executed), which could lead to incorrect logging.\r\n\r\nWe have performed patch servicing for this kind of bug before (because of the leak potential).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer report\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nYes, from EF 7 to EF 8; introduced in #31100.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThis is unfortunately difficult/possible to test automatically, as it's about an unwanted reference in the shaper keeping objects alive. Tested manually to ensure that the shaper no longer contains the reference.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. The change is simple, and we have ample code coverage for the affected codepaths; quirk added.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19686631633,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASVaijR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19686631633","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-14T16:49:04Z","label":{"name":"Servicing-consider","color":"bfd4f2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19686631636,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASVaijU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19686631636","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-14T16:49:04Z","label":{"name":"Servicing-approved","color":"048708"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19693743495,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASV1q2H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19693743495","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d574040e7327b8f84a80fd5baa6e450c4658fc37","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/d574040e7327b8f84a80fd5baa6e450c4658fc37","created_at":"2025-09-15T07:06:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19693746272,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7DLSvSzwAAAASV1rhg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19693746272","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.git
