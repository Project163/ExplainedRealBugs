We already made that check when mapping to views.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\n\r\nWhen customer maps JSON entity to a different table/view than it's owner we throw a meaningless exception (sequence contains no elements).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\n\r\nMultiple customer reports on 7.0\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\n\r\nNo. JSON has been added in 7.0\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nAdded validation tests for affected scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nVery low: Fix just adds validation step which throws a better exception message for a negative scenario (that used to throw bad exception before).
