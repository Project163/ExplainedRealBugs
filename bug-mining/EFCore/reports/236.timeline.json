I'm going to try to write a simple example\r\n\r\nModel:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n\tpublic class User\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic Guid Id { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic string Name { get; set; }\r\n\t\t//Other properties\r\n\t\tpublic List<Comments> Comments { get; set; }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic class Comments\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic Guid UserId { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic string UserName { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic string Message { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic DateTimeOffset Date { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic CommentType CommentType { get; set; }\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n\tprotected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tmodelBuilder.Entity<User>(u =>\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tu.ToTable(\"User\");\r\n\t\t\tu.HasKey(x => x.Id);\r\n\t\t\t//More properties configuration\r\n\t\t\tu.OwnsMany(c => c.Comments, ownedType =>\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\townedType.Property(d => d.CommentType)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.HasConversion(new EnumToNumberConverter<CommentType, int>());\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\townedType.ToJson();\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuery:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n\tvar usersWithComments = await _dbContext.Users\r\n\t\t.Where(u => u.Comments.Any())\r\n\t\t.Select(u => u.Id)\r\n\t\t.ToListAsync(cancellationToken);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOften I ended up getting an exception similar of those:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe LINQ expression 'DbSet<Users>()\r\n\t.Where(d => EF.Property<List<Comments>>(d, \"Comments\")\r\n\t\t.AsQueryable()\r\n\t\t.Any())' could not be translated. Either rewrite the query in a form that can be translated, or switch to client evaluation explicitly by inserting a call to 'AsEnumerable', 'AsAsyncEnumerable', 'ToList', or 'ToListAsync'. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2101038 for more information.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `List<Comments> Comments` should be stored in the database as a serialized Json column in the User's table\r\nHere is an example of the json:\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"UserId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\r\n    \"UserName\": \"Test1\",\r\n    \"Message\": \"User comment test\",\r\n    \"Date\": \"2022-11-24T10:00:00.0000000-00:00\",\r\n    \"CommentType\": 0\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"UserId\": \"11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111\",\r\n    \"UserName\": \"Test2\",\r\n    \"Message\": \"Adm comment test.\",\r\n    \"Date\": \"2022-11-25T08:00:00.00000000-00:00\",\r\n    \"CommentType\": 1\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure if it's currently a limitation or if I'm just missing some configuration.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29677/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-25T08:40:06Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T08:40:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30132","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30132/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30132/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30132/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30132","id":1555541442,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPaMMs5ct63C","number":30132,"title":"Query
