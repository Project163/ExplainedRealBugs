However we process this scenario as if \"regular\" code path was being executed. Basically, we would generate code for collection projection outside of `resultContext.Values == null` block (this needs to happen for regular collections due to result coordination). For JSON it's not needed, because entire object is loaded from a single row. So we can move the processing into the block and then just refer to it's product in the final projection. We also need to shuffle around the order in which we build the block. We should build expressions and json entities first, then populate resultContext and then build includes (which depend on values in the context). Before we were populating result values before we generated json entities, (which didn't matter because we were not using that info) but now is necessary.\r\n\r\nFixes

Workaround exists but it's not very discoverable and requires query rewrite (project entire entity and bring back the requested collection by applying include beforehand).\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\n\r\nQueries with affected entities throw during compilation.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\n\r\nMultiple customer reports on 7.0\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\n\r\nNo. JSON support is new functionality in 7.0.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nAdded regression tests for affected scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow: While scenario is quite common, the fix is isolated to only affecting the scenario (i.e. when entity collection is projected along with json entity/collection). Moreover, fix is to apply the same logic that we use for non-JSON entity scenarios, so we have good degree of confidence that the logic is sound.\r\n\r\nThose two issues are very closely related. Initially we thought that fix for #30565 would be significantly more risky/complex, so we split the bugs apart, but we were able to find a better fix that is only marginally more risky than #30266 and the resulting risk for combined issue is still low.\r\n\r\nAdded quirk to revert to old behavior if necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8917340672,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5hqKz6zwAAAAITg9IA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8917340672","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"432bed3871b2e5111a02c3532c1d58c74a685674","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/432bed3871b2e5111a02c3532c1d58c74a685674","created_at":"2023-04-03T20:59:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8937814024,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5hqKz6zwAAAAIUvDgI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8937814024","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e1aacd81da9d7aaeccfa78ebe815f9f8f62df141","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/e1aacd81da9d7aaeccfa78ebe815f9f8f62df141","created_at":"2023-04-05T17:45:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8937817328,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAPaMMs5hqKz6zwAAAAIUvETw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8937817328","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-05T17:45:44Z","label":{"name":"Servicing-consider","color":"bfd4f2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8937817338,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5hqKz6zwAAAAIUvET6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8937817338","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptio

For example, consider this table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE [Members] (\r\n    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,\r\n    [Name] nvarchar(max) NULL,\r\n    [IsActive] bit NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST(1 AS bit),\r\n    CONSTRAINT [PK_Member] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF8 now parses literal values in column default constraints, allowing `HasDefaultValue` to be scaffolded instead of `HasDefaultValyeSql`. For example, `CAST(1 AS bit)` is parsed as `true`:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Member>(entity =>\r\n{\r\n    entity.Property(e => e.IsActive).HasDefaultValue(true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF checks the value of a property to determine whether or not to let the database generate a value. Starting with EF8, [this check can be customized](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/701). This means that EF8 will send `false` to the database when needed, since database default is known to be `true`. \r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n- Major progress on value objects with the merge of [_Add complex types to Metadata_](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31003).\r\n- A PR with changes to JSON serialization is [out for review](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31160)\r\n- Unfortunately, the [T4 tooling changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/plan#first-class-t4-templates-in-visual-studio) planned for Visual Studio have been cut.\r\n\r\n## EF Core 8 (EF8)\r\n\r\nEF Core 8 (EF8) will be the next release after EF Core 7.0. It will be released alongside .NET 8 in November 2023.\r\n\r\nThe [EF Core 8 Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/plan) is available publicly in our documentation. As always, [feedback is greatly appreciated](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29853).
