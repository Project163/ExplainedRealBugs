Note that the provider doesn't yet support creating virtual tables in migrations (but can still be used to update tables created externally/via raw SQL).\r\n\r\nWe can add metadata about virtual tables, which would trigger opting out of RETURNING. We can also add a general context option to opt out of it, which would be an escape hatch for any further incompatibility scenarios.\r\n\r\nNote that we already automatically opt out of RETURNING for old versions of SQLite (#28911).\r\n\r\nThanks @JesperTreetop for reporting this in

change in v7.0.0 to use the SQLite RETURNING clause during updates, as opposed to the extra SELECT statement in v6.x, means that @bricelam's concurrency strategy for SQLite https://www.bricelam.net/2020/08/07/sqlite-and-efcore-concurrency-tokens.html no longer works when making multiple saves from an existing context.\r\n\r\nThough the theory of using RETURNING to avoid an extra round-trip is great, the current SQLite implementation: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_returning.html#limitations_and_caveats means that RETURNING does not return any values generated by an AFTER trigger and as a result concurrency checks fail when making subsequent `SaveChangesAsync` calls from an existing context.\r\n\r\nThis issue only really arises if you are making multiple calls to `SaveChangesAsync` for the same context, and hence wouldn't arise if you use a new context each time but we are hitting it when doing batch imports where we re-use the context for performance optimisation.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, this is not a bug in EF Core, it's merely that a side-effect of the change in EF Core behaviour causes an edge-case to fail because of a current limitation in the SQLite implementation of RETURNING.\r\n\r\nI think the best strategy at the moment would be if there was the ability to opt out of the new SQLite update behaviour as suggested by #29512 - hence the feature request.\r\n \r\nWe have found a workaround for this particular issue by using a `SaveChangesInterceptor` whereby we update the version counter in the context before persistence, but I would prefer to use a trigger if possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29811/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8097260396,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5Z3pqazwAAAAHiomNs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8097260396","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a3efd1a9a84b530e655f2948cc6716d948afe2ec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/a3efd1a9a84b530e655f2948cc6716d948afe2ec","created_at":"2022-12-22T16:24:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-22T16:24:34Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T16:24:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29917","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29917/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29917/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29917/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/29917","id":1508166534,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAPaMMs5GDpZb","number":29917,"title":"Allow
