a parameter is used as the pattern for StartsWith/EndsWith/Contains, in 8.0.0 we rewrite that parameter to escape any wildchars. However, when the same parameter is reused in two different such methods (e.g. StartsWith and Contains), the same parameter name is used, with the second overwriting the first.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nawait using var ctx = new BlogContext();\r\nawait ctx.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();\r\nawait ctx.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();\r\n\r\nvar s = \"foo\";\r\n_ = await ctx.Blogs.Where(b => b.Name.StartsWith(s) || b.Body.Contains(s)).ToListAsync();\r\n\r\npublic class BlogContext : DbContext\r\n{\r\n    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n        => optionsBuilder\r\n            .UseSqlServer(\"Server=localhost;Database=test;User=SA;Password=Abcd5678;Connect Timeout=60;ConnectRetryCount=0;Encrypt=false\")\r\n            .LogTo(Console.WriteLine, LogLevel.Information)\r\n            .EnableSensitiveDataLogging();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Blog\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string Name { get; set; }\r\n    public string Body { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces the following query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nExecuted DbCommand (48ms) [Parameters=[@__s_0_rewritten='%foo%' (Size = 4000)], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='30']\r\nSELECT [b].[Id], [b].[Body], [b].[Name]\r\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\r\nWHERE [b].[Name] LIKE @__s_0_rewritten ESCAPE N'\\' OR [b].[Body] LIKE @__s_0_rewritten ESCAPE N'\\'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe StartsWith here is translated to the first LIKE, which incorrectly uses the same parameter as the Contains, with `%foo%` instead of `foo%`.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to use two separate variables.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in #31482.
