upgrading to EF Core 9, a unit test using the InMemory database throws this exception: \n```txt\nSystem.ArgumentException\n  HResult=0x80070057\n  Message=Method 'System.String ToString(System.String)' declared on type 'System.DateOnly' cannot be called with instance of type 'System.Nullable`1[System.DateOnly]'\n  Source=System.Linq.Expressions\n  StackTrace:\n   at System.Linq.Expressions.Expression.ValidateCallInstanceType(Type instanceType, MethodInfo method) in /_/src/libraries/System.Linq.Expressions/src/System/Linq/Expressions/MethodCallExpression.cs:line 1265\n```\nThis is from the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory package.\n\nWhen I look into this package code where the exception originates, I see the following change between version 8 and version 9:\n\nEF Core 8:\nNamespace Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory.Query.Internal\nInMemoryExpressionTranslatingExpressionVisitor.cs line 888:\n```csharp\n        // if object is nullable, add null safeguard before calling the function\n        // we special-case Nullable<>.GetValueOrDefault, which doesn't need the safeguard\n        if (methodCallExpression.Object != null\n            && @object!.Type.IsNullableType()\n            && methodCallExpression.Method.Name != nameof(Nullable<int>.GetValueOrDefault))\n        {\n```\n\nEF Core 9:\nInMemoryExpressionTranslatingExpressionVisitor.cs line 887:\n```csharp\n        // if object is nullable, add null safeguard before calling the function\n        // we special-case Nullable<>.GetValueOrDefault, which doesn't need the safeguard,\n        // and Nullable<>.ToString when the object is a nullable value type.\n        if (methodCallExpression.Object != null\n            && @object!.Type.IsNullableType()\n            && methodCallExpression.Method.Name != nameof(Nullable<int>.GetValueOrDefault)\n            && (!@object!.Type.IsNullableValueType()\n                || methodCallExpression.Method.Name != nameof(Nullable<int>.ToString)))\n\n```\n\nSo the new code adds explicitly a `Nullable<>.ToString` according to the comment, but this new code throws an exception at runtime because it cannot be called!\n\n(For using an EF Core InMemory database in a unit test, yes I know that's not a good practice, but we inherited this Solution)\n\nThe Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer package does not have this bug, it exhibits the expected behavior.\n\nThis seems a regression to me.. It is also interesting to see that the code makes an exception for the `int` value type, but not for any other value type.\n\nEF Core version: 9.0\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemor\nTarget framework: .NET 0.0)\nOperating system: Windows 11 21H2\nIDE: Visual Studio 2022 17.12.3\n","closed_by":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35299/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
