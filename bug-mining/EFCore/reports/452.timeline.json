If the base type is ignored later and a migration is generated EF preserves the discriminator value even though the is no corresponding discriminator property.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nWhen adding another migration in the above scenario EF will generate an operation to drop the non-existing discriminator column, resulting in an error. A workaround is to manually edit the snapshot or the migration, but this would need to be done after every new migration.\r\nWhile there has only been one report this affects models with an abstract unmapped base type, which is not that uncommon.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer reported on 8.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nYes, from 7\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nTest added.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. The fix is in code that only runs as part of a design-time

I also have a derived class that is part of an unowned relationship. I can generate a migration for this but when I immediately generate a second migration, EF generates one where it wants to delete a column \"Discriminator\" on the unowned relationship and this column doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nThis worked in EF Core 6. I ran into this after migrating to EF Core 8. I'm hoping it's an issue with my configuration. I also tested on SQLite and while it still generates similar migrations, `dotnet ef database update` does work on it.\r\n\r\n### Include your code\r\n\r\nHere's the full reproduction with details in the readme: https://github.com/kbaley/efcore-8-owned-relationship\r\n\r\nThis is the main part of the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\n\r\npublic class BloggingContext : DbContext\r\n{\r\n    public DbSet<Post> Posts { get; set; }\r\n    public DbSet<Person> People { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public string DbPath { get; }\r\n\r\n    public BloggingContext()\r\n    {\r\n        var folder = Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData;\r\n        var path = Environment.GetFolderPath(folder);\r\n        DbPath = Path.Join(path, \"blogging.db\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder options) {\r\n        var conn = \"CONNSTRING\";\r\n        options.UseSqlServer(conn);\r\n        // options.UseSqlite();\r\n    }\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Post>()\r\n            .OwnsOne(p => p.Address);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Post\r\n{\r\n    public int PostId { get; set; }\r\n    public string Title { get; set; }\r\n    public string Content { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public Address Address { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Person\r\n{\r\n    public int PersonId { get; set; }\r\n    public IEnumerable<PersonAddress> Addresses { get; set; } = new List<PersonAddress>();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Address\r\n{\r\n    [Key]\r\n    public int AddressId { get; set; }\r\n    \r\n    public string City { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class PersonAddress : Address\r\n{\r\n    public string Street { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Include stack traces\r\n\r\nNo stack trace. The error occurs when you try to run `dotnet ef database update` after generating the second migration.\r\n\r\n### Include verbose output\r\n\r\nOutput when running `dotnet ef database update --verbose` after generating two migrations:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet exec --depsfile /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/bin/Debug/net8.0/EFGetStarted.deps.json --additionalprobingpath /Users/kylebaley/.nuget/packages --runtimeconfig /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/bin/Debug/net8.0/EFGetStarted.runtimeconfig.json /Users/kylebaley/.dotnet/tools/.store/dotnet-ef/8.0.6/dotnet-ef/8.0.6/tools/net8.0/any/tools/netcoreapp2.0/any/ef.dll database update --assembly /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/bin/Debug/net8.0/EFGetStarted.dll --project /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/EFGetStarted.csproj --startup-assembly /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/bin/Debug/net8.0/EFGetStarted.dll --startup-project /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/EFGetStarted.csproj --project-dir /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/ --root-namespace EFGetStarted --language C# --framework net8.0 --nullable --working-dir /Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship --verbose\r\nUsing assembly 'EFGetStarted'.\r\nUsing startup assembly 'EFGetStarted'.\r\nUsing application base '/Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/bin/Debug/net8.0'.\r\nUsing working directory '/Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship'.\r\nUsing root namespace 'EFGetStarted'.\r\nUsing project directory '/Users/kylebaley/Documents/workspace/efcore-8-owned-relationship/'.\r\nRemaining arguments: .\r\nFinding DbContext classes...\r\nFinding IDesignTimeDbContextFactory implementations...\r\nFinding application service provider in assembly 'EFGetStarted'...\r\nFinding Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting service provider...\r\nNo static method 'CreateHostBuilder(string[])' was found on class 'Program'.\r\nNo application service provider was found.\r\nFinding DbContext classes in the project...\r\nFound DbContext 'BloggingContext'.\r\nUsing context 'BloggingContext'.\r\nFinding design-time services referenced by assembly 'EFGetStarted'...\r\nFinding design-time services referenced by assembly 'EFGetStarted'...\r\nNo referenced design-time services were found.\r\nFinding design-time services for provider 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer'...\r\nUsing design-time services from provider 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer'.\r\nFinding IDesignTimeServices implementations in assembly 'EFGetStarted'...\r\nNo design-time services were found.\r\nCreating DbConnection.\r\nCreated DbConnection.

Running multiple empty migrations will generate the same changes where it tries to delete the discriminator.\r\n\r\nThis was not the behavior i had in EF7.\r\n\r\nLet me know if i'm either doing something unsupported or if this could indeed be a bug.\r\n\r\n <details>\r\n  <summary>Why i'm doing things this way</summary>\r\n  \r\n  Temporal tables track changes, but in my case i'm using a [bulk update library ](https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions) which generates a lot of `UPDATE` statements. This would cause a lot of rows in the history table when the data did not really change.\r\n  \r\nSo i have a main table and sync this with the 'SnapShots' table via a query and that way my temporal data only contains actual changes. \r\n</details> \r\n\r\n### Include provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 8.0.2\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework: .NET 8.0.2\r\nOperating system: Win11\r\nIDE: Latest vs\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33188/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18159107249,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAPaMMs6GxnICzwAAAAQ6Xfyx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18159107249","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T20:02:16Z","label":{"name":"type-bug","color":"f7c6c7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18159107260,"node_id":"ITAE_lADOAPaMMs6GxnICzwAAAAQ6Xfy8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18159107260","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"issue_type_added","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T20:02:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18165317819,"node_id":"MADE_lADOAPaMMs6GxnICzwAAAAQ6vMC7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18165317819","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"marked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-16T08:47:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
