Bug description\n\nIn EF Core 8, queries using `DefaultIfEmpty()` on value types were automatically translated to include a `COALESCE` function in the generated SQL:\n\n```sql\n// LINQ query\nfrom account in dbContext.Accounts\nfrom balance in account.Transactions\n    .Where(x => x.AccountId > 500)\n    .Take(1)\n    .OrderBy(x => true)\n    .Select(x => x.Balance)\n    .DefaultIfEmpty()\nselect balance;\n\n-- EF Core 8 SQL translation\nSELECT COALESCE([t0].[Balance], 0.0)\nFROM [Accounts] AS [a]\nOUTER APPLY (\n    SELECT TOP(1) [t].[Balance]\n    FROM [Transactions] AS [t]\n    WHERE [a].[AccountId] = [t].[AccountId] AND [t].[AccountId] > 500\n) AS [t0]\n\n```\nIn EF Core 9, this translation behavior has changed. The COALESCE is no longer applied:\n\n```sql\n-- EF Core 9 SQL translation\nSELECT [t0].[Balance]\nFROM [Accounts] AS [a]\nOUTER APPLY (\n    SELECT TOP(1) [t].[Balance]\n    FROM [Transactions] AS [t]\n    WHERE [a].[AccountId] = [t].[AccountId] AND [t].[AccountId] > 500\n) AS [t0]\n\n```\nWithout the COALESCE, NULL values can be returned, causing InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value when materializing to non-nullable types.\n\nThe workaround is to explicitly handle nullability in the LINQ query by casting to a nullable type and using the null-coalescing operator:\n\n```csharp\nfrom account in dbContext.Accounts\nfrom balance in account.Transactions\n    .Where(x => x.AccountId > 500)\n    .Take(1)\n    .OrderBy(x => true)\n    .Select(x => (decimal?)x.Balance) // Cast to nullable\n    .DefaultIfEmpty()\nselect balance ?? 0m; // Handle null\n```\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;\nusing System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\n\nusing var dbContext = new PlayGroundEfCoreContext();\n\ndbContext.Database.EnsureCreated();\n\n/*\ndbContext.Add(new Account()\n{\n    Transactions = new List<Transaction>()\n    {\n        new Transaction()\n        {\n            Balance = 100\n        }\n    }\n});\n\ndbContext.SaveChanges();\n*/\n\nvar balances = (\n    from account in dbContext.Accounts\n\n    from balance in account.Transactions\n        .Where(x => x.AccountId > 500)\n        .Take(1)\n        .OrderBy(x => true)\n        .Select(x => x.Balance)\n        .DefaultIfEmpty()\n\n    select balance).ToList();\n\n\nConsole.WriteLine(JsonSerializer.Serialize(balances));\n\n\npublic class PlayGroundEfCoreContext : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet<Account> Accounts { get; set; }\n    public DbSet<Transaction> Transactions { get; set; }\n\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\n    {\n        optionsBuilder\n            .UseSqlite(\"Data Source=test.db\")\n            .LogTo(Console.WriteLine, LogLevel.Information)\n            .EnableSensitiveDataLogging();\n    }\n\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n    {\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Account>()\n            .HasMany(a => a.Transactions)\n            .WithOne(t => t.Account)\n            .HasForeignKey(t => t.AccountId);\n    }\n}\n\n[Table(\"Accounts\")]\npublic class Account\n{\n    public int AccountId { get; set; }\n    public ICollection<Transaction> Transactions { get; set; }\n}\n\n[Table(\"Transactions\")]\npublic class Transaction\n{\n    public int TransactionId { get; set; }\n    public int AccountId { get; set; }\n    public decimal Balance { get; set; }\n    public Account Account { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\nSystem.InvalidOperationException\n  HResult=0x80131509\n  Message=Nullable object must have a value.\n  Source=System.Private.CoreLib\n  StackTrace:\n   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowInvalidOperationException_InvalidOperation_NoValue()\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.SingleQueryingEnumerable`1.Enumerator.MoveNext()\n   at System.Collections.Generic.List`1..ctor(IEnumerable`1 collection)\n   at System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source)\n   at Program.<<Main>$>d__0.MoveNext() in\n```\n\n### Verbose output\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### EF Core version\n\n9.0.4\n\n### Database provider\n\nSqlServer & Sqlite\n\n### Target framework\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### IDE\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
