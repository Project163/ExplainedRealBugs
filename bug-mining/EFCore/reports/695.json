reading the codebase of Efcore I noticed a small inefficiency in a function used extensively throughout Efcore and I thought it was probably worth addressing.\r\n\r\nEfcore/Metadata/RuntimeModel.cs ->

FindIndexerPropertyInfo([DynamicallyAccessedMembers(IEntityType.DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes)] Type type)\r\n        => _indexerPropertyInfoMap.GetOrAdd(type, type.FindIndexerProperty());\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above code, though the `_indexerPropertyMap` is used to ensure we get the same indexer for the same type, because we're calling `type.FindIndexerProperty()` we're not getting much benefit from it because the `FindIndexerProperty` function is run no matter if there is a key found or not.\r\n\r\nThe `GetOrAdd` function of the ConcurrentDictionary has an overload that accepts a `Func<TKey, TValue>` factory method specifically for this purpose.  \r\n\r\nIf we instead change the function to the following:\r\n```csharp\r\n    private PropertyInfo? FindIndexerPropertyInfo([DynamicallyAccessedMembers(IEntityType.DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes)] Type type)\r\n        => _indexerPropertyInfoMap.GetOrAdd(type, EntityFrameworkCore.Internal.TypeExtensions.FindIndexerProperty);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use the overload that accepts the `Func<TKey, TValue>` and only call the function if the key was not found in the map.","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34823/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34823/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
