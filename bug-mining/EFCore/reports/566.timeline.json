are consistently translated using the default type mapping (unless the user asks for a different mapping), the test should still pass as intended, as args[0] will have a matching type mapping.\n\nIf that is not the case, what would be the appropriate way to construct the translation for `BoolSwitch` (in a cross-provider compatible way)?\n@roji Can we omit the type mapping while constructing the

the way I see this is its mostly a very minor issue.\n\nIt's basically the difference of in this case outputting a `0` or `1` based on the `BoolTypeMapping` (as specified in the test base) versus using a provider specific (e.g. `SqlServerBoolTypeMapping` or any other) where it will use `TRUE` or `FALSE` as default. \n\nIn terms of query results it shouldn't make a difference. Off the top of my head most databases can understand 0 and 1 for boolean as well as any named constants\n\nI had to fix mine but that's just MS Access being different\n\nThe only reason you see this slight difference in what string literal is produced is that the base `BoolTypeMapping` is specifically hard-coded for that in the
