`SqlExpressionSimplifyingExpressionVisitor` performs an [invalid optimization](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/v8.0.5/src/EFCore.Relational/Query/Internal/SqlExpressionSimplifyingExpressionVisitor.cs#L203-L218) of `CASE-WHEN` expressions:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n        // generic CASE statement comparison optimization:\r\n        // (CASE\r\n        //  WHEN condition1 THEN result1\r\n        //  WHEN condition2 THEN result2\r\n        //  WHEN ...\r\n        //  WHEN conditionN THEN resultN) == result1 -> condition1\r\n        if (sqlBinaryExpression.OperatorType == ExpressionType.Equal\r\n            && sqlConstantComponent?.Value is not null\r\n            && caseComponent is { Operand: null, ElseResult: null })\r\n        {\r\n            var matchingCaseBlock = caseComponent.WhenClauses.FirstOrDefault(wc =>

}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe simplification has these additional requirements that are currently not being checked:\r\n1. the `sqlConstantComponent?.Value` only appears once in the list of case results\r\n2. the `matchingCaseBlock` is disjoint from all of the previous cases\r\n3. the (omitted) `ELSE` is never reached, aka at least one of the conditions holds\r\n\r\nAn example program that showcases the bug (and can be conveniently run on https://dotnetfiddle.net/ ;) ) is:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Data;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.SqlExpressions;\r\n\r\nusing var db = new BloggingContext();\r\n\r\ndb.Database.EnsureDeleted();\r\ndb.Database.EnsureCreated();\r\n\r\ndb.Blogs\r\n    .Where(x => db.Cases(\r\n        x.Url == \"http://efcore/\", 3,\r\n        x.Url.StartsWith(\"http://\"), 2,\r\n        x.Url.EndsWith(\"/\"), 3\r\n    ) >= 3)\r\n    .ToList();\r\n\r\ndb.Blogs\r\n    .Where(x => db.Cases(\r\n        x.Url == \"http://efcore/\", 3,\r\n        x.Url.StartsWith(\"http://\"), 2,\r\n        x.Url.EndsWith(\"/\"), 3\r\n    ) == 3)\r\n    .ToList();\r\n\r\ndb.Blogs\r\n

.LogTo(Console.WriteLine, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.Information)\r\n            .UseSqlite($\"Data Source=test.db\");\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        modelBuilder\r\n            .HasDbFunction(typeof(BloggingContext).GetMethod(nameof(Cases))!)\r\n            .HasTranslation(args =>\r\n                new CaseExpression([\r\n                    new CaseWhenClause(args[0], args[1]),\r\n                    new CaseWhenClause(args[2], args[3]),\r\n                    new CaseWhenClause(args[4], args[5]),\r\n                ])\r\n            );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int Cases(bool c1, int v1, bool c2, int v2, bool c3, int v3)\r\n        => throw new NotSupportedException();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Blog\r\n{\r\n    public int BlogId { get; set; }\r\n    public required string Url { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first query is correctly translated as:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \"b\".\"BlogId\", \"b\".\"Url\"\r\nFROM \"Blogs\" AS \"b\"\r\nWHERE CASE\r\n      WHEN \"b\".\"Url\" = 'http://efcore/' THEN 3\r\n      WHEN \"b\".\"Url\" LIKE 'http://%' THEN 2\r\n      WHEN \"b\".\"Url\" LIKE '%/' THEN 3\r\nEND >= 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second query is simplified to\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \"b\".\"BlogId\", \"b\".\"Url\"\r\nFROM \"Blogs\" AS \"b\"\r\nWHERE \"b\".\"Url\" = 'http://efcore/'\r\n```\r\nwhich misses all of the `Url`s that would match the 3rd-case (example: `https://efcore/`).\r\n\r\nThe third query is simplified to\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \"b\".\"BlogId\", \"b\".\"Url\"\r\nFROM \"Blogs\" AS \"b\"\r\nWHERE \"b\".\"Url\" LIKE 'http://%'\r\n```\r\nwhich incorrectly also matches `http://efcore/`.\r\n\r\n### Include

\r\n\r\nI just happen to be in this section of the codebase today as I am working through a similar issue I am having in the Windowing functions support.  I decided to take a quick peek.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the exception is that the generated sql allows a null to bleed out which then causes a type mismatch.  The shaper lambda then throws an exception due to a bad cast of null => boolean \r\n\r\nSqlite is generating the following which allows a null return value.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT CASE\r\n    WHEN \"e\".\"Name\" = 'paul' THEN 3\r\n    ELSE NULL\r\nEND >= 3 AS \"Id\"\r\nFROM \"Employees\" AS \"e\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Sql Server this is not valid syntax due to the >= 3.  The Sql Server code path wraps everything in another case to get this valid syntax.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT CASE\r\n    WHEN CASE\r\n        WHEN [e].[Name] = N'foo' THEN 3\r\n        ELSE NULL\r\n    END >= 3 THEN CAST(1 AS bit)\r\n    ELSE CAST(0 AS bit)\r\nEND AS [Id]\r\nFROM [Employees] AS [e]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is also valid on Sqlite and stops the null from escaping.  Applying this same manipulation is probably the correct fix - that exercise is left to the reader :)\r\n\r\nSql Server handels this case by overriding the Optimize function in SqlServerParameterBasedSqlProcessor.  SqlServerParameterBasedSqlProcessor is then using the SearchConditionConvertingExpressionVisitor which applies the extra case statement via the VisitSqlBinary -> ApplyConversion -> ConvertToValue call chain.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2118979992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmiddleton","id":11600726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjAwNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11600726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton","html_url":"https://github.com/pmiddleton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmiddleton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12856767584,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs6JVNf3zwAAAAL-UrRg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/12856767584","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-18T19:10:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12856767589,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs6JVNf3zwAAAAL-UrRl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/12856767589","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-18T19:10:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2119160180","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33752#issuecomment-2119160180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33752","id":2119160180,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5-T9F0","user":{"login":"ranma42","id":1506030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDYwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1506030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42","html_url":"https://github.com/ranma42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-19T09:01:39Z","updated_at":"2024-05-19T09:01:39Z","body":"@pmiddleton

In a way, since the exception thrown by EFCore matches the one from the `.Max()` definition, this is a happy result. Unfortunately this is inconsistent with the query which also projects the results through `.Select(z => z > 123 ? \"T\" : \"F\")`, which is compiled to\r\n```sql\r\n      SELECT CASE\r\n          WHEN (\r\n              SELECT MAX(\"p\".\"Id\")\r\n              FROM \"Post\" AS \"p\"\r\n              WHERE \"b\".\"Id\" = \"p\".\"BlogId\") > 123 THEN 'T'\r\n          ELSE 'F'\r\n      END\r\n      FROM \"Blogs\" AS \"b\"\r\n```\r\nin which no exception is thrown and `.Max()` is treated as if it returned `int?`.\r\n\r\nI think the mismatch between C# and SQL behavior is known and possibly intended/expected, but the weirdness around further computations on the result of the aggregation is unfortunate.\r\n\r\n### Include provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 8.0.5\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite\r\nTarget framework: .NET 8.0\r\nOperating system: Linux (/WSL)\r\nIDE: Visual Studio Code 1.89.1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
