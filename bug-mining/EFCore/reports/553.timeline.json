set; } = new EndpointTelemetryConfig();\n....  \n\n\n`EndpointTelemetryConfig` class has this property:\n`public List<FieldConfig> FieldConfigs { get; set; } = [];`\nThis property is mapped as json in my ApplicationDbContext.\nThis structure has not been changed (checked git history) and it was previously working, but it's the only one that could provoke \"handleJson\" in the exception stack\n\n#\n protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n {\n     modelBuilder.Entity<EndpointConfig>(epc =>\n     {\n         epc.HasKey(e => e.EndpointId);\n         epc.Property(e => e.SerializedProviderConfig).IsRequired();\n\n         epc.OwnsOne(e => e.TelemetryConfig, tc =>\n         {\n             tc.ToJson();\n             tc.OwnsMany(t => t.FieldConfigs, fc =>\n             {\n                 fc.ToJson();\n             });\n         });
