is a regular interceptor, meaning that different contexts with different interceptor configurations share the same service provider. However, queries also get cached within the service provider, and since IQueryExpressionInterceptor can affect queries, a context with one interceptor configuration can get a query cache hit for a query generated by another context with a different interceptor configuration.\n\nThanks to @GLuca74 for finding this out in #36004.\n\nIQueryExpressionInterceptor probably needs to be made an ISingletonInterceptor, so that different interceptor configurations would trigger different service providers, and the caches wouldn't be shared.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Repro</summary>\n\n```c#\nawait using var context1 = new BlogContext(withInterceptor: true);\nawait using var context2 = new BlogContext(withInterceptor: false);\n\nawait context1.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();\nawait context1.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();\n\n_ = await context1.Blogs.Where(b => b.Name == \"foo\").ToListAsync(); // generates 'bar', expected\n_ = await context2.Blogs.Where(b => b.Name == \"foo\").ToListAsync(); // also generates 'bar', not expected\n\npublic class BlogContext(bool withInterceptor) : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }\n\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\n    {\n        optionsBuilder\n            .UseSqlServer(\"Server=localhost;Database=test;User=SA;Password=Abcd5678;Connect Timeout=60;ConnectRetryCount=0;Encrypt=false\")\n            .LogTo(Console.WriteLine, LogLevel.Information)\n            .EnableSensitiveDataLogging();\n\n        if (withInterceptor)\n        {\n            optionsBuilder.AddInterceptors(new MyQueryInterceptor());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Blog\n{\n    public int Id { get; set; }\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n\nclass MyQueryInterceptor : IQueryExpressionInterceptor\n{\n    public Expression QueryCompilationStarting(Expression queryExpression, QueryExpressionEventData eventData)\n        => new MyVisitor().Visit(queryExpression);\n\n    class MyVisitor : ExpressionVisitor\n    {\n        protected override Expression VisitConstant(ConstantExpression node)\n            => node.Value is \"foo\"\n                ?
