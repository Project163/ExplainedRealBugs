The Azure Cosmos DB provider for EF Core currently does not support index definitions.'\n\nThis error message I believe is coming [from this line in the designer](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/aed754c34a426afdc633c32f3d9f88a681e90c41/src/EFCore.Cosmos/Properties/CosmosStrings.Designer.cs#L167).\n\nIt looks like this is related to #34023.  The assumption with this is that since Cosmos ignores the model builder function that creates an index, that the Cosmos designer should throw and error.  In this case of my project, ignoring the index is just fine, and should not throw an error.  Perhaps this can have an option to convert this from an error to a warning?\n\nThe entity \"IndentiyRole\" is inherited from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityRole, and it is there that the index is defined for the property NormalizedName. So this is something that is out of my control.\n\nMy question is this: Is there a way I can have the Cosmos DB provider \"ignore\" indexes so the error does not get thrown?  Or perhaps there is something in the EntityTypeBuilder that I can do to remove the offending index, or ignore it?\n\nThanks!\n\n-Eric\n\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2515197984","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/34023#issuecomment-2515197984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34023","id":2515197984,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs6V6uAg","user":{"login":"toiyabe","id":52581997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTgxOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52581997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe","html_url":"https://github.com/toiyabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toiyabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-03T17:39:31Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T17:39:31Z","body":"This has caused an unforeseen problem with by project.
