Question\n\nHello, \n\nI am currently writing an EntityFramework Provider. While translating the expression produced by NorthwindSelectQueryTestBase.SelectMany_correlated_with_outer_3, I noticed that the NavigationExpandingExpressionVisitor moves the .Select(o => c.City) behind the .DefaultIfEmpty().\n\nI'm probably missing something, but this seems wrong, as \nEnumerable.Empty<object>().DefaultIfEmpty().Select(x => \"foo\")\nis not the same as\nEnumerable.Empty<object>().Select(x => \"foo\").DefaultIfEmpty()\n\nSo now I'm left wondering how to handle this, because there are valid uses for both cases. Once the NavigationExpandingExpressionVisitor transforms the expression however I can no longer distinguish between these cases.\n\nI would be very thankful if you could give me some pointers on what the actual behaviour should be.\n\nBest Regards\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\nNorthwindSelectQueryTestBase.SelectMany_correlated_with_outer_3:\n\nfrom c in ss.Set<Customer>()\nfrom o in ss.Set<Order>().Where(o => c.CustomerID == o.CustomerID).Select(o => c.City).DefaultIfEmpty()\nselect new { c, o }\n\nHere's what the query looks like just before and after the call to the NavigationExpandingExpressionVisitor in QueryTranslationPreprocessor.cs Process(Expression query)\n\nBefore NavigationExpandingExpressionVisitor:\n\n[Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.EntityQueryRootExpression]\n  .SelectMany(c => \n    [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.EntityQueryRootExpression]\n      .Where(o => (c.CustomerID == o.CustomerID))\n      .Select(o => c.City)\n      .DefaultIfEmpty(), \n    (c, o) => new <>f__AnonymousType0`2(c = c, o = o)\n  )\n\nAfter NavigationExpandingExpressionVisitor:\n\n[Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.EntityQueryRootExpression]\n  .SelectMany(c => \n    [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.EntityQueryRootExpression]\n      .Where(o => (c.CustomerID == o.CustomerID))\n      .DefaultIfEmpty()\n      .Select(o => c.City),\n    (c, c) => new TransparentIdentifier`2(Outer = c, Inner = c))\n  .Select(ti => new <>f__AnonymousType0`2(c = ti.Outer, o = ti.Inner))\n```\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Verbose output\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### EF Core version\n\n9.0.0\n\n### Database provider\n\n_No response_\n\n### Target framework\n\n.NET 9.0\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### IDE\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
