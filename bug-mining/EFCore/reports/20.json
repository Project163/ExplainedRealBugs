currently always wrap changes in a transaction - but that isn't necessary when only a single change is involved. Here's a comparison of a single change with and without a transaction:\r\n\r\n|                                          Method | DatabaseType |       Mean |    Error |   StdDev |     Median | Ratio | RatioSD |\r\n|------------------------------------------------ |------------- |-----------:|---------:|---------:|-----------:|------:|--------:|\r\n|                           UpdateWithTransaction |     Postgres | 1,171.1 us | 20.53 us | 19.20 us | 1,172.1 us |  1.00 |    0.00 |\r\n|                        UpdateWithoutTransaction |     Postgres |   998.9 us | 19.17 us | 16.99 us |   999.4 us |  0.85 |    0.02 |\r\n| UpdateWithoutTransaction_SetImplicitTransaction |     Postgres |         NA |       NA |       NA |         NA |     ? |       ? |\r\n|                                           Query |     Postgres |   202.0 us |  5.40 us | 15.93 us |   206.9 us |  0.18 |    0.01 |\r\n\r\nSo the difference on PostgreSQL is 14.6%. Note that since unneeded roundtrips are eliminated (2 on Npgsql, 3 on SQL Server and most other providers), the perf gain increases as server latency increases (the above 14.6% are against localhost, so it's a minimum figure).\r\n\r\nOn SQL Server (localhost) the gain is higher, 27.8%.\r\n\r\nNote that when an external transaction already exists, we still need to create a savepoint, even if there's only one change, since databases behave quite differently when a failure occurs during transaction, and a rollback to a savepoint is necessary in at least some cases (e.g. PostgreSQL).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Benchmark code</summary>\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nBenchmarkRunner.Run<Benchmark>();\r\n\r\npublic class Benchmark\r\n{\r\n    private DbConnection _connection;\r\n    private DbCommand _command;\r\n\r\n    [Params(DatabaseType.Postgres, DatabaseType.SqlServer)]\r\n    public DatabaseType DatabaseType { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    private async Task Setup()\r\n    {\r\n        _connection = DatabaseType == DatabaseType.Postgres\r\n            ? new NpgsqlConnection(\"Host=localhost;Username=test;Password=test;Max Auto Prepare=10\")\r\n            : new SqlConnection(\"Server=localhost;Database=test;User=SA;Password=Abcd5678;Connect Timeout=60;ConnectRetryCount=0;Trust Server Certificate=true\");\r\n        await _connection.OpenAsync();\r\n\r\n        using var cmd = _connection.CreateCommand();\r\n        cmd.CommandText = @\"\r\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS data;\r\nCREATE TABLE data (id int PRIMARY KEY, num INT);\r\nINSERT INTO data (id, num) VALUES (1, 1)\";\r\n        await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [GlobalSetup(Targets = new[] { nameof(UpdateWithTransaction), nameof(UpdateWithoutTransaction)})]\r\n    public async Task Setup_Update()\r\n    {\r\n        await Setup();\r\n\r\n        _command = _connection.CreateCommand();\r\n        _command.CommandText = \"UPDATE data SET num = num + 1\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [GlobalSetup(Target = nameof(UpdateWithoutTransaction_SetImplicitTransaction))]\r\n    public async Task Setup_UpdateWithoutTransaction_SetImplicitTransaction()\r\n    {\r\n        if (DatabaseType != DatabaseType.SqlServer)\r\n            throw new NotSupportedException(\"Benchmark relevant only for SQL Server\");\r\n        await Setup();\r\n\r\n        _command = _connection.CreateCommand();\r\n        _command.CommandText = \"SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF; UPDATE data SET num = num + 1\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    [GlobalSetup(Target = nameof(Query))]\r\n    public async Task Setup_Query()\r\n    {\r\n        await Setup();\r\n\r\n        _command = _connection.CreateCommand();\r\n        _command.CommandText = \"SELECT num FROM data WHERE id = 1\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]\r\n    public async Task UpdateWithTransaction()\r\n    {\r\n        var tx = _connection.BeginTransaction();\r\n        _command.Transaction = tx;\r\n        await _command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();\r\n        tx.Commit();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Benchmark]\r\n    public async Task UpdateWithoutTransaction()\r\n    {\r\n        await _command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Benchmark]\r\n    public async Task UpdateWithoutTransaction_SetImplicitTransaction()\r\n    {\r\n        await _command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Benchmark]\r\n    public async Task Query()\r\n    {\r\n        await _command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic enum DatabaseType\r\n{\r\n    Postgres,\r\n    SqlServer\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27439/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
