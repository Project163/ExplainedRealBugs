Description\r\nWhen I try to get distinct records by property with complex property I get an \"The multi-part identifier \"xxx\" could not be bound\" error.\r\n\r\n### Minimal example:\r\n#### Models\r\n```c#\r\ninternal class Supplier\r\n{\r\n    public Guid Id { get; set; }\r\n    public Size Size { get; set; }\r\n}\r\ninternal class Size\r\n{\r\n    public int Height { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n#### Configuration\r\n```cs\r\nprotected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n{\r\n    modelBuilder.Entity<Supplier>()\r\n            .ComplexProperty(x => x.Size);\r\n\r\n    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n#### Query\r\n```c#\r\nvar data = dbContext\r\n    .Set<Supplier>()\r\n    .GroupBy(x => x.Id)\r\n    .Select(y => y.First())\r\n    .ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error\r\n`Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: 'The multi-part identifier \"s.Size_Height\" could not be bound.'`\r\n\r\n### Generated SQL\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT [t0].[Id], [t0].[Name], [t0].[Size_Height]\r\n      FROM (\r\n          SELECT [s].[Id]\r\n          FROM [Supplier] AS [s]\r\n          GROUP BY [s].[Id]\r\n      ) AS [t]\r\n      LEFT JOIN (\r\n          SELECT [t1].[Id], [t1].[Name], [t1].[Size_Height]\r\n          FROM (\r\n              SELECT [s0].[Id], [s0].[Name], [s].[Size_Height], ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY [s0].[Id] ORDER BY [s0].[Id]) AS [row]\r\n              FROM [Supplier] AS [s0]\r\n          ) AS [t1]\r\n          WHERE [t1].[row] <= 1\r\n      ) AS [t0] ON [t].[Id] = [t0].[Id]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I understand instead of `[s].[Size_Height]` should be `[s0].[Size_Height]`, but for some reason ef core breaks on the complex property and uses wrong alias.\r\n\r\n\r\n.Net version: 8\r\nEf Core version:
