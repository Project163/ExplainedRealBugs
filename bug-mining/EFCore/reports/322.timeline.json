It was fine if I directly specify the input of  Offset/Fetch. However, I found that when I executed the sql generated by EF which is parameterized, the performance got almost 10 times slower than the former. It could be a disaster if there are extra entities to join.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is an solution for my scenario or maybe is that an opportunity for EF? The Skip()/Take() only accept the int parameter, so I guess it is relatively safe and might be unnecessary to parameterize the input for Offset/Fetch.\r\n\r\n## samples\r\n\r\n**Parameterized  Offset/Fetch with 1 row**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58463695/183619947-40066d8b-39c9-48e7-bff9-1d1e6c0c94aa.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58463695/183620036-85d85e54-0bf9-4006-9086-1d7f1b9a1109.png)\r\n\r\n**Non-parameterized  Offset/Fetch with 1 row**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58463695/183619158-a42ada98-ea38-4561-96a0-c9ea68578bc8.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58463695/183619245-2b2d1c58-2538-43b0-8deb-474117bffed2.png)\r\n\r\n**Non-parameterized  Offset/Fetch with 900 row**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58463695/183619548-edbd20ca-cdf4-48f1-b4d3-fd1b9092269b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58463695/183619649-8f65326c-bf07-4b15-ba77-6962088a96be.png)\r\n\r\n## version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 3.1\r\nDatabase provider: SQL Server in Azure\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1693502563","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31552#issuecomment-1693502563","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31552","id":1693502563,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5k8Mxj","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-25T14:58:36Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T14:58:36Z","body":"```c#\r\nctx.MyView.Take(() => EF.Contant(pageSize)).ToArray();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that if we indeed introduce an overload of Take that accepts a lambda expression, there wouldn't be any need for EF.Constant, since the expression tree itself would contain a constant node vs. a parameter.

This means that by default, all EF queries generate SQL with constants rather than parameters.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to use a F# ref, which gets properly parameterized by EF Core:\r\n\r\n```f#\r\nlet i = ref 8\r\ndb.Events.Where(fun x -> x.Data = i.Value).ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, while this works well with local variables, it's problematic for use with function parameters, since the parameter needs to be typed as `Ref<T>` (it isn't great to require people to change method signatures just so that an EF query inside get properly parameterized). Note that the variable name is also lost, so the SQL contains `@__Value_0`.\r\n\r\nWe could introduced an EF.Param() mechanism, which is identified by EF Core and forces parameterization. The same mechanism could be used in C# to force parameterization for better perf when two queries use different constants, without needing to extract a variable:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar query1 = await ctx.Blogs.Where(b => b.Name == EF.Param(\"foo\")).ToListAsync();\r\n...\r\nvar query2 = await ctx.Blogs.Where(b => b.Name == EF.Param(\"bar\")).ToListAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF.Param could optionally also accept the SQL parameter name, to produce more readable SQL queries.\r\n\r\n/cc @dsyme
