For my tests I use `EnsureCreated` to initialize a new database off of the model. I'm facing an issue with properties configured using `UseIdentityColumn()` where the identity property isn't being set on the column in the new database.\r\n\r\nIf I switch to use the `OnModelCreating` approach to setup the model, the identity property is set as expected.\r\n\r\nThe following code demonstrates the approach that is affected by this issue.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class TestModel\r\n{\r\n    public virtual int Id { get; set; }\r\n    public virtual string Code { get; set; } = string.Empty;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class TestModelConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<TestModel>\r\n{\r\n    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<TestModel> builder)\r\n    {\r\n        builder.ToTable(\"Test\");\r\n        builder.HasKey(x => x.Id);\r\n        builder\r\n            .Property(x => x.Id)\r\n            .UseIdentityColumn();\r\n        builder\r\n            .Property(x => x.Code)\r\n            .IsRequired()\r\n            .HasMaxLength(70);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nModelBuilder modelBuilder = new(SqlServerConventionSetBuilder.Build());\r\nmodelBuilder.ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly(typeof(TestModelConfiguration).Assembly);\r\n\r\nDbContextOptionsBuilder dbContextOptions = new();\r\ndbContextOptions.UseSqlServer(connectionString);\r\ndbContextOptions.UseModel(modelBuilder.FinalizeModel());\r\n\r\nusing TestDbContext dbContext = new(_dbContextOptions.Options);\r\ndbContext.Database.EnsureCreated();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33684/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
