Bug description\n\nI'm overriding CSharpMigrationsGenerator.GenerateMigration() to emit a custom sql migration step (`ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;`) after each migration.\nThis operation is required to be executed out of default transaction.\n\nGenerateMigration() is overriden to append following SqlOperation :\n```cs\nvar clearCacheOperation = new SqlOperation\n{\n    Sql = \"ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;\",\n    SuppressTransaction = true\n};\n\nreturn base.GenerateMigration(migrationNamespace, migrationName, upOperations.Concat(new[] { clearCacheOperation }).ToList(), downOperations);\n```\n\nThe expected result in migration source code would be :\n```cs\nmigrationBuilder.Sql(\"ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;\", suppressTransaction: true);\n```\n\nAs of Entity Frameword v9.0.8, the suppressTransaction parameter is missing in the generated migration.\n\nThe code causing this behavior is in `CSharpMigrationOperationGenerator.Generate(SqlOperation operation, IndentedStringBuilder builder)`, which ignores SuppressTransaction value while appending generated source code.\n\n\n\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations.Design;\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations.Operations;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\npublic sealed class CustomMigrationsGenerator : CSharpMigrationsGenerator\n{\n\n    public CustomMigrationsGenerator(MigrationsCodeGeneratorDependencies deps, CSharpMigrationsGeneratorDependencies csharpDeps) : base(deps, csharpDeps) { }\n\n    public override string GenerateMigration(string migrationNamespace, string migrationName, IReadOnlyList<MigrationOperation> upOperations, IReadOnlyList<MigrationOperation> downOperations)\n    {\n\n        var clearCacheOperation = new SqlOperation\n        {\n            Sql = \"ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION CLEAR PROCEDURE_CACHE;\",\n            SuppressTransaction = true\n        };\n\n        return base.GenerateMigration(migrationNamespace, migrationName, upOperations.Concat(new[] { clearCacheOperation }).ToList(), downOperations);\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Verbose output\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### EF Core version\n\n9.0.8\n\n### Database provider\n\nMicrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\n\n### Target framework\n\n.NET 9.0\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 11\n\n### IDE\n\nVisual Studio 2022
