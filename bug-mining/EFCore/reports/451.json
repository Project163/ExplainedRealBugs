Code snippet:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n    public abstract class Context101 : DbContext\r\n    {\r\n        protected override void ConfigureConventions(ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            base.ConfigureConventions(configurationBuilder);\r\n            configurationBuilder.Conventions.Remove<ForeignKeyIndexConvention>();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n            => optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(\"\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Context0 : Context101\r\n    {\r\n        public class Blog\r\n        {\r\n            public int Id { get; set; }\r\n            public int AlternateId { get; set; }\r\n            public ICollection<Post> Posts { get; } = new List<Post>();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class Post\r\n        {\r\n            public int Id { get; set; }\r\n            public int BlogId { get; set; }\r\n            public Blog Blog { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public DbSet<Blog> Blogs\r\n            => Set<Blog>();\r\n\r\n        public DbSet<Post> Posts\r\n            => Set<Post>();\r\n\r\n        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n            => modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>()\r\n                .HasMany(e => e.Posts)\r\n                .WithOne(e => e.Blog)\r\n                .HasPrincipalKey(e => e.AlternateId);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class ContextAnnotated0 : Context101\r\n    {\r\n        public class Blog\r\n        {\r\n            public int Id { get; set; }\r\n            public int AlternateId { get; set; }\r\n\r\n            [InverseProperty(\"Blog\")]\r\n            public ICollection<Post> Posts { get; } = new List<Post>();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class Post\r\n        {\r\n            public int Id { get; set; }\r\n\r\n            [ForeignKey(\"Blog\")]\r\n            public int BlogId { get; set; }\r\n\r\n            [ForeignKey(\"BlogId\")]\r\n            [Required]\r\n            [InverseProperty(\"Posts\")]\r\n            public Blog Blog { get; set; }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public DbSet<Blog> Blogs\r\n            => Set<Blog>();\r\n\r\n        public DbSet<Post> Posts\r\n            => Set<Post>();\r\n\r\n        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n            => modelBuilder.Entity<Blog>()\r\n                .HasMany(e => e.Posts)\r\n                .WithOne(e => e.Blog)\r\n                .HasPrincipalKey(e => e.AlternateId);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only difference between `Context0` and `ContextAnnotated0` is that `ContextAnnotated0` has additional attributes on properties, which might and should be redundant in this case.\r\n\r\nIf we run following code:\r\n```C#\r\n            await using Context0 context = new();\r\n            await context.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();\r\n            await context.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();\r\n```\r\nthen we will have two tables with two columns each - `Blog(Id, AlternateId)` and `Post(Id, BlogId)`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we run it for annotated context:\r\n```C#\r\n            await using ContextAnnotated0 context = new();\r\n            await context.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();\r\n            await context.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();\r\n```\r\nThen we will have additional column `BlogAlternateId` in `Posts` table.\r\n\r\nThis code is mostly copied from `ModelBuilding101TestBase.OneToManyRequiredWithAlternateKeyTest`. This test passes for SqlServer, because SqlServer by default have `ForeignKeyIndexConvention`. I am developing [EFCore.Snowflake](https://github.com/Sielnix/EFCore.Snowflake), where this convention is removed (Snowflake doesn't have indexes) and constructed model is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Include provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: v8.0.4\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework: .NET 8.0\r\nOperating system: Windows 11 23H2\r\nIDE: Visual Studio 2022 17.9.6\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
