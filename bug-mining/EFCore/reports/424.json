don't work when using EF with VB.NET against PostgreSQL:\r\n\r\n```vb\r\nImports ConsoleApp2.ConsoleApp1\r\n\r\nModule Program\r\n    Sub Main(args As String())\r\n        Dim email = \"test@test.com\"\r\n        Dim db As New MyDbContext\r\n        db.Database.EnsureDeleted()\r\n        db.Database.EnsureCreated()\r\n        db.Add(New Person With {.Id = Guid.NewGuid(), .Email = email})\r\n        db.SaveChanges()\r\n        \r\n        Dim p = db.Person.Single(Function(x) x.Email = email)\r\n        \r\n        Console.WriteLine(p.Email)\r\n    End Sub\r\nEnd Module\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that captured closure variables in VB.NET seem to generated by the VB compiled as a field access with names such as `$VB$Local_email`; this causes the following command to be executed with Npgsql:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT p.\"Id\", p.\"Email\"\r\nFROM \"Person\" AS p\r\nWHERE p.\"Email\" = @__$VB$Local_email_0\r\nLIMIT 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, PostgreSQL has positional parameter placeholders ($1, $2) and not named ones (@p1, @p2), but as a legacy feature, Npgsql rewrites named placeholders to positional ones (e.g. to ease transitioning from SQL Server and other DBs). Unfortunately, the dollar character is special in PostgreSQL, causing `@__$VB$Local_email_0` to not be identified as a parameter placeholder.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution here is to modify EF to use positional placeholders directly when using PG (#27377) - but that's not trivial. The `$VB$` is generally useless in the database parameters even where it's not harmful (e.g. SQL Server). Our funcletizer already performs some parameter name sanitization, trimming out characters after `>`; we should also trim out anything up to the 1st dollar sign.\r\n\r\nOriginally flagged by @sorenjakobsen in https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/3109.\r\n\r\n/cc @vonzshik @NinoFloris","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
