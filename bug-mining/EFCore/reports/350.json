current pruning logic currently only operates on SelectExpressions which are present in the Tables list of other SelectExpressions; it notably doesn't handle subqueries embedded e.g. in the predicate.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following entity type:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic class Blog\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string? Name { get; set; }\r\n    public int Unneeded { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and the following query:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n_ = ctx.Blogs\r\n    .OrderBy(b => b.Id)\r\n    .Take(10)\r\n    .Take(5) // Causes pushdown\r\n    .Select(b => b.Name)\r\n    .ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\n... the Unneeded column gets properly pruned from the projection:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT TOP(@__p_1) [t].[Name]\r\nFROM (\r\n    SELECT TOP(@__p_0) [b].[Id], [b].[Name]\r\n    FROM [Blogs] AS [b]\r\n    ORDER BY [b].[Id]\r\n) AS [t]\r\nORDER BY [t].[Id]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you place the same thing inside a subquery:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n_ = ctx.Blogs\r\n    .Where(b => ctx.Blogs\r\n        .OrderBy(b => b.Id)\r\n        .Take(10)\r\n        .Take(5) // Causes pushdown\r\n        .Select(b => b.Name)\r\n        .First() == \"foo\")\r\n    .ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\n... that yields the following SQL, which does project Unneeded:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT [b].[Id], [b].[Name], [b].[Unneeded]\r\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\r\nWHERE (\r\n    SELECT TOP(1) [t0].[Name]\r\n    FROM (\r\n        SELECT TOP(5) [t].[Name], [t].[Id]\r\n        FROM (\r\n            SELECT TOP(10) [b0].[Id], [b0].[Name], [b0].[Unneeded]\r\n            FROM [Blogs] AS [b0]\r\n            ORDER BY [b0].[Id]\r\n        ) AS [t]\r\n        ORDER BY [t].[Id]\r\n    ) AS [t0]\r\n    ORDER BY [t0].[Id]) = N'foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the pruning logic isn't implemented as a proper visitor which visits the entire tree; instead, SelectExpressionPruningExpressionVisitor (in postprocessing) calls [SelectExpression.Prune](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore.Relational/Query/SqlExpressions/SelectExpression.cs#L3977); this recurses into Tables, but not into the other parts of the query.\r\n\r\nWe should extract the pruning logic out to SelectExpressionPruningExpressionVisitor, taking care with SelectExpression private state etc. Note https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31049#issuecomment-1592948285 which is similar, abuot allowing providers to add other pruning logic.","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31083/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
