Previously, the below query was working though the select portion was running client-side, as the string,Join method was unable to be translated.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to EFCore 7, it seems that it has been implemented using STRING_AGG.  However, we are still using SQL Server 2016 which does not support it (Trying to get us to upgrade but I don't know how soon that may happen).\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there is some way to target EFCore 7 for a specific version of SQL Server (i.e. 2016) and have it fall back to client-side evaluation? I have not seen any method of doing this though so I wanted to see if there are any suggestions or fixes.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to avoid having to modify all of the code where we may be doing this to force client-side evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis also was not part of the breaking changes when upgrading to EFCore7, so it isn't obvious until runtime as well.\r\n\r\nThank you for any

We don't have column/parameter values, so I'm setting the return mapping to be varchar(max) or nvarchar(max) (based on whether we've seen nvarchar or not). See below for \r\n* There's also CONCAT which is similar to CONCAT_WS. We already have a relational translation for string.Concat in [StringMethodTranslator](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/release/7.0/src/EFCore.Relational/Query/Internal/StringMethodTranslator.cs#L19), but that works only for the overloads with 2-4 arguments, and not for 5+ (which has an array parameter). We could translate to CONCAT instead just like for CONCAT_WS, but then we should override the relational and do it regardless of number of args (shouldn't use different translations for different arg numbers).

I think it should be sufficient to simply allow the user to determine the compatibility level ([see this table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level?view=sql-server-ver16#compatibility_level--160--150--140--130--120--110--100--90--80-)). This sidesteps the complexity of SQL Server vs. Azure SQL, and also accounts for the fact that newer SQL Server versions can still be configured for an older compatibility level (with ALTER DATABASE). The downside is that users need to find out which compatibility level they want (i.e. instead just saying \"I'm using SQL Server X, they need to look up the correct compat level value).\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n\r\nAs long as we're discussing this, here are some additional design questions:\r\n\r\n* What should be the default level be? I'm hesitating between 14 (SQL Server 2017) and 15 (SQL Server 2019), though note that I'm note aware of a place where EF would distinguish between the two.\r\n  * Note that we'll presumably bump up the default from time to time in major versions.\r\n* This will first and foremost be a context option (and a singleton option), affecting the SQL Server type mapping source and some method tranlators. However, as I wrote above, SQL Server also allows setting the compat level on the database.\r\n  * Should we also add model metadata to allow configuring the compat level on the database?\r\n  * If so, should it default to the context option?\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1497183381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1497193640","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30163#issuecomment-1497193640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30163","id":1497193640,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5ZPVyo","user":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-05T09:31:52Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T09:31:52Z","body":"> What should be the default level be?

The high-order bit for me is that new users get reasonably new features (and better perf relying on newer database features, e.g. better Contains via OPENJSON) without having to explicitly opt in or even think abuot anything.
