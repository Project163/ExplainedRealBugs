converts an IEnumerable to an IQueryable, allowing an abstraction over queries regardless of whether they're executed locally via LINQ to Objects (IEnumerable) or translated via a LINQ provider.\r\n\r\nWhen the IEnumerable-based IQueryable is executed, we internally compile the expression tree and then invoke it; the delegate is then discarded (single-use). This practice is also being done in EF, and benchmarking it shows that interpretation is very significantly more performant than compilation followed by single use. This PR applies `preferInterpretation: true` for those cases.\r\n\r\nNote that when trimming and using CoreCLR (not NativeAOT), this may cause a size increase since the interpreter is brought in where it could be trimmed (since by default, `Compile()` on CoreCLR doesn't use the interpreter). I have no idea if the linker is that smart though (on NativeAOT this wouldn't change anything since the interpreter must be used anyway).\r\n\r\n/cc @jkotas @vitek-karas

We no longer can embed arbitrary objects into the shaper, instead we need to provide a way to construct that object in code (using LiftableConstant mechanism), or simulate the functionality it used to provide. At the end of our processing, we find all liftable constants and for the non-AOT case we compile their resolver lambdas and invoke the result with liftable context object to produce the resulting constant object we initially wanted. (in AOT case we generate code from the resolver lambda). Problem is that we are compiling the resolver lambda in the interpretation mode - if the final product is itself a delegate, that delegate will itself be in the interpreter mode and therefore less efficient.\r\n\r\nFix is to scan the resolver expression and look for nested lambdas inside - if we find some, compile the resolver in the regular mode instead.\r\n\r\nFixes #35208\r\n\r\nThis is part of a fix for a larger perf issue: #35053","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18158813928,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAPaMMs5YosepzwAAAAQ6WYLo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18158813928","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T18:56:59Z","label":{"name":"type-enhancement","color":"bfe5bf"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18158814012,"node_id":"ITAE_lADOAPaMMs5YosepzwAAAAQ6WYM8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/18158814012","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"issue_type_added","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T18:57:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
