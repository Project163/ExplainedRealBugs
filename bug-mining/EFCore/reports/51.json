fixed the uninitialized DbSet suppressor to suppress warnings when a constructor is present, following a Roslyn fix in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/58073. In order to test this, version 4.2.0 of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp (Roslyn) is required, which contains the fix, but that version hasn't yet RTMed and causes issues with current versions of VS. As a result, we're using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp 4.1.0 and the relevant tests are currently skipped.\r\n\r\nNote: this does not affect the actual suppressor functionality, only the tests. Manually verified with a test program as follows:\r\n\r\nVersion                 | Warning status\r\n----------------------- | --------------\r\n6.0.4                   | Uninitialized DbSet warnings always issued (with or without a constructor)\r\n7.0.0-preview.3         | Warnings issued only when a constructor is present, suppressed without a constructor\r\n7.0.0-preview.5.22226.3 | No warnings are issues (with or without a constructor)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27895/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
