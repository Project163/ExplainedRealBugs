For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 2, many contributed by our community.

One of these might be just the thing you have been waiting for, so read on!\n\n- [Discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues)\n- [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew) documentation.\n- [Documentation & Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs)\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Prune columns passed to OPENJSON's WITH clause\n  - EF9 removes unnecessary columns when calling `OPENJSON WITH`.\n  - See [_Prune columns from JSON_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Translations involving GREATEST/LEAST\n  - Several new translations have been introduced that use the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions.\n  - This includes translations of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` in non-aggregate queries, as well as directly exposing the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions in relational providers.\n  - See [_GREATEST/LEAST translations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Force or prevent query parameterization\n  - Except in some special cases, EF Core parameterizes variables used in a LINQ query, but includes constants in the generated SQL. EF9 allows constants to be translated to parameters and variables to be translated to constants on a case to case basis.\n  - See [_Force or prevent query parameterization_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#force-or-prevent-query-parameterization) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## ExecuteUpdate\n\n- Allow passing complex type instances to ExecuteUpdate\n  - EF9 supports directly passing complex type instances to `ExecuteUpdate` as sugar for updating all member values.\n  - See [_ExecuteUpdate for complex types_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#allow-passing-complex-type-instances-to-executeupdate) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Temporal tables\n\n- Small migrations for temporal tables\n  - The migration created when changing an existing table into a temporal table has been reduced in size for EF9.\n  - See [_Improved temporal table migrations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#improved-temporal-table-migrations) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Model building\n\n- Make existing model building conventions more extensible\n  - In EF9, we have made it easier to extend some of the existing conventions, such as those for property and key discovery.\n  - See [_Extensible model building conventions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#make-existing-model-building-conventions-more-extensible) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors\n  - In EF9, we have both improved the error messages generated when this fails, and also enabled instantiation by non-public constructor.\n  - See [_ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#update-applyconfigurationsfromassembly-to-call-non-public-constructors) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Everything else in Preview 1\n\n Preview 1 contains:\n \n- [30 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [51 bug fixes in EF9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n   - [8 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.1+is%3Aclosed)\n   - [25 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.2](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed+)\n ... (truncated)\n\n## 8.0.17\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\n- **Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade** ([#​36085](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36085))  \n  Updates the project's dependencies using the latest versions from the dotnet/arcade repository. This ensures that the build infrastructure and related tooling are up to date, which can bring in important bug fixes, security patches, and improvements from upstream.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **Update branding to 8.0.17** ([#​36043](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36043))  \n  Updates the internal version branding to 8.0.17. This change ensures that the product and its packages correctly reflect the new release version, helping users and developers identify the build.\n\n- **Merging internal commits for release/8.0** ([#​36080](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36080))  \n  Integrates various internal commits into the release/8.0 branch. This merge brings together important updates and ensures the release branch is synchronized with recent internal development, maintaining consistency and stability for the release.\n\n---\n\nThis summary is generated and may contain inaccuracies.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3.

We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 2, many contributed by our community.

One of these might be just the thing you have been waiting for, so read on!\n\n- [Discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues)\n- [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew) documentation.\n- [Documentation & Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs)\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Prune columns passed to OPENJSON's WITH clause\n  - EF9 removes unnecessary columns when calling `OPENJSON WITH`.\n  - See [_Prune columns from JSON_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Translations involving GREATEST/LEAST\n  - Several new translations have been introduced that use the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions.\n  - This includes translations of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` in non-aggregate queries, as well as directly exposing the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions in relational providers.\n  - See [_GREATEST/LEAST translations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Force or prevent query parameterization\n  - Except in some special cases, EF Core parameterizes variables used in a LINQ query, but includes constants in the generated SQL. EF9 allows constants to be translated to parameters and variables to be translated to constants on a case to case basis.\n  - See [_Force or prevent query parameterization_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#force-or-prevent-query-parameterization) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## ExecuteUpdate\n\n- Allow passing complex type instances to ExecuteUpdate\n  - EF9 supports directly passing complex type instances to `ExecuteUpdate` as sugar for updating all member values.\n  - See [_ExecuteUpdate for complex types_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#allow-passing-complex-type-instances-to-executeupdate) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Temporal tables\n\n- Small migrations for temporal tables\n  - The migration created when changing an existing table into a temporal table has been reduced in size for EF9.\n  - See [_Improved temporal table migrations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#improved-temporal-table-migrations) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Model building\n\n- Make existing model building conventions more extensible\n  - In EF9, we have made it easier to extend some of the existing conventions, such as those for property and key discovery.\n  - See [_Extensible model building conventions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#make-existing-model-building-conventions-more-extensible) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors\n  - In EF9, we have both improved the error messages generated when this fails, and also enabled instantiation by non-public constructor.\n  - See [_ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#update-applyconfigurationsfromassembly-to-call-non-public-constructors) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Everything else in Preview 1\n\n Preview 1 contains:\n \n- [30 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [51 bug fixes in EF9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n   - [8 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.1+is%3Aclosed)\n   - [25 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.2](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed+)\n ... (truncated)\n\n## 8.0.17\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\n- **Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade** ([#​36085](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36085))  \n  Updates the project's dependencies using the latest versions from the dotnet/arcade repository. This ensures that the build infrastructure and related tooling are up to date, which can bring in important bug fixes, security patches, and improvements from upstream.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **Update branding to 8.0.17** ([#​36043](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36043))  \n  Updates the internal version branding to 8.0.17. This change ensures that the product and its packages correctly reflect the new release version, helping users and developers identify the build.\n\n- **Merging internal commits for release/8.0** ([#​36080](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36080))  \n  Integrates various internal commits into the release/8.0 branch. This merge brings together important updates and ensures the release branch is synchronized with recent internal development, maintaining consistency and stability for the release.\n\n---\n\nThis summary is generated and may contain inaccuracies.
