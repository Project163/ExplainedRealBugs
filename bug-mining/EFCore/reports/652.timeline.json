Thanks for handling this so quickly.\n\nNow that I think about, it's still not quite correct, as it doesn't take into account `UNION ALL` (as well as `INTERSECT ALL` which is allowed on Postgres). For example:\n```cs\na.Concat(b.Union(c))\n```\ngets\n```sql\nSELECT id\nFROM Tests\nUNION ALL\nSELECT id\nFROM Tests\nUNION\nSELECT Id\nFROM Tests\n```\nwhere it should have the second and third parameterized together. You can see the difference in [this fiddle](https://dbfiddle.uk/UFRzfgu2). The same thing applies the other way round, although some cases might be OK due to not having the `ALL` implying `DISTINCT` anyway.\n\nI think we'd need to check that property as well. Something like:\n```cs\n    && (operand.Tables[0] is ExceptExpression ||\n            operand.Tables[0].GetType() != setOperation.GetType()) ||\n            operant.Tables[0] is SetOperationBase setOp1 && setOp1.IsDistinct == setOperation.IsDistinct)\n```\nTo be honest it's probably best to make the code more OOP by moving the whole check into the `SetOperationBase` and/or its derived

catch, I should have thought about this with a bit more scope too. Submitted #36124 to add the check for distinctness.\n\n> To be honest it's probably best to make the code more OOP by moving the whole check into the SetOperationBase and/or its derived classes.\n\nNot sure this is a good direction: parentheses logic is something that's 100% a SQL generation question, and so is only the concern of QuerySqlGenerator. When working with expression trees, this is often how it works - the expression types themselves tend to be data-only nodes, and the logic is in the pipeline of visitors.\n\nBTW if you're interested in evaluation order and parentheses, check out QuerySqlGenerator.RequiresParentheses() and TryGetOperatorInfo() which it runs on top of. The latter is responsible for determining the precedence of an operator and whether it's associative (or commutative), and the former uses that information to determine whether to generate parentheses or not. But this is all about **scalar** operators, and so does not apply to set operations.\n\nNote also that operator precedence may differ across providers, which is another good reason to keep this logic in the visitor (which can be overridden/customized by providers) rather than more it into the expression types themselves (which are universal).\n\nAnyway...

more!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2903669490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17785744731,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAPaMMs63SFj9zwAAAAQkHO1b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/17785744731","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-23T08:22:40Z","rename":{"from":"Nested

In addition, the SQLite provider didn't generate parentheses at all, since the SQLite syntax is non-standard and we originally thought no form of parentheses was possible.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nThe missing parentheses could cause the SQL set operators to be evaluated in an incorrect order (compared to the user's specified evaluation order in the LINQ query). This could lead to incorrect results getting returned from the database (data corruption).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nReported by a user.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nAdded.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nVery low. This is a minimal, targeted fix which only adds parentheses to preserve the LINQ evaluation order. A quirk was added just in case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
