Thanks for the reply.  Since my original post, I've implemented a custom `ExecutionStrategy` that explicitly closes the connection, waits 5 seconds and then re-opens it (via an override of `OnRetry()`) - seems to be working fine but if I don't need to go to all that trouble, I'm definitely interested in changing my implementation.\r\n\r\n> In most cases a retriable exception puts the connection in a Broken state, so it will be closed and reopened\r\n\r\nCan you point me to the code that sets the connection state to Broken when a retriable exception occurs? I dug through the EFCore repo and couldn't find anything obvious. I'd like to confirm exactly what happens on an exception and modify my code accordingly.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1104335751/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"martyt","id":3867474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Njc0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3867474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt","html_url":"https://github.com/martyt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6465504445,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5H3i5pzwAAAAGBX8S9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/6465504445","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-20T18:48:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6465504453,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs5H3i5pzwAAAAGBX8TF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/6465504453","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-20T18:48:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1104360652","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/27826#issuecomment-1104360652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27826","id":1104360652,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5B0zTM","user":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-20T1

implementation?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1177641624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MNF","id":825181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTE4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF","html_url":"https://github.com/MNF","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MNF/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6951985494,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5H3i5pzwAAAAGeXuFW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/6951985494","actor":{"login":"martyt","id":3867474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Njc0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3867474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt","html_url":"https://github.com/martyt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-07T13:46:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6951985503,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs5H3i5pzwAAAAGeXuFf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/6951985503","actor":{"login":"martyt","id":3867474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Njc0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3867474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt","html_url":"https://github.com/martyt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-07T13:46:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1177693669","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/27826#issuecomment-1177693669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27826","id":1177693669,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5GMi3l","user":{"login":"martyt","id":3867474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Njc0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3867474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt","html_url":"https://github.com/martyt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martyt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-07T14:21:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T14:21:05Z","body":"@MNF
