This makes all EF console applications break immediately when published as trimmed.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about ensuring minimal functionality of EF console apps with aggressive trimming. Some caveats:\r\n\r\n* Some specific patterns may be necessary in user code in order to ensure that certain user types/members in the model aren't trimmed away. We will document these caveats.\r\n* EF will by no means be fully trimming-compatible, and no guarantees are given to the correct working of user applications. This is a best-effort work item; full compatibility with trimming will be explored in future versions of EF.\r\n\r\n/cc @DamianEdwards @davidfowl @vitek-karas ","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29092/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
