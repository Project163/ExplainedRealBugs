Although EF Core 5.0 was never officially trimming-compatible, at least basic scenarios were possible.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nCoverage will be added in 7.0, where trimming will be a focus. The fix was verified manually.\r\n\r\nNote that EF Core 6.0 still won't be fully trimming-compatible, but this unlocks at least the basic SQLite scenarios which customers were asking for.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nVery low - the fix only adds an attribute which is meaningful only to the linker.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThis uses the [DynamicDependency] attribute to make sure System.DateOnly and TimeOnly aren't trimmed when using EF Core.\r\n\r\nFixes #27311\r\nSimilar to #27098\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6516040540,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5Co_krzwAAAAGEYuNc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/6516040540","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:13:06Z","label":{"name":"closed-fixed","color":"777777"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1112332127","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/27311#issuecomment-1112332127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27311","id":1112332127,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5CTNdf","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-28T15:14:05Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T15:14:05Z","body":"Submitted #27910 for patching this in 6.0.
