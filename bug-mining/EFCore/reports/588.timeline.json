could revisit this... AFAIK we simply follow the documented LINQ behavior here: Enumerable.Max throws for no elements, and the behavior here is clearly [documented](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.queryable.max?view=net-9.0#system-linq-queryable-max-1(system-linq-iqueryable((-0)))) (`source contains no elements`).\n\nA trick to do this currently without roundtrip is the following:\n\n```c#\nvar max = await context.Blogs.GroupBy(b => 1).Select(g => g.Max(b => b.Id)).FirstOrDefaultAsync();\n```\n\nThis selects out the maximum ID if there are any rows, and zero otherwise. The SQL here isn't ideal:\n\n```sql\nSELECT TOP(1) MAX([b0].[Id])\nFROM (\n    SELECT [b].[Id], 1 AS [Key]\n    FROM [Blogs] AS [b]\n) AS [b0]\nGROUP BY [b0].[Key]\n```\n\n... but it probably doesn't

I missed that this was about Cosmos specifically, and also had a mistaken idea of our behavior in relational.\n\n@ajcvickers so it seems that in relational we actually **don't** throw for Min/Max/Average over the empty set, when the return value is nullable. In other words, in #29447 the user expected us to return e.g. int.MinValue for Max over **non-nullable** int, which we obviously don't do. But here the question is Max over **nullable** int.\n\nThe enumerable versions of Min/Max/Average also return null when the type is nullable, so our relational behavior is aligned with that:\n\n```c#\nint?[] ints = [];\nConsole.WriteLine(ints.Max() is null); // True\n```\n\nSo I think we should indeed treat this as a regression for 8.0 and fix it... Does that sound right @ajcvickers?
