What problem are you trying to solve? -->\r\n\r\nThis is a spin-off of #20604, addressing a specific scenario related to the translation of ToString() as a database-side cast.\r\n\r\nThe goal of #20604 is to translate ToString() as a database-side cast. Let's say I have an entity: \r\n\r\n```C#\r\n\r\npublic class Order\r\n{\r\n    public int OrderId { get; set; }\r\n    public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWIth an `OrderStatus` enum:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic enum OrderStatus\r\n{\r\n    New,\r\n    Processing,\r\n    Shipped,\r\n    Delivered\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a DbContext, where the `Status` property is stored in the database as a string:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class MyContext : DbContext\r\n{\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);\r\n\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Order>()\r\n            .Property(o => o.Status)\r\n            .HasConversion<string>();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, I can cast the `Status` enum property to a string and call .Contains off of that if I want the ability to search statuses:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\ndb.Orders.Where(x => ((string)(object)x.Status).Contains(\"Del\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich gets translated to the following SQL:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT [o].[OrderId], [o].[Status]\r\nFROM [Order] AS [o]\r\nWHERE CHARINDEX(N'Del', CAST([o].[Status] AS nvarchar(max))) > 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter #20604 is resolved, this will allow the following C# code:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\ndb.Orders.Where(x => x.Status.ToString().Contains(\"Del\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo also translate to the SQL above.\r\n\r\nThe results of this translated database query match what a client-side evaluation of that LINQ query would return when the `Status` property is stored in the database as a string, but will return different results from a client-side evaluation if the property is stored in the database as a number.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the solution you'd like -->\r\nIn order to align the results of both the client-side evaluation and database query (similar to the reasoning behind #14205), when the `Status` property is stored as a number, I would like to see the following C# code:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\ndb.Orders.Where(x => x.Status.ToString().Contains(\"Del\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nTranslated to the following SQL:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT [o].[OrderId], [o].[Status]\r\nFROM [Order] AS [o]\r\nWHERE CHARINDEX(N'Del', CASE\r\n    WHEN [o].[Status]= 0 THEN 'New'\r\n    WHEN [o].[Status] = 1 THEN 'Processing'\r\n    WHEN [o].[Status] = 2 THEN 'Shipped'\r\n    WHEN [o].[Status] = 3 THEN 'Delivered'\r\n    ELSE ''\r\nEND) > 0\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33635/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
