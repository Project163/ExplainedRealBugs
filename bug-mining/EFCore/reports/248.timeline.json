Where supported, such collections are also fully queryable via the regular LINQ operators.\n\nAs a by-product of this, the translation for `intParam.Contains(b => b.Property)` would be changed from the current IN with constants translation to a string parameter containing an JSON array, which would be unpacked at the database and queried via the standard means.

The application uses an aggregate type ```ContactDetails``` which has a ```DateTime``` property ```DOB```.\r\nWhile inserting some data in the table, I see the associated JSON column has following data.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\"DOB\":\"2023-02-03T00:00:00\",\r\n\"Phone\":\"01632 12345\",\r\n\"Address\":\r\n\t{\r\n\t\"City\":\"Camberwick Green\",\r\n\t\"Country\":\"UK\",\r\n\t\"Postcode\":\"CW1 5ZH\",\r\n\t\"Street\":\"1 Main St\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease notice, the ```DOB``` field has value ```2023-02-03T00:00:00```.\r\n\r\nI want to ask from database providers perspective if EFCore databse providers have any control over how the values are populated for JSON column.\r\nFor Ex:- A database  may not understand the ```DOB``` field value format in which it is currently inserted, and they may want to insert the ```DOB``` field value in a different format.\r\n\r\nTried using converters  (For Ex:- using ```DateTimeToStringConverter```) in the provider for the DateTimeTypeMapping doesn't seem a good idea to resolve this since then the converter will be used for the ```non-JSON DateTime``` field as well. \r\n\r\nFor Ex:- If an application has following entities-\r\n```C#\r\npublic class ContactDetails\r\n    {\r\n      public Address Address { get; set; } = null!;\r\n      public string? Phone { get; set; }\r\n      public DateTime DOB { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Address\r\n    {\r\n      public Address(string street, string city, string postcode, string country)\r\n      {\r\n        Street = street;\r\n        City = city;\r\n        Postcode = postcode;\r\n        Country = country;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      public string Street { get; set; }\r\n      public string City { get; set; }\r\n      public string Postcode { get; set; }\r\n      public string Country { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Author\r\n    {\r\n      public int Id { get; set; }\r\n      public string Name { get; set; }\r\n      public DateTime JoinDate { get; set; }\r\n      public ContactDetails Contact { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, Can it be allowed by the database providers to not use any converter for ```JoinDate``` property which is a non-JSON property, but use some kind of converter for the ```DOB``` property which is a JSON field property, while providing TypeMapping for the entity properties?\r\nOr Is there any other way to achieve this without using converters?\r\nCurrently I am not able to do so.\r\n\r\nHere is the sample application I am using.\r\n```C#\r\nusing System;\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Storage.ValueConversion;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Reflection.Emit;\r\n\r\nnamespace test\r\n{\r\n  class Program\r\n  {\r\n    public class ContactDetails\r\n    {\r\n      public Address Address { get; set; } = null!;\r\n      public string?

We currently translate to OPENJSON without WITH for that reason, but that just returns a string which we can't easily then decode as base64.\r\n* The same problem exists with our general usage of JSON_VALUE to extract scalars - it just extracts a string.\r\n* The only way to make this work is to use OPENJSON yet again - this time with WITH - just for the base64 conversion:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT y.bar\r\nFROM OPENJSON('[\"AAAwOQ==\", \"AAEJMg==\"]') AS x\r\nCROSS APPLY OPENJSON('[\"' + x.value + '\"]') WITH (bar VARBINARY(MAX) '$') AS y\r\nORDER BY

fact, trying to decode a non-base64 fails very explicitly with:\r\n-- Cannot convert a string value found in the JSON text to binary value because it is not Base64 encoded.\r\nSELECT * FROM OPENJSON('[\"foo\"]') WITH (bar VARBINARY(MAX) '$');\r\n\r\n-- However, OPENJSON with WITH doesn't support preserving the original order.\r\n-- For that we use OPENJSON without WITH, but then we need

This has a very detrimental impact on SQL Server itself because:\r\n1. The query hash is different for each distinct set of IDs passed in.\r\n2. SQL Server needs to calculate a plan for each of these distinct combinations (CPU hit).\r\n3. The query plans created occupy an entry in SQL Server's plan cache (unless ad-hoc behavior is on), fighting for resources on other plans and cascading CPU issues by re-calculations due to evictions.\r\n\r\nNote: when SQL Server has memory pressure, plan cache is the first thing to empty. So this has a profound impact at scale, doubly so when things have gone sideways.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nHere's a reduced down version of the problem:\r\n```c#\r\nvar ids = Enumerable.Range(1, 1000).ToList();\r\nvar throwAwary = context.Users.Where(u => ids.Contains(u.Id)).ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in the following:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT [u].[Id],

993, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1000);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\nEF Core version: `2.1.4`\r\nDatabase Provider: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`\r\nOperating system: `Windows 2016/Windows 10`\r\nIDE: `Visual Studio 2017 15.9`\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nEF Core should parameterize here. Instead of `IN (1, 2, 3, ...)` we should see `IN (@__ids1, @__ids2, @__ids3, ...)` or similar. This would allow query plan cache to be shared. For example if we ran this 1,000 times to fetch 1,000,000 users in batches, we'd have *1* plan in cache, whereas today we have 1,000 plans. Let's say a user gets removed (or added!) on page 2 of 1,000...today we'd calculate and cache another 999 plans next run.\r\n\r\nTo further address the cardinality problem, an approach similar to what Dapper does would be at least a starting point. We generate only lists of certain sizes, let's just say 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000. Here's an example with 3 parameters:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT [u].[Id], [u].[AcceptRateAccepted], [u].[AcceptRateAsked], [u].[AccountId], [u].[AnswerCount], [u].[BronzeBadges], [u].[CreationDate], [u].[DaysVisitedConsecutive], [u].[DaysVisitedTotal], [u].[DisplayName], [u].[Email], [u].[Flags], [u].[GoldBadges], [u].[HasAboutMeExcerpt], [u].[HasReplies], [u].[IsVeteran], [u].[JobSearchStatus], [u].[LastAccessDate], [u].[LastDailySiteAccessDate], [u].[LastEmailDate], [u].[LastLoginDate], [u].[LastLoginIP], [u].[LastModifiedDate], [u].[Location], [u].[OptInEmail], [u].[PreferencesRaw], [u].[ProfileImageUrl], [u].[QuestionCount], [u].[RealName], [u].[Reputation], [u].[ReputationMonth], [u].[ReputationQuarter], [u].[ReputationSinceLastCheck], [u].[ReputationToday], [u].[ReputationWeek], [u].[ReputationYear], [u].[SignupStarted], [u].[SilverBadges], [u].[TeamId], [u].[TeamName], [u].[TimedPenaltyDate], [u].[Title], [u].[UserTypeId], [u].[WebsiteUrl]\r\nFROM [Users] AS [u]\r\nWHERE [u].[Id] IN (@ids1, @ids2, @ids3, @ids4, @ids5);\r\n```\r\nThe 5 Ids are so that 1-5 values all use the same plan. Anything < `n` in length repeats the last value (don't use `null`!). In this case let's say our values are `1`, `2`, and `3`. Our parameterization would be:\r\n- `@ids1 = 1;`\r\n- `@ids2 = 2;`\r\n- `@ids3 = 3;`\r\n- `@ids4 = 3;`\r\n- `@ids5 = 3;`\r\n\r\nThis fetches the users we want, is friendly to the cache, and lessens the amount of generated permutations for all layers.\r\n\r\nTo put this in perspective, at Stack Overflow scale we're generating **millions** of one-time-use plans needlessly in EF Core (the parameterization in Linq2Sql lowered this to only cardinality permutations). We alleviate the cache issue by enabling ad-hoc query mode on our SQL Servers, but that doesn't lessen the CPU use from all the query hashes involved except in the (very rare) reuse case of the exact same list.\r\n\r\nThis problem is dangerous because it's also hard to see. If you're looking at the plan cache, you're not going to see it by any sort of impact query analysis. Each query, hash, and plan is different. There's no sane way to group them. It's death by a thousand cuts you can't see. I'm currently finding and killing as many of these in our app as I can, but we should fix this at the source for everyone.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/13617/reactions","total_count":287,"+1":273,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":9,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/13617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-25T14:08:08Z","updated_at":"2023-05-25T14:08:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30677","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30677/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30677/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30677/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30677","id":1664608113,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPaMMs5jN-dx","number":30677,"title":"Add

This is somewhat similar to GenerateNonNullSqlLiteral, but for values inside JSON. In simple cases (int, string), no special logic is needed; but in certain cases, we need to precisely control the representation. For example, a NetTopologySuite Geometry would likely need to be serialized as WKT, which isn't necessarily what ToString returns.\r\n\r\nNote the interaction between this issue and #30604, which is about switching to the lower-level Utf8JsonReader/Utf8JsonWriter APIs rather than passing through DOM. If/when we do that, the type mappings would be the ones calling specific APIs e.g. on Utf8JsonWriter.\r\n\r\n~In addition to serialization/deserialization, we also need a hook for perform a SQL conversion from the JSON (text) value to the actual store type; this is needed when extracting a value from a JSON document and e.g. comparing them to a regular database column. For example, the JSON representation of a timestamp is ISO8601 (with a T), but in SQLite, a timestamp is typically represented as a timestamp text without the T (and so `datetime()` must be invoked). Similarly, to convert a geometry WKT representation to an actual SQL Server geometry type, a function to parse the WKT needs to be invoked.~ Moving the server-side conversion part to

Since JSON_VALUE always returns nvarchar(4000), we apply a cast to the results based on the model type. For example:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n_ = await ctx.Blogs.Where(b => b.Details.Foo == 8).ToArrayAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\n... translates to:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT [b].[Id], [b].[Name], JSON_QUERY([b].[Details],'$')\r\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\r\nWHERE CAST(JSON_VALUE([b].[Details],'$.Foo') AS int) = 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are issues with this translation:\r\n\r\n* Binary data (varbinary) cannot be extracted in this way: the standard JSON representation for binary data is base64, but a regular relational CAST doesn't do that ([see comment](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727#issuecomment-1561765456)). OPENJSON with WITH does decode base64 data, since it applies a JSON-specific conversion. Binary data specifically is covered by [#33435](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33435).\r\n    * On the other hand, spatial data cannot be converted with OPENJSON with WITH, only with a regular cast. The same may be true of hierarchyid.\r\n    * We need to go through all supported SQL Server types\r\n* JSON_VALUE returns null for strings larger than 4000 (or can throw in strict mode) (see [#29477](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29477)).\r\n* There's good reason to believe that this translation is inefficient compared to OPENJSON with WITH, where the query supplies more information to SQL Server.\r\n    * See [this](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/13617#issuecomment-1556016939) and [this](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/13617#issuecomment-1561125154). Both these comments are about OPENJSON without WITH (and not about JSON_VALUE), and are in the context of primitive collections; but the same principles should hold here as well - needs to be confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe alternative translation would be to use OPENJSON with WITH instead:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT [b].[Id], [b].[Name], JSON_QUERY([b].[Details],'$')\r\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\r\nCROSS APPLY OPENJSON([b].[Details]) WITH ([Foo] int '$.Foo') AS [d]\r\nWHERE [d].[Foo] = 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, every scalar access adds a CROSS APPLY to an OPENJSON invocation, applying the JSON conversion with WITH.\r\n\r\nWhen the property being extracted is known to be a short string in the model (fitting in nvarchar(4000)), we could keep the current JSON_VALUE translation. When the type being extracted is incompatible with OPENJSON with WITH (e.g. geometry), we could do OPENJSON without WITH and then apply a relational cast (we should avoid JSON_VALUE still it truncates).\r\n\r\nNote: consider the indexability of this technique, compared to JSON_VALUE (with computed columns)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30981/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30981/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-28T19:13:33Z","updated_at":"2023-05-28T19:13:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30983","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30983/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30983/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30983/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/30983","id":1729625406,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAPaMMs5Ri9Wb","number":30983,"title":"Generate OPENJSON with WITH unless ordering is required","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-05-28T19:13:33Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T12:24:12Z","closed_at":"2023-06-07T12:24:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"repository":{"id":16157746,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE1Nzc0Ng==","name":"efcore","full_name":"dotnet/efcore","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dotnet","id":9141961,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkxNDE5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore","description":"EF Core is a modern object-database mapper for .NET.

PR based based on top of #30976 and #30956, review those first and ignore the first commits here.~\r\n\r\nWe currently generate SQL Server OPENJSON expressions without WITH, applying a regular relational cast to applying the element store type to the output:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWHERE [t].[Id] IN (\r\n    SELECT CAST([i].[value] AS uniqueidentifier) AS [value]\r\n    FROM OPENJSON(@__ids_0) AS [i]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use this form because it allows preserving the ordering of the JSON array (not needed in the above specific query), and that's not possible with the OPENJSON form that accepts WITH.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches to using OPENJSON with WITH in contexts where preserving the ordering isn't needed, such as the above query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWHERE [t].[Id] IN (\r\n    SELECT [i].[value]\r\n    FROM OPENJSON(@__ids_0) WITH ([value] uniqueidentifier '$') AS [i]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere ordering is important, we continue to use OPENJSON without WITH as today.\r\n\r\nCompared to OPENJSON with WITH, OPENJSON without WITH has some performance drawbacks (see https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/13617#issuecomment-1556016939, https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/13617#issuecomment-1561125154). In addition, some conversions from JSON are only possible when using the WITH variant (see https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727#issuecomment-1561765456).\r\n\r\n/cc @yv989c,

In most databases we also translate some spatial functions.\r\n\r\nAs part of #29427, we're allowing to map a .NET collection of any supported type to a JSON column in the database; but since collections of spatial objects have a special representation, we're excluding that specifically. Since GeometryCollection already implements `IEnumerable<Geometry>`, we probably don't want to also allow mapping e.g. `Geometry[]`. However, most database don't allow unpacking a geometry collection to a queryable table (PG supports this via [ST_Dump](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Dump.html)); this means mapping `Geometry[]` to a regular JSON string column in the database does an advantage (queryability) over mapping to a database geometry collection.\r\n\r\nNote: SQL Server OPENJSON doesn't natively support geometry, i.e. does not allow using `geometry` in its WITH clause. But we can still get WKT out as a string and just wrap it in a function which returns the geometry object.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30630/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30630/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9804390697,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5jw0zozwAAAAJIYyEp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/9804390697","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8eed073c2bf4ee99ff1120b694b172d9064982d8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/8eed073c2bf4ee99ff1120b694b172d9064982d8","created_at":"2023-07-12T22:01:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9814453370,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5jw0zozwAAAAJI_Kx6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/9814453370","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"710015aa1e51c2bf9d98a946f8dc2a6a8571f457","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/710015aa1e51c2bf9d98a946f8dc2a6a8571f457","created_at":"2023-07-13T18:41:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T18:52:05Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T18:52:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31261","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31261/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31261/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31261/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31261","id":1803584816,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAPaMMs5Vc2qg","number":31261,"title":"Fixes

Originally I thought we may want to add a general API on the type mappings, but I don't think that makes sense at this point. The conversions needed for SQLite are concentrated in a single simple method, and there's no real value in refactoring that out to the type mappings (SQL Server doesn't need any). We can always change this in the future, but for now I think we should leave this as an internal implementation detail of each provider.\r\n\r\nThe update pipeline doesn't need to perform server-side conversions to JSON; we simply generate the JSON representation we want client-side, and send the appropriate parameter for that (e.g. a JSON string representation of a timestamp). An alternative approach would be to e.g. send a regular DateTime parameter, and then use SQL to convert that to the JSON string representation. But there's no real advantage in that, and it's complex/not always possible. I've done some cleanup/improvement to partial updating in #31232, but I don't think anything else is needed at this point.\r\n\r\n(Note that if we ever want to allow a JSON property to be a key/concurrency token, the update pipeline would need to apply the same conversions as the query pipeline (because it would need to appear in the UPDATE WHERE clause)\r\n\r\nSpecific notes on what's converted and what's not supported:\r\n\r\n* On SQL Server, no SQL conversions are needed.\r\n  * When using OPENJSON with WITH (no ordering preservation), it does the conversion job just fine.\r\n  * When using OPENJSON without WITH (because order needs to be preserved), we add SQL CAST() to convert the JSON value out; this works fine in all cases except for varbinary, since CAST() doesn't handle base64. So varbinary is specifically unsupported in scenarios which require ordering preservation.\r\n* On SQLite:\r\n  * We apply special conversions for DateTime (apply `datetime()` to remove the T) and Guid (uppercase)\r\n  * Decimal, binary and DateTimeOffset are not supported, because there doesn't seem to be a good way to convert them out of JSON.\r\n\r\nRelated to #30727\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9850145877,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5jw0zozwAAAAJLHUxV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/9850145877","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"926b37073d9a721432513ba7fdaee03543cc2d91","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/926b37073d9a721432513ba7fdaee03543cc2d91","created_at":"2023-07-18T13:02:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1643522477","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727#issuecomment-1643522477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727","id":1643522477,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5h9imt","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-20T08:44:14Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T08:44:14Z","body":"Update on this... As previously decided, we ended up implementing some conversions when extracting JSON values out in SQLite (Guid to uppercase, add remove T from timestamp). For some types, it was impossible to reliably convert (binary, decimal, DateTimeOffset); we decided to allow storing these types, but to block their querying as that can't be supported.\r\n\r\nHowever, JSON value extraction is also necessary for the new Contains implementation; this means that it would no longer be possible to do `Where(b => decimals.Contains(b.SomeDecimal)`, which would be a problematic breaking change.\r\n\r\nWe considered two options:\r\n\r\n1. Special-case the JSON representation for parameters (as opposed to columns), and embed a compatible relational representation instead of the standard JSON one (e.g. represent decimals as strings). Since nobody cares about the actual contents of parameter collections, that seemed reasonable. It would mean that column collections of the problematic types remain unqueryable.\r\n2. Simply default to using the SQLite representations everyone in JSON, both columns and parameters. This would also allow querying all types, at the cost of non-standard JSON documents with e.g. decimals as strings.\r\n\r\nSince supporting standard JSON representations has turned out to be increasingly difficult and has added complexity, we've opted for option 2.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n\r\n* We'll switch to the SQLite-specific JSON representation for all types, not just for those we can't reliably convert. For example, DateTime will be stored within the JSON with T, even though we're capable of converting it out (removing the T).\r\n* Users still have the option of explicitly configuring a JsonValueReaderWriter to control the JSON representation, allowing them to implement the standard JSON representation instead. At that point, however, querying the column will almost certainly return incorrect reuslts. We should log a warning for this case.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1643522477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10099112838,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5jw0zozwAAAAJZ9DuG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10099112838","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-15T16:37:55Z","label":{"name":"closed-fixed","color":"777777"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10099114265,"node_id":"CE_lADOAPaMMs5jw0zozwAAAAJZ9EEZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10099114265","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-15T16:38:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1679270206","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727#issuecomment-1679270206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727","id":1679270206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5kF6E-","user":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-15T16:39:29Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T
