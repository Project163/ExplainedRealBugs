\nvar addressEntry = context.Entry(address); \nvar addressETagPropertyName = addressEntry.Metadata.GetETagPropertyName(); \n// we expect a value, but addressETagPropertyName is null.\nvar addressETagProperty = addressEntry.Metadata.GetETagProperty(); \n// we expect a value, but addressETagProperty is null\naddress.Street = \"Street from context 1\";\nawait context1.SaveChangesAsync();\n```\nAt this point I expect that address.CustomETag contains an updated value from db, but the value is not updated.\nIf I do the same test but with Address entity, everything works as expected and described in the documentation.\n\n### Provider and version information\n\nEF Core version: 8.0.10\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos 8.0.10\nTarget framework:  .NET 8.0\nOperating system:\nIDE: (e.g. Visual Studio 2022 17.4)\n\nI also tested this using .NET 6.0 and EF Core 6, and also using >NET 8.0 EF Core 9.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
