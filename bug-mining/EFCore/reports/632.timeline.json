This results in warnings about dependency mismatches:\n\n`Detected package version outside of dependency constraint: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild 4.8.0 requires Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common (= 4.8.0) but version Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common 4.11.0 was resolved.`\n\nWhile the app compiles and runs without errors, this could lead to runtime issues in scenarios where EF Core Design or the conflicting library requires specific features or behaviors from their respective versions of `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common`.\n\n**Proposed Solution**\nConsider updating EF Core Design's dependency constraints to `>= 4.8.0` instead of `= 4.8.0`, or update to a newer version compatible with the latest libraries.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n1. Create a project with EF Core Design v9.0 and Wolverine 3.3 (or any other library with a dependency on Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Common v4.11).\n2. Observe the dependency conflict warning during restore or build.\n\n**Impact**\nThis restrictive dependency constraint creates avoidable warnings and potential runtime issues in projects integrating multiple libraries.\n\nThank you for considering this improvement!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35143/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15801727330,"node_id":"MADE_lADOAPaMMs6V5NrczwAAAAOt2zli","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15801727330","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"marked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-02T19:37:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2568278008","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/34637#issuecomment-2568278008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34637","id":2568278008,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs6ZFM_4","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-02T19:38:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T19:38:03Z","body":"See
