our InExpression supports having a subquery (and various visitors handle that), we never actually generate this  - instead we always generate an EXISTS subquery with a predicate (based on SQL Server baselines). Translating to InExpression is likely better - it doesn't require a correlated subquery and expresses the intent more succintly, without needing a predicate. For example, instead of this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT ...\r\nFROM [PrimitiveCollectionsEntity] AS [p]\r\nWHERE EXISTS (\r\n    SELECT 1\r\n    FROM (\r\n        SELECT TOP(2) CAST([i].[value] AS int) AS [c], CAST([i].[key] AS int) AS [c0]\r\n        FROM OPENJSON([p].[Ints]) AS [i]\r\n        ORDER BY CAST([i].[key] AS int)\r\n    ) AS [t]\r\n    WHERE [t].[c] = 11)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can translate to this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT ...\r\nFROM [PrimitiveCollectionsEntity] AS [p]\r\nWHERE 11 IN (\r\n    SELECT TOP(2) CAST([i].[value] AS int)\r\n    FROM OPENJSON([p].[Ints]) AS [i]\r\n    ORDER BY CAST([i].[key] AS int)\r\n)\r\n```    \r\n\r\nHowever, note that our null semantics around InExpression with subquery currently seems broken (fortunately it's dead code): IN returns null when the item is null (or when the values contains null and a match isn't found). We'd need to make that logic actually work.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30955/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
