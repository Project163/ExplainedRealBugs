So e.g. `context.Blogs.Select(b => b.Ints)` would get rewritten to `context.Blogs.Select(b => [IncludeExpression].Ints)`. Nav expansion does not do this rewriting for regular property accesses, and so shouldn't do it for primitive collection properties either.\r\n\r\nThis incorrect IncludeExpression was the root cause of #34008 in Cosmos. In relational, owned entities are handled in a special way during translation (ExpandSharedTypeEntities), and this IncludeExpression did not interfere - but it's still incorrect.\r\n\r\nFixes
