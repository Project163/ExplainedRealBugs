In EF 5 this behaviour was not present.\r\n**********************\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nI've encountered strange behaviour of the dotnet ef CLI tool after updating my application to EF 6. `Program.cs` in our microservices looks like this:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Program\r\n{\r\n    public static Task Main(string[] args) => WebHostHelper.BuildAndRunWebHostAsync<Startup>(args, validateDiConfigurationInDebug: true);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs you can see it lacks `CreateHostBuilder(string[] args)` because it wouldn't be productive to add this method in all microservices. Instead, we provide a helper method as above. Also, what is important, our application is implementing `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory` in order to control creating of `DbContext` when migrations are being added (find simple reproduction here: https://github.com/marekott/dotnet-ef-add-migration-bug-reproduction). When application had dependency on EF 5 `dotnet-ef migrations add Initial -v` command produced valid migration (logs below). After updating to EF 6 the same command starts the entire application (logs below) that needs to be killed in order to finish producing migration (which in the end is a valid one). Adding `CreateHostBuilder(string[] args)` resolves this issue, application is not started and migration is generated. However, adding this method especially that it is not used and wasn't needed for 3 years seem as a lazy solution. \r\n\r\nTaking everything into consideration what is a reason for this strange behaviour? It seems like a bug, especially that it has worked previously.\r\n\r\n**Logs for EF 5**\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\marek.ott\\Desktop\\demo\\SampleWebApi\\SampleWebApi> dotnet-ef migrations add Initial\r\nBuild started...\r\nBuild succeeded.\r\nDone.

It seems it doesn't use the design time factory I have implemented and tries to run the host builder instead (which doesn't have any connection string on the build server).\r\n\r\nIf I set a (fake) connection string, everything works fine.
