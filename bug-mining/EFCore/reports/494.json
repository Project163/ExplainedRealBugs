found in our application that due to a large number of generated items `RelationalCommandCache` reached capacity the system would need to do linear searches through MemoryCache's `ConcurrentDictionary` of `CommandCacheKey`s due to them all being in the same bucket since there is a hard-coded `GetHashCode()` of `0`. This avoids the advantages of `ConcurrentDictionary`'s  O(1) lookup time.\r\n\r\nI thought that a simple improvement would be to use `RuntimeHelpers.GetHashCode(_queryExpression)` instead of `0`. This would improve the distribution of buckets in the HashSet while maintaining the contract with the overridden `Equals` while avoiding any hashcode calculation explosion that might happen if we considered the `_parameterValues` that are also used in `Equals` or if an overridden Expression `GetHashCode` looked at the items in the Expression. as mentioned in https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/19859. \r\nSince reference equality is the first thing checking in `Equals` this will be consistent to uniquely find a `CommandCacheKey` ","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
