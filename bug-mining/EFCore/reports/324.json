F#, closure parameters are integrated into the query expression tree as constant nodes - see https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/12841 for the full details. This means that by default, all EF queries generate SQL with constants rather than parameters.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to use a F# ref, which gets properly parameterized by EF Core:\r\n\r\n```f#\r\nlet i = ref 8\r\ndb.Events.Where(fun x -> x.Data = i.Value).ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, while this works well with local variables, it's problematic for use with function parameters, since the parameter needs to be typed as `Ref<T>` (it isn't great to require people to change method signatures just so that an EF query inside get properly parameterized). Note that the variable name is also lost, so the SQL contains `@__Value_0`.\r\n\r\nWe could introduced an EF.Param() mechanism, which is identified by EF Core and forces parameterization. The same mechanism could be used in C# to force parameterization for better perf when two queries use different constants, without needing to extract a variable:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar query1 = await ctx.Blogs.Where(b => b.Name == EF.Param(\"foo\")).ToListAsync();\r\n...\r\nvar query2 = await ctx.Blogs.Where(b => b.Name == EF.Param(\"bar\")).ToListAsync();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF.Param could optionally also accept the SQL parameter name, to produce more readable SQL queries.\r\n\r\n/cc @dsyme @NinoFloris","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28151/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
