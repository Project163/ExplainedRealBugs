I want to be able to keep logging all other kinds of query errors, but not ones for intentional cancellations. In my application, I'm passing aspnetcore's `HttpContext.RequestedAborted` token to my async EF query evaluations. If the client hangs up, there's no reason to keep querying the database working to evaluate what are in some cases quite complex search queries in an intranet application (e.g. if the client changed their search criteria, or just left the page).\r\n\r\nWe'd like to not pollute our logs with these exceptions that are fully expected. We have an `ActionFilter` where we handle the exception as far as aspnetcore is concerned, but EF itself still logs the error.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nfail: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query[10100]\r\n      An exception occurred while iterating over the results of a query for context type 'My.App.AppDbContext'.\r\n      System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException: A task was canceled.\r\n         at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.AsyncQueryingEnumerable`1.AsyncEnumerator.BufferlessMoveNext(DbContext _, Boolean buffer, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n         at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Storage.Internal.SqlServerExecutionStrategy.ExecuteAsync[TState,TResult](TState state, Func`4 operation, Func`4 verifySucceeded, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n         at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.AsyncQueryingEnumerable`1.AsyncEnumerator.MoveNext(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n         at System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable.SelectEnumerableAsyncIterator`2.MoveNextCore(CancellationToken cancellationToken) in D:\\a\\1\\s\\Ix.NET\\Source\\System.Interactive.Async\\Select.cs:line 106\r\n         at System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable.AsyncIterator`1.MoveNext(CancellationToken cancellationToken) in D:\\a\\1\\s\\Ix.NET\\Source\\System.Interactive.Async\\AsyncIterator.cs:line 98\r\n         at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.AsyncLinqOperatorProvider.ExceptionInterceptor`1.EnumeratorExceptionInterceptor.MoveNext(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\nSystem.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException: A task was canceled.\r\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.AsyncQueryingEnumerable`1.AsyncEnumerator.BufferlessMoveNext(DbContext _, Boolean buffer, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Storage.Internal.SqlServerExecutionStrategy.ExecuteAsync[TState,TResult](TState state, Func`4 operation, Func`4 verifySucceeded, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.AsyncQueryingEnumerable`1.AsyncEnumerator.MoveNext(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n   at System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable.SelectEnumerableAsyncIterator`2.MoveNextCore(CancellationToken cancellationToken) in D:\\a\\1\\s\\Ix.NET\\Source\\System.Interactive.Async\\Select.cs:line 106\r\n   at System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable.AsyncIterator`1.MoveNext(CancellationToken cancellationToken) in D:\\a\\1\\s\\Ix.NET\\Source\\System.Interactive.Async\\AsyncIterator.cs:line 98\r\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.Internal.AsyncLinqOperatorProvider.ExceptionInterceptor`1.EnumeratorExceptionInterceptor.MoveNext(CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the solution you'd like -->\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nCreate a dedicated log category for `OperationCanceledException`s that are caused by userspace-provided CancellationTokens that I can then setup a regular logging filter against.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, just do not log `OperationCanceledException` at all if the `CancellationToken` has been triggered, since this is generally always an intentional outcome if the user has passed a `CancellationToken` to their query evaulations.

NPGSQL developers, \n\nVersion 9.0.4(latest)\n\nFor reproduce - i'm create project with all cases by this link https://github.com/Timka654/NPGSQLProblemsResearch1/tree/master\n\nMost time ago i get a problem with connection timeouts to npg database on my project after few hours working, now i found time for research problem source\n\nASP.NET use Kestrel as http server core, by default - kestrel use cancellationToken in request for cancel async operations in building response, and developers not use Task-operations without this token\n\nSo, first problem\n\nOn try connect and cancel in process - log line output in next format\n\n> fail: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Connection[20004]\n>       An error occurred using the connection to database 'db-name' on server 'tcp://end-point:5432'.\n\n\t  \nBut need throw TaskCanceledException without log on error... Cancelled operation is not error for display this to log on fail level, maybe on debug level\n\nSecond problem - its performance, if you have cancelled operation previously\n\nin my test in debug - i have stable ~6000 ops to remote database in my local(home) network without cancellation tokens with default pgsql settings.... \nbut if i try emulate cancel operations - my performance down to ~3 ops, after few reading operations, its critical! as final - this can be problem source of timeout exceptions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/3619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/3619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
