The `CosmosClientWrapper` already received an `IExecutionStrategy` instance and used it for CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Delete, ReadItem), but it was not being used for query execution through `ExecuteSqlQuery` and `ExecuteSqlQueryAsync`.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nCustomers using the Cosmos provider may experience application failures during transient network issues or service unavailability when executing queries. Without ExecutionStrategy, these failures would not be automatically retried, leading to unnecessary exceptions that could have been handled transparently. There are no straightforward workarounds besides implementing custom retry logic at the application level.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nThis was reported by a customer.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nNo. It's a missing part of a feature that has existed since the Cosmos provider's inception.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nThere's currently no way to verify this, we'll have to wait for customer feedback.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. The changes are minimal and surgical, only affecting the actual database call points in `DocumentEnumerable` and `DocumentAsyncEnumerable` while preserving all existing enumeration behavior. The `ExecutionStrategy` pattern is well-established in other providers.\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
