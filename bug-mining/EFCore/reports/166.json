I tried using Local SQL Server and SQLite database, it was freezing with both, so it seems provider independent.\r\n\r\nHere is very shortened part of my entities and mapping:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\npublic abstract class Investment \r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Bond : Investment \r\n{\r\n   public virtual ICollection<Coupon> Coupons { get; set; }\r\n} \r\n\r\npublic class Stock : Investment \r\n{\r\n    public virtual ICollection<Dividend> Dividends { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\npublic abstract class InvestmentYield\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n    public Investment Investment { get; set; }\r\n    public int InvestmentId { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now mapping:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        var investment = modelBuilder.Entity<Investment>();\r\n        investment.UseTpcMappingStrategy();\r\n\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Stock>();\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Bond>();\r\n\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<InvestmentYield>().UseTpcMappingStrategy();\r\n\r\n        // This is the part of code which causes migrations to freeze.\r\n        // To prevent freezes, remove (or comment) code below:\r\n\r\n        var dividend = modelBuilder.Entity<Dividend>();\r\n        dividend.Property(e => e.InvestmentId)\r\n            .HasColumnName(\"stock_id\");\r\n\r\n        dividend.HasOne<Stock>()\r\n            .WithMany(s => s.Dividends)\r\n            .HasForeignKey(e => e.InvestmentId);\r\n\r\n        var coupon = modelBuilder.Entity<Coupon>();\r\n        coupon.Property(e => e.InvestmentId)\r\n            .HasColumnName(\"bond_id\");\r\n\r\n        coupon.HasOne<Bond>()\r\n            .WithMany(b => b.Coupons)\r\n            .HasForeignKey(e => e.InvestmentId);\r\n\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is repo with sample project for reproduction:\r\nhttps://github.com/klinki/ef-core-issue\r\n\r\n### Include verbose output\r\n\r\nHere is verbose output  from `dotnet ef migrations add MappingMigration`.
