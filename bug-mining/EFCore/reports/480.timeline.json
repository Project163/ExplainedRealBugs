is a fundamental problem with using NTWIR and not projecting root entity. For Tracking queries we don't allow that (i.e. we throw), but currently for NTWIR we do. When using change tracker, the problem we can get ourselves into is that collection navigation results are being populated in the order they are being materialized in the query. When parent entity is present we process it in a separate code path (Include), and results of that processing always come first in the materializer code. So, \"full\" JSON collection projections always are discovered and materialized first and therefore all subsequent instances of those collections are populated in the correct (\"original\") order.\r\n\r\nFor no tracking we always materialize everything separately so the problem doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nFor NTWIR, we can have a situation right now where a collection element is projected first, and only later the full collection is projected. In that scenario, in the \"full\" collection, that entity discovered earlier would come first in the list. This is an issue for JSON, because collections are supposed to be ordered.\r\n\r\nExample problematic query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            ss => ss.Set<JsonEntityBasic>().Select(\r\n                x =>

can either do sophisticated ordering of which elements get materialized before which (i.e. full collections before individual element accesses), or block the scenario where you don't project root in NTWIR, just like we do for tracking query.\r\nIn long term the correct fix is to implement Ordered Collections: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/9067, then the issue goes away.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1945179904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1945588071","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33073#issuecomment-1945588071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33073","id":1945588071,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5z91Fn","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-15T08:30:04Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T08:30:04Z","body":"OTOH blocking this scenario (for now) doesn't seem too bad to me. But given that this does work correctly for tracked queries, is it simply an implementation difficulty for the NTWIR code path or something? I mean, if tracking queries can do this correctly without ordered collections, it seems odd that we wouldn't be able to do the same for NTWIT no?\r\n\r\nIn any case, we may really want to have a design discussion on whether we want to continue investing in owned entity JSON mapping - as opposed to complex types. Unless I'm mistaken, this wouldn't be a problem with complex types, since we don't do identity resolution on them anyway (i.e. we'd project different instances, just like in the no-tracking case?).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1945588071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1947440372","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33073#issuecomment-1947440372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33073","id":1947440372,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs50E5T0","user":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-15T22:27:00Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T22:27:00Z","body":"NTWIT works fine for the case where you also project parent entity (just like regular Tracking), after fix from https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33101 is applied.
