Question\n\nI have a base class with derived classes that look like this:\n\n```\npublic abstract class BaseClass\n{\n    public Guid Id { get; set; }\n    public string PartitionKey { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n}\n\npublic class DerivedClass1 : BaseClass\n{\n    public string PropertyA { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n}\n\npublic class DerivedClass2 : BaseClass\n{\n    public int PropertyB { get; set; }\n}\n```\nModeled in EF Core like so:\n\n```\nmodelBuilder.Entity<BaseClass>(entity =>\n{\n     entity.HasKey(e => e.Id);\n     entity.HasPartitionKey(e => e.PartitionKey);\n\n     entity.HasDiscriminator()\n         .HasValue<DerivedClass1>(\"DerivedClass1\")\n         .HasValue<DerivedClass2>(\"DerivedClass2\")\n         .IsComplete(true);\n});\n```\nAnd a repository method to get a single entity by ID:\n\n```\npublic async Task<BaseClass?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id, string partitionKey)\n{\n    return await dbContext.BaseClasses\n        .SingleAsync(c => c.PartitionKey == partitionKey && c.Id == id);\n}\n```\n\nSince I'm providing an ID and partition key, I would expect this to be a point read. But the EF Core logs show that a query is being performed. The addition of $type in the WHERE clause should be unnecessary since the PK and ID uniquely identify a single entity.\n\n```\nExecuted ReadNext (134.5222 ms, 3.03 RU) ActivityId='94f49da8-7517-43d7-9d1e-36b6e16798ec', Container='containerName', Partition='?', Parameters=[@__id_0=?]\n      SELECT VALUE c\n      FROM root c\n      WHERE ((c[\"$type\"] IN (\"DerivedClass1\", \"DerivedClass1\") AND (c[\"Id\"] = @__id_0))\n      OFFSET 0 LIMIT 2\n```\nBased on my reading of the documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/cosmos/querying), this repository method should perform a point read.
