:rotating_light: The automated release from the `master` branch failed. :rotating_light:\n\nI recommend you give this issue a high priority, so other packages depending on you can benefit from your bug fixes and new features again.\n\nYou can find below the list of errors reported by **semantic-release**. Each one of them has to be resolved in order to automatically publish your package. I’m sure you can fix this 💪.\n\nErrors are usually caused by a misconfiguration or an authentication problem. With each error reported below you will find explanation and guidance to help you to resolve it.\n\nOnce all the errors are resolved, **semantic-release** will release your package the next time you push a commit to the `master` branch. You can also manually restart the failed CI job that runs **semantic-release**.\n\nIf you are not sure how to resolve this, here are some links that can help you:\n- [Usage documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/usage/README.md)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/caribou/docs/support/FAQ.md)\n- [Support channels](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#get-help)\n\nIf those don’t help, or if this issue is reporting something you think isn’t right, you can always ask the humans behind **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new)**.\n\n---\n\n### The release `10.0.0` on branch `master` cannot be published as it is out of range.\n\nBased on the releases published on other branches, only versions within the range `>=9.20.1 <10.0.0` can be published from branch `master`.\n\nThe following commits are responsible for the invalid release:\n- Merge pull request #725 from sitkoru/beta (34a62c6b)\n- fix(grpc): fix for empty environment on grpc service in consul (89fa1712)\n- fix(ci): set postgres hostname for new dbcontext (70de73c4)\n-

commits should be moved to a valid branch with [git merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) or [git cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) and removed from branch `master` with [git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) or [git reset](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset).\n\nA valid branch could be `next`.\n\nSee the [workflow configuration documentation](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/workflow-configuration.md) for more details.\n\n---\n\nGood luck with your project ✨\n\nYour

CONSTRAINT generic_table1_pkey PRIMARY KEY (\"Id\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\nAnd have a bit of code like the following\r\n```C#\r\n    public class MyDbContext1 : DbContext\r\n    {\r\n        public DbSet<GenericTable1> T1 { get; set; }\r\n        public DbSet<GenericTable1<GenericTableData1>> T2 { get; set; }\r\n        public DbSet<GenericTable1<GenericTableData2>> T3 { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(\"Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=testdb;User

works fine without any issues:\r\n```C#\r\n//this works\r\nusing (var context = new MyDbContext1())\r\n{\r\n     var data = context.T2.Where(x => x.Id > 0).ToList();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Scenario 2\r\n\r\nNow if we create another table, pretty much the same as before (note that column names are snake_case):\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.generic_table2\r\n(\r\n    id bigint NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY ( INCREMENT 1 START 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807 CACHE 1 ),\r\n    type_id bigint,\r\n    content text COLLATE pg_catalog.\"default\",\r\n    CONSTRAINT generic_table2_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the code (note the 'Column' attributes:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n    public class MyDbContext2 : DbContext\r\n    {\r\n        public DbSet<GenericTable2> T1 { get; set; }\r\n        public DbSet<GenericTable2<GenericTableData1>> T2 { get; set; }\r\n        public DbSet<GenericTable2<GenericTableData2>> T3 { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(\"Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=testdb;User Id=postgres;Password=123456\");\r\n\r\n            base.OnConfiguring(optionsBuilder);\r\n        }\r\n        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n

[Table(\"generic_table2\")]\r\n    public class GenericTable2\r\n    {\r\n        [Key]\r\n        [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]\r\n        [Column(\"id\")]\r\n        public long Id { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Column(\"type_id\")]\r\n        public long TypeId { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class GenericTable2<T> : GenericTable2\r\n    {\r\n        [Column(\"content\")]\r\n        public T Content { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd to run it:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n//this doesn't work\r\nusing (var context = new MyDbContext2())\r\n{\r\n      var data = context.T2.Where(x => x.Id > 0).ToList();\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt throws:\r\n`'GenericTable2<GenericTableData1>.Content' and 'GenericTable2<GenericTableData2>.Content' are both mapped to column 'content' in 'generic_table', but are configured to use differing provider types ('GenericTableData1' and 'GenericTableData2').`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stack trace\r\n```\r\n   at

For example, consider this table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE [Members] (\r\n    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,\r\n    [Name] nvarchar(max) NULL,\r\n    [IsActive] bit NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST(1 AS bit),\r\n    CONSTRAINT [PK_Member] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF8 now parses literal values in column default constraints, allowing `HasDefaultValue` to be scaffolded instead of `HasDefaultValyeSql`. For example, `CAST(1 AS bit)` is parsed as `true`:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Member>(entity =>\r\n{\r\n    entity.Property(e => e.IsActive).HasDefaultValue(true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF checks the value of a property to determine whether or not to let the database generate a value. Starting with EF8, [this check can be customized](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/701). This means that EF8 will send `false` to the database when needed, since database default is known to be `true`. \r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n- Major progress on value objects with the merge of [_Add complex types to Metadata_](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31003).\r\n- A PR with changes to JSON serialization is [out for review](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31160)\r\n- Unfortunately, the [T4 tooling changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/plan#first-class-t4-templates-in-visual-studio) planned for Visual Studio have been cut.\r\n\r\n## EF Core 8 (EF8)\r\n\r\nEF Core 8 (EF8) will be the next release after EF Core 7.0.
