Problem is that RelationalSplitCollectionShaperExpression has its own SelectExpression that described the collection - we should use that select expression rather than the parent.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nSome queries using split query and AsNoTrackingWithIdentityResolution fail during compilation with a cryptic error (index out of range) there is no good workaround outside of not using split query and/or AsNoTrackingWithIdentityResolution. The scenario is quite niche, requiring two query customizations (split query and AsNoTrackingWithIdentityResolution) as well as a specific shape.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer reported on 9 RC1.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nYes, introduced in 9 while attempting to fix another regression from EF8 (https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33073)\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nMultiple tests added.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. Change is straightforward - updating the state used in one of our visitors, we use that strategy in numerous places. The visitor itself is used for validation - it doesn't manipulate the shape of the query.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14372609264,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs6XYdBKzwAAAANYrJzw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/14372609264","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-24T00:12:59Z","label":{"name":"closed-fixed","color":"777777"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14385062242,"node_id":"CE_lADOAPaMMs6XYdBKzwAAAANZaqFi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/14385062242","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-24T16:55:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14385062303,"node_id":"CE_lADOAPaMMs6XYdBKzwAAAANZaqGf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/14385062303","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"00b08d73f9bf75d77375330e06a5a92180005d2f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/00b08d73f9bf75d77375330e06a5a92180005d2f","created_at":"2024-09-24T16:55:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14386235877,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs6XYdBKzwAAAANZfInl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/14386235877","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m
