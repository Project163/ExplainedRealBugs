This resulted in the not-null ternary executing in about ~6s, while the null-conditioned ternary would run in ~33s.\n\nUpgrading the codebase to EF Core 9 (in order to file this bug report) I noticed the not-null conditioned ternary had regressed to the same performance as the null conditioned ternary due to changes in the generated SQL.\n\n### Your code\n\nI'm using the following predicate as part of the template:\n\n```csharp\nr => Template.SupplyOrderId != null\n    ? r.SourcePallet.SupplyOrderId == Template.SupplyOrderId\n    : r.SourcePallet.Id == Template.ActivePalletId\n```\n\nIn EF Core 8, this resulted in the following SQL (subquery only):\n\n```sql\nSELECT [w].[NetWeight], 1 AS [Key]\nFROM [WasteRegistrations] AS [w]\nINNER JOIN [SourcePallet] AS [s3] ON [w].[SourcePalletId] = [s3].[Id]\nWHERE CASE\n    WHEN [s].[SupplyOrderId] IS NOT NULL THEN CASE\n        WHEN [s3].[SupplyOrderId] = [s].[SupplyOrderId] AND [s3].[SupplyOrderId] IS NOT NULL THEN CAST(1 AS bit)\n        ELSE CAST(0 AS bit)\n    END\n    ELSE CASE\n        WHEN [s3].[Id] = [p3].[ActivePalletId] AND [p3].[ActivePalletId] IS NOT NULL THEN CAST(1 AS bit)\n        ELSE CAST(0 AS bit)\n    END\nEND = CAST(1 AS bit)\n```\n\nHere `p3.ActivePalletId` is `int?`, `s.SupplyOrderId` is `int?` as well.\n\nin EF Core 9, the subquery is as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT [w].[NetWeight], 1 AS [Key]\nFROM [WasteRegistrations] AS [w]\nINNER JOIN [SourcePallet] AS [s4] ON [w].[SourcePalletId] = [s4].[Id]\nWHERE CASE\n    WHEN [s].[SupplyOrderId] IS NOT NULL THEN ~CAST([s4].[SupplyOrderId] ^ [s].[SupplyOrderId] AS bit)\n    ELSE ~CAST([s4].[Id] ^ [p3].[ActivePalletId] AS bit)\nEND = CAST(1 AS bit)\n```\n\nThe EF8 query results in a filter on the `SourcePallet` table, which in turn requires a **Clustered Index Seek** on the `WasteRegistrations` table to find the accompanying waste registrations. With EF9 however, the subquery causes a **CLustered Index Scan**, because (my assumption) it can no longer digest what source it should use to match the `s4.SupplyOrderId` part of the query. I also have my doubts how this behavior will affect filtered indexes, but I think it renders them moot due to the way the query is now built.\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\nNA.\n```\n\n### Verbose output\n\n```text\nNA.\n```\n\n### EF Core version\n\n9.0.6\n\n### Database provider\n\nMicrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\n\n### Target framework\n\n.NET 8.0\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 11\n\n### IDE\n\nVisual Studio 2022 17.4","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
