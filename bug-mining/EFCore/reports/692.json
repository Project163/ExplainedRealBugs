Bug description\n\nWhen using any version past 10.0.0-rc.1.25413.3 of the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tasks package, vs studio gives an warning/error about the project referencing it, and makes the project completely unloadable, the error is about the buildTransitive/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tasks.props file, and simply replacing the latest package one for the one from the version cited as working, fixes the issue.\n\n<img width=\"423\" height=\"259\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29542e5d-6f2d-4e18-be0a-c8ee31fd64bd\" />\n\n### Your
