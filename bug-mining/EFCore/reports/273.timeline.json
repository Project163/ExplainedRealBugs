In most databases we also translate some spatial functions.\r\n\r\nAs part of #29427, we're allowing to map a .NET collection of any supported type to a JSON column in the database; but since collections of spatial objects have a special representation, we're excluding that specifically. Since GeometryCollection already implements `IEnumerable<Geometry>`, we probably don't want to also allow mapping e.g. `Geometry[]`. However, most database don't allow unpacking a geometry collection to a queryable table (PG supports this via [ST_Dump](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Dump.html)); this means mapping `Geometry[]` to a regular JSON string column in the database does an advantage (queryability) over mapping to a database geometry collection.\r\n\r\nNote: SQL Server OPENJSON doesn't natively support geometry, i.e. does not allow using `geometry` in its WITH clause. But we can still get WKT out as a string and just wrap it in a function which returns the geometry object.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30630/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30630/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10525483074,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5ybqslzwAAAAJzXiBC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10525483074","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"889c9d3e241f67ec6996e2c8f3bd257b67fd1950","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/889c9d3e241f67ec6996e2c8f3bd257b67fd1950","created_at":"2023-10-02T12:27:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-02T12:30:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T12:30:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31930","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31930/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31930/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31930/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31930","id":1921824999,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAPaMMs5bqwVT","number":31930,"title":"[release/8.0]

#31912\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe primitive collection improvements to 8.0 changed the translation of Contains to use OPENJSON with WITH, but that's incompatible with hierarchyid (SQL Server CLR type).\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nQueries which apply Contains to a parameter list of HierarchyId no longer work in 8.0.\r\n\r\n### How found\r\n\r\nCustomer reported.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nYes (when the community hierarchyid package was used)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nVery low, the mechanism to transform the incompatible OPENJSON with WITH to OPENJSON without WITH already existed for other purposes; this change only extends its usage for hierarchyid.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31930/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10525512159,"node_id":"AE_lADOAPaMMs5ybqslzwAAAAJzXpHf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10525512159","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-02T12:30:37Z","assignee":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10525513501,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5ybqslzwAAAAJzXpcd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10525513501","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-02T12:30:46Z","label":{"name":"type-bug","color":"f7c6c7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10525513513,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5ybqslzwAAAAJzXpcp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10525513513","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-02T12:30:46Z","label":{"name":"area-query","color":"32b37b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10525513530,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5ybqslzwAAAAJzXpc6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10525513530","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VX
