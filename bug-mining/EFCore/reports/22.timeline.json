However, since we have disabled the period, renaming also needs to happen for both tables now and we don't do it. So the column is only renamed for the temporal table and the name in history table stays the same. When we try to switch versioning back on the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nFix is to flow the information to ColumnOperations that the column is part of a temporal table and when we process the migrations, if the versioning for the temporal table has been disabled, mirror the rename operation(s) to the history table also.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\n\r\nRemoving a column from a temporal table and performing another operation on that table in the same migration will create a faulty migration - sql exception will be thrown when trying to apply it. Workaround is splitting the drop column operation into a separate migration. For some operations, reordering the migration steps (moving drop column after the other ones) can also help.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\n\r\nReported by a customer.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\n\r\nNo. Temporal tables is a new feature in 6.0.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nAdded a number of tests performing drop column alongside other operations.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow+. Risk is low, but greater than some other small fixes submitted recently. Now we add temporal annotations to every column in the temporal table - whereas before we used to only do this for period columns. This could result in us treating any column as if it was a period column *IF* we missed some hidden assumptions. This shouldn't make much of an impact and we added a lot of tests for extra coverage, but the risk exists nonetheless and should be pointed out. Added quirk to revert to old behavior to further mitigate the

However, since we have disabled the period, renaming (and other operations) also needs to happen for both tables now and we don't do it. So the column is only renamed for the temporal table and the name in history table stays the same. When we try to switch versioning back on the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nFix is to flow the information to ColumnOperations that the column is part of a temporal table and when we process the

encountered an issue when, in the same migration, I try to add a new column and drop an existing one in a table with the `SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON` setting. \r\n\r\nA quick debug through an empty custom `SqlServerMigrationsSqlGenerator` to look at the operations executed showed that the following order is applied:\r\n\r\n- SYSTEM_VERSION=OFF\r\n- DROP COLUMN\r\n- ADD COLUMN\r\n- SYSTEM_VERSION=ON\r\n\r\nwhich fails with error: `Setting SYSTEM_VERSIONING to ON failed because table '[tableName]' has 19 columns and table '[tableName]History' has 18 columns.`\r\n\r\nI double checked that the following order works as intended, but had to modify manually the order of the operation to validate this test:\r\n\r\n- SYSTEM_VERSION=OFF\r\n- DROP COLUMN\r\n- SYSTEM_VERSION=ON\r\n- ADD COLUMN\r\n\r\nAny chance this correct order of operation could be generated when applying such a migration ?\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n### Include provider and version
