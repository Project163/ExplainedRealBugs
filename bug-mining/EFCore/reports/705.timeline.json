The message receive/sending is done inside a TransactionScope (SendsAtomicWithReceive), which is the outer/root TransactionScope in this scenario. Then we use NServiceBus' \"Unit of Work\" with handlers wrapped in a TransactionScope, which becomes the inner/nested scope in this scenario.\nOur issue is that this nested scope has completed and committed to the database, but then the NServiceBus messages are not sent due to the `System.InvalidOperationException: A root ambient transaction was completed before the nested transaction. The nested transactions should be completed first.` error. NServiceBus automatically retries the message correctly, but since the DB transaction was completed, the message is discarded as a duplicate.\nI'm not sure how to work around this, if it is even possible.

day.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2850797150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ThreePinkApples","id":4201981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDE5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4201981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples","html_url":"https://github.com/ThreePinkApples","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThreePinkApples/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19043616726,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAPaMMs6v_y6mzwAAAARvFofW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19043616726","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-07T21:11:36Z","milestone":{"title":"10.0.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19359003169,"node_id":"AE_lADOAPaMMs6v_y6mzwAAAASB4vIh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/19359003169","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-27T01:19:27Z","assignee":{"login":"Copilot","id":198982749,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOC9w8XQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1143301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Copilot","id":198982749,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOC9w8XQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1143301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Copilot","html_url":"https

Customers experience random application failures with no clear workaround other than avoiding distributed transactions.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer reported on EF8.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nYes, from EF Core 3.1. Introduced in dotnet/efcore#20012\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nTest added\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. Changes are focused on improving thread safety of existing ambient transaction functionality. The synchronization is only applied when ambient transactions are used, minimizing performance impact on regular database operations.\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!
