This is because at some point we started to [normalize all Contains calls to Any](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore/Query/Internal/QueryOptimizingExpressionVisitor.cs#L238) in pre-processing.\r\n\r\nAside from the dead code, this forces us to pattern-match in translation in order to recognize Contains, which gets translated to specific patterns; this leads to a weird situation where we normalize out an important distinction, and then have to re-recognize it. This is becoming more problematic with the recent changes to how we deal with Contains. We should do the opposite and make sure that Any is normalized to Contains.\r\n\r\nNote that this is an infrastructure 1st step PR... TranslateContains still delegates to TranslateAny if it can't pattern-match Contains over inline collection, so we end up in a similar place. #30955 will build on top of this to translate to InExpression with subquery, as well as some other planned work.\r\n\r\nNote that this also removes quite a lot of useless parentheses around NOT EXISTS

There can be multiple entries of the customer's transaction in the CustomerMainTableId, so the idea is to select the latest transaction for each customer by grouping and selecting the max id.\r\n\r\nIn entity framework core 3.1, this was achieved via:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar CustomerGroupQuery = _DB.CustomerMainTable.Where(p => _DB.CustomerMainTable\r\n    .GroupBy(l => l.CustomerMainTableCustomerId)\r\n    .Select(g => g.Max(c => c.CustomerMainTableId))\r\n    .Contains(p.CustomerMainTableId));\r\n```\r\nHowever, the same query, when executed in EF Core 6 or 7 produces a wrong query in SQL:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM `CustomerMainTable` AS `t`\r\nWHERE EXISTS (\r\n    SELECT 1\r\n    FROM `CustomerMainTable` AS `t0`\r\n    GROUP BY `t0`.`CustomerMainTableCustomerId`\r\n    HAVING MAX(`t0`.`CustomerMainTableId`) = `t`.`CustomerMainTableId`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, if we split the Linq query like so:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nList<int> idlist = _DB.CustomerMainTable\r\n    .GroupBy(l => l.CustomerMainTableCustomerId)\r\n    .Select(g => g.Max(c => c.CustomerMainTableId)).ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then feed the list of integers back to the contains query:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar CustomerGroupQuery = _DB.CustomerMainTable.Where(p => idlist.Contains(p.CustomerMainTableId));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt produces the correct query. However, feeding the list of integers back to the contains query means this is a client side evaluation which is not ideal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9347114848,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAPaMMs5mj5QPzwAAAAItIadg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/9347114848","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-26T06:55:24Z","rename":{"from":"Actually

IN rather than EXISTS provides some very serious performance advantages, on all databases except for SQL Server; this is probably due to the removal of the correlated subquery which EXISTS requires.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark below uses the data and queries from @FHTSean, comparing the following two SQLs (see #30938):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM `CustomerMainTable` AS `t`\r\nWHERE `t`.`CustomerMainTableId` IN (\r\n    SELECT MAX(`t0`.`CustomerMainTableId`)\r\n    FROM `CustomerMainTable` AS `t0`\r\n    GROUP BY `t0`.`CustomerMainTableCustomerId`\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... with:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM `CustomerMainTable` AS `t`\r\nWHERE EXISTS (\r\n    SELECT 1\r\n    FROM `CustomerMainTable` AS `t0`\r\n    GROUP BY `t0`.`CustomerMainTableCustomerId`\r\n    HAVING MAX(`t0`.`CustomerMainTableId`) = `t`.`CustomerMainTableId`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn MariaDB:\r\n\r\n| Method |         Mean |       Error |      StdDev |\r\n|-------

**seconds**)\r\n\r\nOn PostgreSQL I'm also seeing a very big performance difference, even if less dramatic:\r\n\r\n| Method |       Mean |      Error |     StdDev |\r\n|-------

  Error |    StdDev |\r\n|------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|\r\n|     In | 1.628 ms | 0.0292 ms | 0.0273 ms |\r\n| Exists | 4.962 ms | 0.0980 ms | 0.1274 ms |\r\n\r\nOn SQL Server both queries have the exact same running time, I'm guessing SQL Server sees through the EXISTS and avoids the correlated subquery.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Full benchmark

This improves on [#30955](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30955), which already switched most queries from IN to EXISTS where possible, but not for entity equality/containment.\r\n* It then leverages this and switches to using Contains in ExecuteDelete. This form comes into use for complex querying which cannot be directly translated to DELETE; we then add a WHERE clause that checks whether the row's PK is in a subquery containing the complex conditions.\r\n* Note that ExecuteUpdate generated an inner join instead of IN/EXISTS. This is because unlike with delete, update supports arbitrary projections (e.g. into anonymous types), and that's tricky to get working with IN/EXISTS. The inner join approach should be just as efficient - if a tad uglier - so I'm leaving as-is for now.\r\n \r\nCloses #31386\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10954893395,"node_id":"DEME_lADOAPaMMs5mj5QPzwAAAAKM9mhT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10954893395","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-14T13:49:04Z","milestone":{"title":"8.0.0-preview6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10954893400,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAPaMMs5mj5QPzwAAAAKM9mhY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/10954893400","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-14T13:49:04Z","milestone":{"title":"8.0.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
