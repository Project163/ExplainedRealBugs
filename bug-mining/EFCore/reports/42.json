Description\r\nThis was originally filed in #24112 and got fixed in #24944.\r\n\r\nWe first found out about this issue when inserting a large legal text into our database, which contains a lot of line breaks. EF Core generates a large script which uses `CONCAT()` with up to 254 arguments, before starting a new `CONCAT()`. (\\r and \\n get converted to nchar(10) and nchar(13) and will be concatenated with the rest of the text)\r\n\r\nAs in #24112 described, there is an issue with `CONCAT` if you don't CAST the first parameter as `nvarchar(max)` the sql server will assume the 4000 byte limit.\r\n\r\nThis was fixed with #24944 by adding a `CAST` to the first parameter of `CONCAT`. However, subsequent `CONCAT`s will not use a `CAST`. This will lead to silently truncated strings in the database.\r\n\r\nI already had a look at the code and decided to fix it and contribute to this project. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/652333575b6a7147e2652627365c591a4f303234/src/EFCore.SqlServer/Storage/Internal/SqlServerStringTypeMapping.cs#L312-L317\r\n\r\nIt seems that resetting the `castApplied` flag to false inside the if fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nAs per the the contribution guidelines, I am requesting permission to file a PR.\r\n\r\n### Include provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: latest (main branch)\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework: .NET 6.0\r\nOperating system: Windows 10\r\nIDE: (e.g. Visual Studio 2019 16.3)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"smitpatel","id":1528107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjgxMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel","html_url":"https://github.com/smitpatel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27206/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
