In my case we have several places where we sort the collection after it has been returned from the database.\r\n\r\n`class.Students = class.Students.OrderBy(s => s.Property).ToList();`\r\n\r\nObviously a trivial example.  The collection of class.Students could have been originally retrieved from the database with or without a sort.  It could have been added to after the original query, etc.  However we need the final collection sorted in place.  Of course there are work arounds like clearing the original collection and adding to it a sorted one, using .Sort(), or customizing the T4 templates. However I'm trying to understand whether our usage goes against best practices?  What is the proper/recommended way of solving this?  There must be a reason why child properties are now read only.  This was not clear from both closed items referenced above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ErikEJ/EFCorePowerTools/issues/1598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ErikEJ/EFCorePowerTools/issues/1598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8540434656,"node_id":"AE_lADOAPaMMs5ec4rfzwAAAAH9DLDg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8540434656","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-16T19:21:22Z","assignee":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8540437389,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5ec4rfzwAAAAH9DLuN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8540437389","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-16T19:21:45Z","label":{"name":"area-scaffolding","color":"32b37b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8540438020,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5ec4rfzwAAAAH9DL4E","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/8540438020","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":nul

The setter is not needed for EF use cases, so this made the generated code cleaner. However, it turns out that:\r\n\r\n- Like to use the setter to set an entirely new collection, even though it isn't really designed to be used that way\r\n- Some serializers, notably System.Text.Json, ignore properties without setters, even though the property is pre-initialized and so is never null or needs setting.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\n\r\nMultiple customers prefer the previously generated code, and, more importantly, System.Text.Json no longer serializes entities correctly. There is a workaround--customize the T4 template to add the setter.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\n\r\nMultiple customer reports on 7.0.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\n\r\nMaybe, if you squint. This isn't a runtime code change; it requires the user to generate new code. However, the code generated is different than it used to be.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nTests updated.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow. No quirk, because this is tooling code.
