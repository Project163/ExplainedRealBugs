Bug description\n\nI found that starting with EF Core 10.0, it no longer depends on the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Analyzers` package. This change triggers the following compiler warning:\n\"Non-nullable property 'Test' must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider declaring the property as nullable or adding the 'required' modifier.\"\n\nAfter reviewing the commit history, I confirmed this behavior was introduced by #34596. Could you clarify whether this is intentional, or is it an unintended regression?\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\n\n```\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Verbose output\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### EF Core version\n\n10.0.0-preview.6.25358.103\n\n### Database provider\n\n_No response_\n\n### Target framework\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### IDE\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
