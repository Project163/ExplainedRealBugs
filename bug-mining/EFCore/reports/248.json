querying against values coming out of a JSON document, we need to make sure that the JSON values get projected out as the correct store type, otherwise comparison with e.g. a regular column will fail. For SQL Server, most store types work by simply casting the string representation returned from OPENJSON; but with SQLite - which has very few types - there are some issues:\r\n\r\n.NET type      | Store representation      | Default JSON representation | Notes\r\n-------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | -----\r\nDateTime       | 2023-01-01 12:30:00       | 2023-01-01T12:30:00         | Can be converted via datetime()\r\nDateTimeOffset | 2023-01-01 12:30:00+02:00 | 2023-01-01T12:30:00+02:00   | datetime() yields 2023-01-01 10:30:00\r\ndecimal        | \"1.0\" (string)            | 1 (number)                     |\r\nGuid           | uppercase                 | lowercase                   | can use upper(), or store uppercase in JSON \r\nbyte[]         | X'0102'                   | AQI= (base64)               | Same problem in SQL Server, though OPENJSON/WITH does decode base64\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\n1. Convert the JSON representation to the store type upon extraction; this is ideal, when supported. A CAST usually works for SQL Server, and in some cases a custom function is needed (e.g. datetime for SQLite). Adding the conversion function to the type mapping is part of #30677.\r\n2. Store the database's literal representation in JSON. In cases where there's a semi-standard JSON representation, this isn't great; for example, timestamps are commonly represented as ISO8601 in JSON, and storing another representation wouldn't be good for interoperability. The API for this would also be part of #30677.\r\n3. Leave the type as unqueryable - that is, storable via value converter only.\r\n\r\nFor option 1, we need type mapping API support which tells us how to convert values coming out of a JSON document into their equivalent relational store representation. Note that this is complicated somewhat in SQL Server, where in most cases we can simply use OPENJSON/WITH which automatically does the conversion for us, but in some cases we can't do that (because OPENJSON/WITH doesn't preserve ordering, and is also incompatible with geometry).","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30727/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
