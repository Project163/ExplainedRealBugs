set; }\r\n    \r\n    public int Age { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Table(nameof(Developer))]\r\npublic class Developer : Human\r\n{\r\n    public string MainLanguage { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe database context for this model is the following\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic class FooContext : DbContext\r\n{\r\n    public DbSet<Developer> Developers { get; set; } = null!;\r\n\r\n    /// <inheritdoc />\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);\r\n\r\n        // This is made to get TPT\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Human>().ToTable(nameof(Human));\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Developer>().ToTable(nameof(Developer));\r\n        \r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Human>().ToTable(nameof(Human), t => t.ExcludeFromMigrations());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// <inheritdoc />\r\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        base.OnConfiguring(optionsBuilder);\r\n\r\n        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(\"<FooBarConnectionString>\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see I only want `Developer` to be in the migration. `Human` should be excluded. Why would I want to do this? I am extending an existing model and the base (`Human`) already exists in the database. I want to add `Developer` to this existing model.\r\n\r\nBut if I create a migration the whole hierarchy of `Human` is excluded (basically all classes of type `Human`). But I want the `Developer` to be created.\r\n\r\nOf course, I could just remove the line\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Human>().ToTable(nameof(Human), t => t.ExcludeFromMigrations());\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then manually remove the added `Human` from the migration. But is there a way to do this automatically?","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30079/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
