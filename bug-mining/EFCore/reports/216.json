to #25163 (map primitive collections to another table).\r\nContrast also to #28688, which is about allowing primitive collections *inside* JSON documents.\r\nContrast as well to #28871, which is about allowing any unmapped value in a JSON document, not just primitives\r\n\r\nThis type of mapping doesn't involve a new table in the database but could still allow queries using the JSON query functionality of the relational database.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The JSON support here would be for JSON stored in a simple property, not aggregates mapped via owned types.\r\n- Also consider other issues related to primitive collections--see label `area-primitive-collections`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29427/reactions","total_count":22,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
