properties of type 'DateIndex'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is how `DateIndex` type is defined:\r\n```CSharp\r\npublic readonly record struct DateIndex : IComparable<DateIndex>, ISpanParsable<DateIndex>\r\n{\r\n    public readonly int Value;\r\n\r\n    public DateIndex(int value)\r\n    {\r\n        Value = value;\r\n    }\r\n    ....\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd its conversion is defined in `OnCOnfigureConventions` method:\r\n```CSharp\r\nconfigurationBuilder.Properties<DateIndex>(b =>\r\n{\r\n    b.HaveConversion<DateIndexToIntConverter>();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy expectation is that EF should  use the same value converter.\r\nHere's what docs say:\r\n> [FromSql](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.relationalqueryableextensions.fromsql) can be used with any scalar type supported by your database provider. If you'd like to use a type not supported by your database provider, you can use [pre-convention configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/bulk-configuration#pre-convention-configuration) to define a value conversion for it.\r\n\r\nIf this is by design and is not the case for `ExecuteSql` method, then it should be explicitly mentioned in xmldoc.  \r\n\r\nHere's is [a repo](https://github.com/voroninp/ValueConverterIsNotUsedInExecuteSql)\r\n\r\nEF Core version:\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite)\r\nTarget framework:  .NET 7.0\r\nOperating system: Windows 11\r\nIDE: Visual Studio 2022 17.8\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
