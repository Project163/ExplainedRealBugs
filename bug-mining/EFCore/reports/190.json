Description\r\n\r\nWhen EntityFrameworkCore generates SQL query it misses important brackets, when I use Expression.Lambda.\r\nIn my example it can cause situation, when all additional _.Where()_ statements are being ignored.\r\n\r\n## Code \r\n\r\n```C#\r\nExpression<Func<TestEntity, bool>> expression1 = x => x.Name == \"name\" && x.Value == \"value1\";\r\nExpression<Func<TestEntity, bool>> expression2 = x => x.Name == \"name\" && x.Value == \"value2\";\r\nvar param = Expression.Parameter(typeof(TestEntity), \"x\");\r\nvar body = Expression.Or(\r\n        Expression.Invoke(expression1, param),\r\n        Expression.Invoke(expression2, param)\r\n    );\r\nvar logicSum = Expression.Lambda<Func<TestEntity, bool>>(body, param);\r\n\r\nvar res = context.TestEntities.Where(logicSum).Where(x => x.Id == 2).FirstOrDefault();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Generated SQL\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT t.\"Id\", t.\"Name\", t.\"Value\"\r\nFROM \"TestEntities\" AS t\r\nWHERE (t.\"Name\" = 'name' AND t.\"Value\" = 'value1') OR (t.\"Name\" = 'name' AND t.\"Value\" = 'value2') AND t.\"Id\" = 2\r\nLIMIT 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue with the SQL\r\n\r\nAs You can see, it's missing brackets, and now, when first of the two predicates is true, it will skip our second _.Where_ clause at all.\r\n\r\n## Code description\r\n\r\nOf course in this case use of this syntax is unnecessary, but it is just simplified example to illustrate the problem. My original issue was caused in code, when I needed to generate predicate based on list of pairs of values. That's the only way to create logic sum for generic Expression<Func<>> I could find. If there is a simpler way, I'm happy to hear it out(although it doesn't change the fact, that here's a bug).\r\n\r\n## On the contrary\r\n\r\nIf Expression.Lambda construction is not used, and describe predicates explicitly, this issue doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar res2 = context.TestEntities.Where(x => (x.Name == \"name\" && x.Value == \"value1\") || (x.Name == \"name\" && x.Value == \"value2\")).Where(x => x.Id == 2).FirstOrDefault();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Generated SQL\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT t.\"Id\", t.\"Name\", t.\"Value\"\r\nFROM \"TestEntities\" AS t\r\nWHERE ((t.\"Name\" = 'name' AND t.\"Value\" = 'value1') OR (t.\"Name\" = 'name' AND t.\"Value\" = 'value2')) AND t.\"Id\" = 2\r\nLIMIT 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThat's exactly how the original SQL should look like, when using Expression.Lambda.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 7.0.2\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL\r\nTarget framework: .NET 6.0\r\nOperating system: Windows 10\r\nIDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2022 Version 17.2.5\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
