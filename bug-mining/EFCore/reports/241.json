This means that if the one explicit configuration is removed for some reason, all others become broken in various ways.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can add an API to pre-convention model configuration to configure a CLR type as complex, and otherwise require that users explicitly configure.\r\n\r\nNote the interaction with #31275, which is about automatically configuring *nested* complex types as complex. Implementing the behavior above removes the problematic part raised in https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31275#issuecomment-1642938765.","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
