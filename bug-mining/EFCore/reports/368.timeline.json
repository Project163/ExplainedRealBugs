string property accepts Unicode and whether it has a fixed length.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nWhen using a compiled model with unicode properties queries involving those properties will use non-unicode behavior, potentially resulting in data corruption.\r\n\r\n### How found\r\n\r\nCustomer report on 8.0.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTests added.\r\n\r\n###

Features\n\n## ASP.NET Core\n\n- Added `IEndpointInspector` (#​1066)\n   - Enables controller action endpoints to not be processed by _Minimal API_ endpoint collators\n   - `EndpointApiVersionMetadataCollationProvider` has a new constructor that accepts `IEndpointInspector`\n      - The previous constructor is now `Obsolete` and will be removed in a `9.0`\n- Added `AddErrorObjects` make integration with the legacy **Error Objects** format easier (related to #​1072)\n  - The underlying `JsonOptions` configuration will remain implicit as it is today, but `9.0` will remove it\n     - It is recommended you use one of the `AddErrorObjects` extension methods versus mapping `IProblemDetailsWriter` explicitly\n  - The associated `JsonSerializerContext` is now accessible, if needed\n  - `AddErrorObjects<TWriter>` allows configuring an extended/customized `ErrorObjectWriter` type\n- Added `IApiVersionDescriptionProviderFactory.Create()` extension method\n   - Replacing `IApiVersionDescriptionProviderFactory` in DI also now replaces `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider`\n   - `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider` can still be individually replaced if you really

For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4.

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure.
