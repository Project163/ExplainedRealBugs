updating a \"normal\" (non-string) property, we produce the following sql:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n@p0='[true]' (Nullable = false) (Size = 6)\r\n@p1='[false]' (Nullable = false) (Size = 7)\r\n@p2='1'\r\n\r\nSET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF;\r\nSET NOCOUNT ON;\r\nUPDATE [JsonEntitiesAllTypes] SET [Collection] = JSON_MODIFY([Collection], 'strict $[0].TestBoolean', CAST(JSON_VALUE(@p0,

is string on client side but (say) bool on the server we issue the following:\r\n```sql\r\n@p0='[false]' (Nullable = false) (Size = 7)\r\n@p1='1'\r\n\r\nSET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF;\r\nSET NOCOUNT ON;\r\nUPDATE [JsonEntitiesConverters] SET [Reference] = JSON_MODIFY([Reference], ''strict $.StringTrueFalseConvertedToBool'', JSON_VALUE(@p0, ''$[0]''))\r\nOUTPUT 1\r\nWHERE [Id] = @p1;\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. we don't wrap the value in cast to a provider type, which then results in us storing it as string and causes problems when querying the values. We should look if the property has a converter and check provider type when determining if we need CAST or not.","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
