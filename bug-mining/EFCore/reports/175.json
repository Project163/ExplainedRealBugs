7.0 changed the default update SQL to use the SQL RETURNING/OUTPUT for fetching back database-generated columns. Some cases where identified where this does not work, and so the following opt-out strategies were done:\r\n\r\n* On SQL Server, the OUTPUT clause is incompatible with [triggers](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/27531) and [certain computed columns](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/issues/4130). We added the possibility to model a trigger, and made this opt out of the OUTPUT clause.\r\n* On SQLite, old versions didn't yet support the RETURNING clause. We added logic to detect the SQLite version being used and automatically not use RETURNING.\r\n\r\nHowever, various other incompatibility scenarios were gradually discovered - [virtual tables](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/issues/29512) and [certain triggers types](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/issues/29811) on SQLite. It's also not a good solution on SQL Server to tell users to configure a fake trigger if they have a problematic computed column.\r\n\r\nAs a result, in 8.0 we're adding UseSqlOutputClause for SQL Server and UseSqlReturningClause for SQLite, which are targeted, explicit opt-outs specifically for disabling these clauses. A user convention can be used to apply this to all entity types.","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29916/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29916/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
