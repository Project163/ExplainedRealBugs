File a bug\r\n\r\nI tried making a simple nested type project to debug the problem I have in the following issue https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31726 where I'm unable to create a migration for a nested type.\r\n\r\nI was finally able to create a migration by using the fluent api instead of only relying on attributes.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that using the following code correctly create a migration, but then the Model Snapshot won't compile.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n {\r\n     modelBuilder\r\n

snapshot, I added comments where there is an error.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n        protected override void BuildModel(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n#pragma warning disable 612, 618\r\n
