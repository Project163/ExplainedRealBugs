File a bug\r\n\r\nPlease see #29219 for context. This issue is precisely described in the comment https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29219#issuecomment-1356886149 that was added and is related to #29219.\r\n\r\nWhen a new nullable property is added to a model mapped as json, then querying on that should not error, but instead missing json values in the data should just map to null. According to #29219 looks like this was fixed for simple types (string, int, ..) but still does not work for complex types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Include provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 7.0.0\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework: .NET 7.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30028/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30028/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
