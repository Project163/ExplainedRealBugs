order.State == OrderState.Paid })\n    // The following is OK (non-value-converted string)\n    // .Select(order => new { IsNameFoo = order.Name == \"Foo\" })\n    .ToListAsync();\n```\n\n9.0

there a workaround or a setting that will change this default behavior? All of the enums that we use are stored as strings in the DB for readability. Any query we run in the application that filters by/compares equality of an enum now fails with .Net 9.\n\nFor example, the query below now fails (edited for brevity):\n\n```\nPlantsData = await _dbContext\n    .PlantItem\n    .AsNoTracking()\n    .Select(x => new PlantsData\n    {\n        PlantItemId = x.Id,\n        IsProduced = x.InventoryTrackingMethod == InventoryTrackingMethod.ProducedItem, // Fails\n        IsProduced2 = x.InventoryTrackingMethod.Equals(InventoryTrackingMethod.ProducedItem), // This doesn't work either\n        InventoryTrackingMethod = x.InventoryTrackingMethod\n    })\n    .Where(x => x.ItemId == itemId)\n    .ToArrayAsync();\n```\n\nTo bypass the error, I have to modify the query like so (adding .ToString() to each enum):\n\n```\nPlantsData = await _dbContext\n    .PlantItem\n    .AsNoTracking()\n    .Select(x => new PlantsData\n    {\n        PlantItemId = x.Id,\n        IsProduced = x.InventoryTrackingMethod.ToString() == InventoryTrackingMethod.ProducedItem.ToString(),\n        InventoryTrackingMethod = x.InventoryTrackingMethod\n    })\n    .Where(x => x.ItemId == itemId)\n    .ToArrayAsync();\n```\n\nIf there is no workaround, I'll be required to modify hundreds of queries that compare enums, and since the compiler provides no warning of this issue, if I miss a query among the hundreds, my users will get runtime errors.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2485479474/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JamesHill3","id":1727474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjc0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesHill3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesHill3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15442562866,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs6eRMiezwAAAAOYcs8y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15442562866","actor":{"login":"kresimirlesic","id":34268109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY4MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34268109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic","html_url":"https://github.com/kresimirlesic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kresimirlesic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-26T21:52:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15461229839,"node_id":"AE_lADOAPaMMs6eRMiezwAAAAOZj6UP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15461229839","actor":{"login":"cincuranet","id":4540597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDA1OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4540597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet","html_url":"https://github.com/cincuranet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cincuranet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-28T07:21:54Z","assignee":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15469217108,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs6eRMiezwAAAAOaCYVU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15469217108","actor":{"login":"ranma42","id":1506030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDYwMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1506030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ranma42","html_url":"htt
