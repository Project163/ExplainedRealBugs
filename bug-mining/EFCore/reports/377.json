this model:\r\n```cs\r\npublic class User\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n    public required FullName FullName { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Owned]\r\npublic class FullName\r\n{\r\n    public required FirstName { get; set; }\r\n    public required LastName { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInserting a `User` with by assigning a `FullName` object to the `FullName` property works:\r\n```cs\r\ndb.Add(new User\r\n{\r\n    FullName = someFullNameObj,\r\n});\r\ndb.SaveChanges();\r\n```\r\nBut doing the same with `ExecuteUpdate` doesn't work:\r\n```cs\r\ndb.Users.Where(u => u.Id == userId)\r\n    .ExecuteUpdate(b => b\r\n        .SetProperty(u => u.FullName, someFullNameObj)\r\n    );\r\n```\r\nIt throws an exception along these lines:\r\n>The LINQ expression ... could not be translated. The following lambda argument to 'SetProperty' does not represent a valid property to be set: 'u => u.FullName'.\r\n\r\nThis is an unexpected asymmetry between how insert and update work, I think most people would intuitively expect the `ExecuteUpdate` example to work just fine, it's a bit surprising, a weird limitation.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's an existing issue for this.","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32058/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32058/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
