that OPENJSON will return 50 rows. If the column that you're filtering on is not very selective, that is enough to dissuade SQL Server from seeking that index. In addition, it also dissuades it from using filtered indexes which requires constants but that's orthogonal. I have a lot of queries where i do `.Where(x => col.Contains(x.SomeId))` where `col` contains in 99% of the time just one element, with the very rare 0 or occasional 2 elements (although more are possible in theory).\r\n\r\nSince that is absolutely blocking, i had to apply the CompatLevel 120 hack but i consider that quite the nuclear option, especially since we would like to use more of the `ToJson` features. The only other option i could see to get around that was to apply a `FORCESEEK` hint but this isn't (well) supported in EFC either.\r\n\r\nCompatLevel 120 works for now but i don't think that's a permanent solution. Query Cache poisoning and frequent recompilations are not remotely as expensive as queries that regress from milliseconds to \"can't finish in 120s\", so this feature comes at a trade off that is not worth it for us. The naive better solution to workaround this would be similiar to the SplitQuery feature (that has both a global and query level switch). \r\n\r\n### Include provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF

This changes the SQL to contain an uncorrelated IN subquery instead.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nThe correlated subquery can be the cause of very serious perf regressions; for example, one user reported that a [query](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32394#issuecomment-1843578244) that previously completed in milliseconds now times out.\r\n\r\n### How found\r\n\r\nCustomer reported on 8.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nYes, considerable perf regression from 7.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThe new SQL is asserted in tests.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nMedium, the change has been

However, EXISTS allows customizing the predicate. For example, consider translating LINQ `something.Contains(x)` to SQL IN; the natural translation would be with IN: `x IN (subquery)`, and this is what EF indeed does in the regular case. However, if `x` is nullable and `subquery` may return nullable elements, then there's no way to distinguish between the case where `x` was not found in the subquery results (NULL is returned), and the case where `x` was NULL and the subquery also returned NULL (NULL is also returned). This is an issue when trying to replicate the C# 2-value logic behavior via 3-value SQL (LINQ `something.Contains(x)` is expected to return true when `x` is null and `something` contains null as well).\r\n\r\nThe way EF handles this at the moment, is to use EXISTS instead, and compensate for 3-value logic in the predicate; so instead of `WHERE x IN (SELECT i FROM t)`, we generate `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT i FROM t WHERE i = x OR (i IS NULL AND x IS NULL)`. However, that's a more complex query, and is crucially also correlated (the reference to x which comes from the outside), and is the source of some severe performance issues.\r\n\r\nThe fix in #32575 if for EF to do parameter preprocessing, for the case where `subquery` represents a simple parameterized list, remove the NULL out of it, adding additional clauses to compensate; so if we detect that the list contains null, we remove it and generate: `WHERE x IN (subquery) OR x IS NULL`; this allows us to continue using the tighter and uncorrelated IN construct, while preserving the desired 2-value behavior.\r\n\r\nNegation indeed introduces some further complications; you're welcome to take a look at #32575 which does this work, and I'm otherwise happy to continue exchanging around
