Bug description\n\nI'm using ExecuteUpdateAsync with a Tag. When updating a value to be null depending on how the null value is passed to SetProperty the resulting SQL does not contain the tag values as comments.\n\nFor example, if I pass null in an expression then the tags appear in the SQL:\n\n```\nawait context\n    .TestTable1\n    .TagWith(\"Update with null expression\")\n    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(s => s.SetProperty(t => t.Value, t => (string?)null));\n```\nSQL produced:\n```\n-- Update with null expression\n\nUPDATE \"TestTable1\" AS \"t\"\nSET \"Value\" = NULL\n```\n\nHowever, if I pass null as a constant then the tags are not in the SQL:\n```\nawait context\n    .TestTable1\n    .TagWith(\"Update with null constant\")\n    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(s => s.SetProperty<string?>(t => t.Value, (string?)null));\n```\nSQL produced:\n```\nUPDATE \"TestTable1\" AS \"t\"\nSET \"Value\" = NULL\n```\n\nAttached is a small project that demonstrates the issue by using an interceptor to capture the text of the update statement.\n\n[EfCoreTagBug.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22678840/EfCoreTagBug.zip)\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\nawait context\n    .TestTable1\n    .TagWith(\"Update with null constant\")\n    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(s => s.SetProperty<string?>(t => t.Value, (string?)null));\n```\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Verbose output\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### EF Core version\n\n10.0.0-RC.1.25451.107\n\n### Database provider\n\nMicrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite\n\n### Target framework\n\nNet 10.0\n\n### Operating system\n\nWIndows 11\n\n### IDE\n\nVisual Studio 2026 18.0.0 [11018.127]","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
