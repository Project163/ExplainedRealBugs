EFCore, the implementation of `SqlConstantExpression` does not respect the requirements of `Equals`/`GetHashCode` since https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/commit/ff99dc3fb57b84440ceeddd256d6131696d8b43f, specifically\n\n> If two objects compare as equal, the [GetHashCode()](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode?view=net-9.0#system-object-gethashcode) method for each object must return the same value.\n\n(from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode)\n\n```csharp\n// @nuget: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational -Version 3.0.0\nusing System;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Linq.Expressions;\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.SqlExpressions;\n\nint[] x = [1, 2, 3];\n\nvar a = new SqlConstantExpression(Expression.Constant(x.ToList()), null);\nvar b = new SqlConstantExpression(Expression.Constant(x.ToList()), null);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(a.GetHashCode());\nConsole.WriteLine(b.GetHashCode());\nConsole.WriteLine(a.GetHashCode() == b.GetHashCode());\nConsole.WriteLine(a.Equals(b));\n```\n\nThis snippet emits\n```\n-765869390\n-1092809484\nFalse\nFalse\n```\non EFCore 3.0.0 and\n```\n-1656061180\n971732864\nFalse\nTrue\n```\non EFCore 3.1, 6, 8.\n\nNote that because of https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/35355 the snippet is meaningless on EFCore 9.\nThe corresponding one is \n```csharp\n// @nuget: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational -Version 9.0.0\nusing System;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.SqlExpressions;\n\nint[] x = [1, 2, 3];\n\nvar a = new SqlConstantExpression(x.ToList(), null);\nvar b = new SqlConstantExpression(x.ToList(), null);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(a.GetHashCode());\nConsole.WriteLine(b.GetHashCode());\nConsole.WriteLine(a.GetHashCode() == b.GetHashCode());\nConsole.WriteLine(a.Equals(b));\n```\nwhich emits\n```\n-3729430\n1003242459\nFalse\nTrue\n```\n\nThis inconsistency is caused by the \"deep\" check for `IList` in `SqlConstantExpression.ValueEquals`.\nAssuming that is intentional and needed, a corresponding hash construction should probably also be performed.","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35372/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
