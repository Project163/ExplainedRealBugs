Or about the EF approach to testing NativeAOT/trimming? At the moment there's almost nothing in place (except for an extremely minimal trimming console app which provides only very basic coverage).\r\n\r\nThe exact scope of EF compatibility with NativeAOT/trimming (and therefore, what is covered by testing) will probably become apparent as the work progresses. In an ideal world, we'd be able to use the existing EF test suite, and simply run it with NativeAOT publishing; that would leverage the extremely comprehensive test coverage which EF already has, rather than starting from scratch. Unfortunately, there are likely to be various hurdles there, with xUnit NativeAOT compatibility possibly being one. \r\n\r\nSo I'm not quite sure how to answer your questions.. I'm hard at work at the moment on #25009 - precompiled queries - which are pretty much a prerequisite to NativeAOT support. Testing is something I intend to think about later in the
