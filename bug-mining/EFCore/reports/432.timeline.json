Turns out standard SQL Server now works on Mac with Appel Silicon, but the problem is exactly the same.\r\n\r\nI've configured a .NET API and ~Azure SQL Edge~ SQL Server using Aspire, and the connection specifically fails when initiated from an Aspire Host. Here is the exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the pre-login handshake. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - 20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt took me forever to isolate, but it turns out that this only happens when the API is started by the Aspire Host. I've created a Git repository that showcases the problem here: https://github.com/tjementum/AspireWithSqlServer, with even more info in the README.\r\n\r\nIf the same connection is initiated by starting the .NET API directly, everything works correctly. In fact, if I start everything using Aspire and let it fail, and then manually start the API it works. **The repository has a Gif that shows the problem.**\r\n\r\nHere is a summary. \r\n\r\nAppHost.Program.cs:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Projects;\r\n\r\nvar builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\r\n\r\nvar sqlPassword = \"YourSecretPassword01!\"; \r\n\r\nvar sqlServer = builder.AddSqlServerContainer(\"localhost\", sqlPassword, 1433)\r\n    .WithAnnotation(\r\n        new ContainerImageAnnotation { Registry = \"mcr.microsoft.com\", Image = \"azure-sql-edge\", Tag = \"latest\" }\r\n    );\r\n\r\nbuilder.AddProject<AspireWithSqlServer_WebApi>(\"WebApi\")\r\n    .WithEnvironment(\"SQL_PASSWORD\", sqlPassword)\r\n    .WithEnvironment(\"SQL_SERVER\", sqlServer.Resource.Name);\r\n\r\nbuilder.Build().Run();\r\n```\r\nUpdate: Turns out standard SQL Server now works on Mac with Appel Silicon, but the problem is exactly the same. I've updated this issue.\r\n\r\nIn the API, I connect to the database using Entity Framework with this connection string:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic static string GetConnectionString(this IConfiguration configuration)\r\n{\r\n    var connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString(\"Default\");\r\n    var sqlServer = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"SQL_SERVER\") ?? \"localhost\";\r\n    var sqlPassword = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"SQL_PASSWORD\") ?? \"YourSecretPassword01!\";\r\n    return connectionString!\r\n        .Replace(\"${SQL_SERVER}\", sqlServer)\r\n        .Replace(\"${SQL_PASSWORD}\", sqlPassword);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nappsettings.json:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"ConnectionStrings\": {\r\n    \"Default\": \"Server=${SQL_SERVER};Database=weather;User Id=sa;Password=${SQL_PASSWORD};Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=True\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm running this on a MacBook M1 with an ARM processor ~, which necessitates the use of Azure SQL Edge, as the standard SQL Server is not supported on ARM

Features\n\n## ASP.NET Core\n\n- Added `IEndpointInspector` (#​1066)\n   - Enables controller action endpoints to not be processed by _Minimal API_ endpoint collators\n   - `EndpointApiVersionMetadataCollationProvider` has a new constructor that accepts `IEndpointInspector`\n      - The previous constructor is now `Obsolete` and will be removed in a `9.0`\n- Added `AddErrorObjects` make integration with the legacy **Error Objects** format easier (related to #​1072)\n  - The underlying `JsonOptions` configuration will remain implicit as it is today, but `9.0` will remove it\n     - It is recommended you use one of the `AddErrorObjects` extension methods versus mapping `IProblemDetailsWriter` explicitly\n  - The associated `JsonSerializerContext` is now accessible, if needed\n  - `AddErrorObjects<TWriter>` allows configuring an extended/customized `ErrorObjectWriter` type\n- Added `IApiVersionDescriptionProviderFactory.Create()` extension method\n

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4.

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 2, many contributed by our community.

One of these might be just the thing you have been waiting for, so read on!\n\n- [Discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues)\n- [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew) documentation.\n- [Documentation & Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs)\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Prune columns passed to OPENJSON's WITH clause\n  - EF9 removes unnecessary columns when calling `OPENJSON WITH`.\n  - See [_Prune columns from JSON_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Translations involving GREATEST/LEAST\n  - Several new translations have been introduced that use the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions.\n  - This includes translations of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` in non-aggregate queries, as well as directly exposing the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions in relational providers.\n  - See [_GREATEST/LEAST translations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Force or prevent query parameterization\n  - Except in some special cases, EF Core parameterizes variables used in a LINQ query, but includes constants in the generated SQL. EF9 allows constants to be translated to parameters and variables to be translated to constants on a case to case basis.\n  - See [_Force or prevent query parameterization_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#force-or-prevent-query-parameterization) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## ExecuteUpdate\n\n- Allow passing complex type instances to ExecuteUpdate\n  - EF9 supports directly passing complex type instances to `ExecuteUpdate` as sugar for updating all member values.\n  - See [_ExecuteUpdate for complex types_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#allow-passing-complex-type-instances-to-executeupdate) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Temporal tables\n\n- Small migrations for temporal tables\n  - The migration created when changing an existing table into a temporal table has been reduced in size for EF9.\n  - See [_Improved temporal table migrations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#improved-temporal-table-migrations) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Model building\n\n- Make existing model building conventions more extensible\n  - In EF9, we have made it easier to extend some of the existing conventions, such as those for property and key discovery.\n  - See [_Extensible model building conventions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#make-existing-model-building-conventions-more-extensible) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors\n  - In EF9, we have both improved the error messages generated when this fails, and also enabled instantiation by non-public constructor.\n  - See [_ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#update-applyconfigurationsfromassembly-to-call-non-public-constructors) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Everything else in Preview 1\n\n Preview 1 contains:\n \n- [30 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [51 bug fixes in EF9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n   - [8 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.1+is%3Aclosed)\n   - [25 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.2](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed+)\n ... (truncated)\n\n## 8.0.17\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\n- **Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade** ([#​36085](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36085))  \n  Updates the project's dependencies using the latest versions from the dotnet/arcade repository. This ensures that the build infrastructure and related tooling are up to date, which can bring in important bug fixes, security patches, and improvements from upstream.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **Update branding to 8.0.17** ([#​36043](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36043))  \n  Updates the internal version branding to 8.0.17. This change ensures that the product and its packages correctly reflect the new release version, helping users and developers identify the build.\n\n- **Merging internal commits for release/8.0** ([#​36080](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36080))  \n  Integrates various internal commits into the release/8.0 branch. This merge brings together important updates and ensures the release branch is synchronized with recent internal development, maintaining consistency and stability for the release.\n\n---\n\nThis summary is generated and may contain inaccuracies.

`AddErrorObjects` make integration with the legacy **Error Objects** format easier (related to #​1072)\n  - The underlying `JsonOptions` configuration will remain implicit as it is today, but `9.0`

For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4.

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure.

For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4.

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes.

2.0.0.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n\n_Sourced from [Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker's releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-dotnet-worker/releases)._\n\n## 2.0.0\n\n### Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker (metapackage) 2.0.0\n\n- Updating `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core` to 2.0.0\n- Updating `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Grpc` to 2.0.0\n- Changed exception handling in function invocation path to ensure fatal exceptions bubble up.\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n- Dropping .NET 5 TFM support\n- Capability `IncludeEmptyEntriesInMessagePayload` is now enabled by default (#​2701)\n  - This means that empty entries will be included in the function trigger message payload by default.\n  - To disable this capability and return to the old behaviour, set `IncludeEmptyEntriesInMessagePayload` to `false` in the worker options.\n- `ValidateScopes` is enabled for development environments by default.\n\n### Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core 2.0.0\n\n- Updating `Azure.Core` to 1.41.0\n- New APIs supporting `IHostApplicationBuilder`\n- Updated service registrations for bootstrapping methods to ensure idempotency.\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\n- Capability `EnableUserCodeException` is now enabled by default (#​2702)\n  - This means that exceptions thrown by user code will be surfaced to the Host as their original exception type, instead of being wrapped in an RpcException.\n  - To disable this capability and return to the old behaviour, set `EnableUserCodeException` to `false` in the worker options.\n  - The `EnableUserCodeException` property in WorkerOptions has been marked as obsolete and may be removed in a future release.\n- Rename `ILoggerExtensions` to `FunctionsLoggerExtensions` to avoid naming conflict issues (#​2716)\n- Removed the default value for HttpStatusCode in WriteAsJsonAsync (#​2720)\n- Removed fallback command line argument reading code for grpc worker startup options. (#​1908)\n\n##### Setting Worker Options Example\n\nIf you need to disable these capabilities and return to the old behaviour, you can set the worker options as follows:\n\n```csharp\nvar host = new HostBuilder()\n.ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults(options =>\n{\n    options.EnableUserCodeException = false;\n    options.IncludeEmptyEntriesInMessagePayload = false;\n})\n```\n\n### Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Grpc 2.0.0\n\n- Refer to metapackage\n\n\n## 1.24.0\n\n## What's Changed\n\n### Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker (metapackage) 1.24.0\n\n- Updating `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core` to 1.20.0\n- Updating `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Grpc` to 1.18.0\n\n### Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Core 1.20.0\n\n- Updated service registrations for bootstrapping methods to ensure idempotency.

(truncated)\n\n## 9.0.0-rc.2.24474.1\n\n[Release](https://github.com/dotnet/core/releases/tag/v9.0.0-rc.2)\n\n## 9.0.0-rc.1.24451.1\n\n[Release](https://github.com/dotnet/core/releases/tag/v9.0.0-rc.1)\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.7.24405.3\n\n[Release](https://github.com/dotnet/core/releases/tag/v9.0.0-preview.7)\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.6.24327.4\n\n[Release](https://github.com/dotnet/core/releases/tag/v9.0.0-preview.6)\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.5.24306.3\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 5. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 3 are:\n\n- @​lauxjpn: [Cleanup duplicate tests (same test ID)](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33185)\n- @​clement911: [Fixed typo in getting-and-building-the-code.md](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33166)\n- @​Rezakazemi890: [32943-Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33062)\n- @​lauxjpn: [Change Where_math(f)_log_new_base queries, so they fail if LOG() parameters are swapped](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33342)\n- @​SteSinger: [33196 command timeout allow zero](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33198)\n\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.2.24128.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 2. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 2, many contributed by our community. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Inlined uncorrelated subqueries\n  - In EF8, an IQueryable referenced in another query may be executed as a separate database roundtrip.\n  - See [Inlined uncorrelated subqueries](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#inlinedsubs) for full details.\n- New ToHashSetAsync methods\n  - The `ToHashSet` methods have existed since .NET Core 2.0. In EF9, the equivalent async methods have been added.\n  - See [New `ToHashSetAsync<T>` methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hashsetasync) for full details.\n\n## Improved model building\n\n- Specify caching for sequences\n  - EF9 allows setting the caching options for database sequences for any relational database provider that supports this.\n  - See [Specify caching for sequences](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#sequence-caching) for full details.\n- Specify fill-factor for keys and indexes\n  - EF9 supports specification of the SQL Server fill-factor when using EF Core Migrations to create keys and indexes.\n  - See [Specify fill-factor for keys and indexes](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#fill-factor) for full details.\n\n## Improved tooling\n\n- Fewer rebuilds when using `dotnet ef` tools\n  - EF9 invalidates build caches less often, resulting in faster re-builds. \n  - See [Fewer rebuilds](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#fewer-rebuilds) for full details.\n\n## Everything else in preview 2\n\nPreview 2 contains:\n\n- [8 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement)\n- [10 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 2 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 1 are:\n\n- @​Poppyto: [stackalloc for BytesToDecimal](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31190)\n- @​francopettinari: [Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core issue with multiple Blob colums](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/32770)\n- @​wertzui: [Added `ToHashSetAsync<T>` Extension methods on `IQueryable<T>`](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/32905)\n- @​Suchiman: [Fix incremental builds](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/32860)\n- @​btecu: [Cleanup asserts](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/32968)\n- @​EngincanV: [Fix typos on DeleteBehavior.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/32781)\n- @​petterh: [Fix typos, doubled words](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/32372)\n- @​deano-hunter: [Add fill factor to keys and unique constraints](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/32900)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.1.24081.2\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 1. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are also several smaller enhancements included in preview 1. One of these might be just the thing you have been waiting for, so read on!\n\n- [Discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues)\n- [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew) documentation.\n- [Documentation & Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs)\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Prune columns passed to OPENJSON's WITH clause\n  - EF9 removes unnecessary columns when calling `OPENJSON WITH`.\n  - See [_Prune columns from JSON_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Translations involving GREATEST/LEAST\n  - Several new translations have been introduced that use the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions.\n  - This includes translations of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` in non-aggregate queries, as well as directly exposing the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions in relational providers.\n  - See [_GREATEST/LEAST translations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Force or prevent query parameterization\n  - Except in some special cases, EF Core parameterizes variables used in a LINQ query, but includes constants in the generated SQL. EF9 allows constants to be translated to parameters and variables to be translated to constants on a case to case basis.\n  - See [_Force or prevent query parameterization_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#force-or-prevent-query-parameterization) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## ExecuteUpdate\n\n- Allow passing complex type instances to ExecuteUpdate\n  - EF9 supports directly passing complex type instances to `ExecuteUpdate` as sugar for updating all member values.\n  - See [_ExecuteUpdate for complex types_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#allow-passing-complex-type-instances-to-executeupdate) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Temporal tables\n\n- Small migrations for temporal tables\n  - The migration created when changing an existing table into a temporal table has been reduced in size for EF9.\n  - See [_Improved temporal table migrations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#improved-temporal-table-migrations) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Model building\n\n- Make existing model building conventions more extensible\n  - In EF9, we have made it easier to extend some of the existing conventions, such as those for property and key discovery.\n  - See [_Extensible model building conventions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#make-existing-model-building-conventions-more-extensible) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors\n  - In EF9, we have both improved the error messages generated when this fails, and also enabled instantiation by non-public constructor.\n  - See [_ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#update-applyconfigurationsfromassembly-to-call-non-public-constructors) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Everything else in Preview 1\n\n Preview 1 contains:\n \n- [30 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [51 bug fixes in EF9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n   - [8 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.1+is%3Aclosed)\n   - [25 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.2](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed+)\n ...

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 2, many contributed by our community.

One of these might be just the thing you have been waiting for, so read on!\n\n- [Discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues)\n- [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew) documentation.\n- [Documentation & Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs)\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Prune columns passed to OPENJSON's WITH clause\n  - EF9 removes unnecessary columns when calling `OPENJSON WITH`.\n  - See [_Prune columns from JSON_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Translations involving GREATEST/LEAST\n  - Several new translations have been introduced that use the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions.\n  - This includes translations of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` in non-aggregate queries, as well as directly exposing the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions in relational providers.\n  - See [_GREATEST/LEAST translations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Force or prevent query parameterization\n  - Except in some special cases, EF Core parameterizes variables used in a LINQ query, but includes constants in the generated SQL. EF9 allows constants to be translated to parameters and variables to be translated to constants on a case to case basis.\n  - See [_Force or prevent query parameterization_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#force-or-prevent-query-parameterization) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## ExecuteUpdate\n\n- Allow passing complex type instances to ExecuteUpdate\n  - EF9 supports directly passing complex type instances to `ExecuteUpdate` as sugar for updating all member values.\n  - See [_ExecuteUpdate for complex types_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#allow-passing-complex-type-instances-to-executeupdate) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Temporal tables\n\n- Small migrations for temporal tables\n  - The migration created when changing an existing table into a temporal table has been reduced in size for EF9.\n  - See [_Improved temporal table migrations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#improved-temporal-table-migrations) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Model building\n\n- Make existing model building conventions more extensible\n  - In EF9, we have made it easier to extend some of the existing conventions, such as those for property and key discovery.\n  - See [_Extensible model building conventions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#make-existing-model-building-conventions-more-extensible) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors\n  - In EF9, we have both improved the error messages generated when this fails, and also enabled instantiation by non-public constructor.\n  - See [_ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#update-applyconfigurationsfromassembly-to-call-non-public-constructors) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Everything else in Preview 1\n\n Preview 1 contains:\n \n- [30 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [51 bug fixes in EF9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n   - [8 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.1+is%3Aclosed)\n   - [25 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.2](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed+)\n ... (truncated)\n\n## 8.0.17\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\n- **Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade** ([#​36085](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36085))  \n  Updates the project's dependencies using the latest versions from the dotnet/arcade repository. This ensures that the build infrastructure and related tooling are up to date, which can bring in important bug fixes, security patches, and improvements from upstream.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **Update branding to 8.0.17** ([#​36043](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36043))  \n  Updates the internal version branding to 8.0.17. This change ensures that the product and its packages correctly reflect the new release version, helping users and developers identify the build.\n\n- **Merging internal commits for release/8.0** ([#​36080](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36080))  \n  Integrates various internal commits into the release/8.0 branch. This merge brings together important updates and ensures the release branch is synchronized with recent internal development, maintaining consistency and stability for the release.\n\n---\n\nThis summary is generated and may contain inaccuracies.

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find.

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

One of these might be just the thing you have been waiting for, so read on!\n\n- [Discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues)\n- [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew) documentation.\n- [Documentation & Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs)\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Prune columns passed to OPENJSON's WITH clause\n  - EF9 removes unnecessary columns when calling `OPENJSON WITH`.\n  - See [_Prune columns from JSON_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Translations involving GREATEST/LEAST\n  - Several new translations have been introduced that use the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions.\n  - This includes translations of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` in non-aggregate queries, as well as directly exposing the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions in relational providers.\n  - See [_GREATEST/LEAST translations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Force or prevent query parameterization\n  - Except in some special cases, EF Core parameterizes variables used in a LINQ query, but includes constants in the generated SQL. EF9 allows constants to be translated to parameters and variables to be translated to constants on a case to case basis.\n  - See [_Force or prevent query parameterization_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#force-or-prevent-query-parameterization) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## ExecuteUpdate\n\n- Allow passing complex type instances to ExecuteUpdate\n  - EF9 supports directly passing complex type instances to `ExecuteUpdate` as sugar for updating all member values.\n  - See [_ExecuteUpdate for complex types_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#allow-passing-complex-type-instances-to-executeupdate) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Temporal tables\n\n- Small migrations for temporal tables\n  - The migration created when changing an existing table into a temporal table has been reduced in size for EF9.\n  - See [_Improved temporal table migrations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#improved-temporal-table-migrations) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Model building\n\n- Make existing model building conventions more extensible\n  - In EF9, we have made it easier to extend some of the existing conventions, such as those for property and key discovery.\n  - See [_Extensible model building conventions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#make-existing-model-building-conventions-more-extensible) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors\n  - In EF9, we have both improved the error messages generated when this fails, and also enabled instantiation by non-public constructor.\n  - See [_ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#update-applyconfigurationsfromassembly-to-call-non-public-constructors) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Everything else in Preview 1\n\n Preview 1 contains:\n \n- [30 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [51 bug fixes in EF9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n   - [8 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.1+is%3Aclosed)\n   - [25 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.2](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed+)\n ...

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 5. For full details, see [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew). To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n## Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 5, these include:\n\n- Support for hierarchical partition keys\n- Use of any numeric, bool, string, or value-converted type as a partition key\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Query translation improvements\n\nEF9 preview 5 contains three small enhancements to query translation:\n\n- Optimization of queries using `Count != 0` or `Count > 0`\n- Translations for `TimeOnly.FromDateTime` and `TimeOnly.FromTimeSpan`\n\nSee [LINQ and SQL translation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#linq-and-sql-translation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 5\n\nPreview 5 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [6 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview5+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 5 and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite contain work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla).\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.4.24267.1\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 4. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 4.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Enhanced database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL\n\nWe are working on significant updates in EF9 to the EF Core database provider for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community. The community PRs in EF9 Preview 4 are:\n\n- @​y0ung3r: [InMemoryTable: Make IsConcurrencyConflict() method more readable](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/33561)\n\n\n## 9.0.0-preview.3.24172.4\n\nThe team has been working primarily on EF Core internals, so there are no new big features in EF Core 9 (EF9) Preview 3. However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 3.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure. See [Sugar for HierarchyId path generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#hierarchyid-path-generation) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Everything else in preview 3\n\nPreview 3 contains:\n\n- [6 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [5 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 3 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

However, this means we really need people like you to run your code on these new internals and report back what you find. We want to fix bugs in the new internals as soon as possible in order to have a strong GA release later in the year.\n\nThat being said, there are several smaller enhancements included in preview 2, many contributed by our community.

One of these might be just the thing you have been waiting for, so read on!\n\n- [Discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues)\n- [What's new in EF Core 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew) documentation.\n- [Documentation & Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs)\n\n## Improved queries\n\n- Prune columns passed to OPENJSON's WITH clause\n  - EF9 removes unnecessary columns when calling `OPENJSON WITH`.\n  - See [_Prune columns from JSON_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Translations involving GREATEST/LEAST\n  - Several new translations have been introduced that use the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions.\n  - This includes translations of `Math.Min` and `Math.Max` in non-aggregate queries, as well as directly exposing the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` SQL functions in relational providers.\n  - See [_GREATEST/LEAST translations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#prune-columns-passed-to-openjsons-with-clause) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- Force or prevent query parameterization\n  - Except in some special cases, EF Core parameterizes variables used in a LINQ query, but includes constants in the generated SQL. EF9 allows constants to be translated to parameters and variables to be translated to constants on a case to case basis.\n  - See [_Force or prevent query parameterization_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#force-or-prevent-query-parameterization) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## ExecuteUpdate\n\n- Allow passing complex type instances to ExecuteUpdate\n  - EF9 supports directly passing complex type instances to `ExecuteUpdate` as sugar for updating all member values.\n  - See [_ExecuteUpdate for complex types_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#allow-passing-complex-type-instances-to-executeupdate) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Temporal tables\n\n- Small migrations for temporal tables\n  - The migration created when changing an existing table into a temporal table has been reduced in size for EF9.\n  - See [_Improved temporal table migrations_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#improved-temporal-table-migrations) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Model building\n\n- Make existing model building conventions more extensible\n  - In EF9, we have made it easier to extend some of the existing conventions, such as those for property and key discovery.\n  - See [_Extensible model building conventions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#make-existing-model-building-conventions-more-extensible) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n- ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors\n  - In EF9, we have both improved the error messages generated when this fails, and also enabled instantiation by non-public constructor.\n  - See [_ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly calls non-public constructors_](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#update-applyconfigurationsfromassembly-to-call-non-public-constructors) in the What's New docs for full details including runnable samples.\n\n## Everything else in Preview 1\n\n Preview 1 contains:\n \n- [30 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [51 bug fixes in EF9 Preview 1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview1+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n   - [8 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.1+is%3Aclosed)\n   - [25 bug fixes also shipped in 8.0.2](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed+)\n ... (truncated)\n\n## 8.0.17\n\n## Dependency Updates\n\n- **Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade** ([#​36085](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36085))  \n  Updates the project's dependencies using the latest versions from the dotnet/arcade repository. This ensures that the build infrastructure and related tooling are up to date, which can bring in important bug fixes, security patches, and improvements from upstream.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **Update branding to 8.0.17** ([#​36043](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36043))  \n  Updates the internal version branding to 8.0.17. This change ensures that the product and its packages correctly reflect the new release version, helping users and developers identify the build.\n\n- **Merging internal commits for release/8.0** ([#​36080](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/36080))  \n  Integrates various internal commits into the release/8.0 branch. This merge brings together important updates and ensures the release branch is synchronized with recent internal development, maintaining consistency and stability for the release.\n\n---\n\nThis summary is generated and may contain inaccuracies.
