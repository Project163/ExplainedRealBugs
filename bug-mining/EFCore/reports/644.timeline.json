([#114678](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/114678))**  \n  Improves HTTP performance by caching certificates in WinHttpHandler, reducing redundant calls to custom certificate validation and speeding up secure connections.\n\n- **Improve distribute_free_regions ([#115167](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/115167))**  \n  Optimizes memory management by enhancing the algorithm for distributing free memory regions, leading to better memory utilization and potentially improved application performance.\n\n## Technical Improvements\n\n- **Strip trailing slash from source dir for cmake4 ([#114905](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/114905))**  \n  Refines build scripts by removing trailing slashes from source directories when using CMake 4, preventing potential build path issues and improving build reliability.\n\n- **Don't expose TrustedCertificatesDirectory() and StartNewTlsSessionContext() to NetFx ([#114995](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/114995))**  \n  Restricts certain internal APIs from being exposed to .NET Framework, reducing surface area and preventing unintended usage.\n\n- **Add support for more libicu versions ([#115376](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/115376))**  \n  Expands compatibility by supporting additional versions of the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, enhancing globalization features across more environments.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n- **Run outerloop pipeline only for release branches, not staging/preview ([#115011](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/115011))**  \n  Optimizes CI/CD resources by limiting the outerloop pipeline to run only on release branches, reducing unnecessary test runs and speeding up development workflows.\n\n ...

potentially improved application performance.\n\n## Technical Improvements\n\n- **Strip trailing slash from source dir for cmake4 ([#​114905](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/114905))**  \n  Refines build scripts by removing trailing slashes from source directories when using CMake 4, preventing potential build path issues and improving build reliability.\n\n- **Don't expose TrustedCertificatesDirectory() and StartNewTlsSessionContext() to NetFx ([#​114995](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/114995))**  \n  Restricts certain internal APIs from being exposed to .NET Framework, reducing surface area and preventing unintended usage.\n\n- **Add support for more libicu versions ([#​115376](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/115376))**  \n  Expands compatibility by supporting additional versions of the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, enhancing globalization features across more environments.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n- **Run outerloop
