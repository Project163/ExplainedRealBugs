`Distinct_skip_without_orderby` and `Distinct_take_without_orderby` in `ComplexNavigationsQueryTestBase` looks bugged.  They behavior is:\r\n\r\n1. Distinct over set of values - returns items in uknown order\r\n2. Take/Skip part of values - take items from unordered set\r\n3. Do OrderBy() \r\n\r\nSince Take/Skip operation is being made on unordered set of items it may return items in random order. If we look into expected sql code in `ComplexNavigationsSharedTypeQuerySqlServerTest.Distinct_skip_without_orderby` we can clearly see that ordering is being made after skip (`OFFSET`) operation. The fact, that this test passes is just (highly probable in SqlServer) coincidence. Those tests don't pass on Postgresql ([old closed issue](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/22532)) and neither on [Snowflake](https://github.com/Sielnix/EFCore.Snowflake).\r\n\r\nEF Core version: v8.0.4\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework: .NET 8.0\r\nOperating system: any\r\nIDE: any\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33590/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
