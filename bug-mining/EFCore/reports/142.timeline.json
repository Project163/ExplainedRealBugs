This causes us to propagate the wrong database-generated value into the wrong entity property.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\n\r\nWhen mixing both stored procedure and non-stored procedure updates in the same SaveChanges batch, database-generated values may cause an exception, or even get assigned to the wrong entity property (bad data).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\n\r\nCustomer reported on 7.0\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nAdded a test for the affected scenario.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow; the fix is quite trivial, and a quirk was added to revert back to

For example, consider this table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE [Members] (\r\n    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,\r\n    [Name] nvarchar(max) NULL,\r\n    [IsActive] bit NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST(1 AS bit),\r\n    CONSTRAINT [PK_Member] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF8 now parses literal values in column default constraints, allowing `HasDefaultValue` to be scaffolded instead of `HasDefaultValyeSql`. For example, `CAST(1 AS bit)` is parsed as `true`:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Member>(entity =>\r\n{\r\n    entity.Property(e => e.IsActive).HasDefaultValue(true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF checks the value of a property to determine whether or not to let the database generate a value. Starting with EF8, [this check can be customized](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/701). This means that EF8 will send `false` to the database when needed, since database default is known to be `true`. \r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n- Major progress on value objects with the merge of [_Add complex types to Metadata_](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31003).\r\n- A PR with changes to JSON serialization is [out for review](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31160)\r\n- Unfortunately, the [T4 tooling changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/plan#first-class-t4-templates-in-visual-studio) planned for Visual Studio have been cut.\r\n\r\n## EF Core 8 (EF8)\r\n\r\nEF Core 8 (EF8) will be the next release after EF Core 7.0. It will be released alongside .NET 8 in November 2023.\r\n\r\nThe [EF Core 8 Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/plan) is available publicly in our documentation. As always, [feedback is greatly appreciated](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29853).

https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/issues/1164. The parameter InstrumentModulesWithoutLocalSources has been removed. since it can be handled by setting ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to None.\nThe default heuristics for determining whether to instrument an assembly has been changed. In previous versions any missing source file was taken as a signal that it was a third-party project that shouldn't be instrumented, with exceptions for some common file name patterns for source generators. Now only assemblies where no source files at all can be found are excluded from instrumentation, and the code for detecting source generator files have been removed. To get back to the behaviour that at least one missing file is sufficient to exclude an assembly, set ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to MissingAny, or use assembly exclusion filters for more fine-grained control.\n\n[Diff between 3.2.0 and 6.0.0](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/compare/v5.7.2...v6.0.0)\n\n## 5.8.0\n\n### Fixed\n-Fix TypeLoadException when referencing
