summary - ultimately this was a bug in CloningExpressionVisitor, which didn't clone `SelectExpression._clientProjections`. Details:\r\n\r\n* When an owned entity is present, nav expansion adds `Select(x => IncludeExpression(...)`.\r\n* TranslateSelect \"fails\" to translate IncludeExpression, and switches to \"client projection\" mode; this means that the SelectExpression no longer has `_projectionMapping`, but instead has `_clientProjections`. I'm not clear on why things work this way for IncludeExpression.\r\n* When a complex query happens with ExecuteDelete which cannot be natively supported by the provider (OrderBy().Skip() in the above query), we do a subquery pushdown, doing `DELETE ... WHERE Id IN (...)`.\r\n* That code path embeds the already-translated ShapedQueryExpression inside a synthesized, pre-translated LINQ expression tree, and translates it. Such mixing of pre-translated LINQ Expression nodes with already-translated ones seems problematic.\r\n* When translation reaches the ShapedQueryExpression, it clones it, presumably to prevent referencing the same potentially mutable SelectExpression from two places.\r\n* CloningExpressionVisitor had a bug where it didn't clone the client projections on the SelectExpression. So we ended up with a SelectExpression that has no projection at all.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1892004994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11489982642,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs58FmrwzwAAAAKs2ziy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11489982642","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"650b34eac2528825f274bf726dc5abe10894ff33","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/650b34eac2528825f274bf726dc5abe10894ff33","created_at":"2024-01-15T15:59:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11490082389,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs58FmrwzwAAAAKs3L5V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11490082389","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3a8babe969a88b57305bdf6b64b92bfcdbbd60a9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/3a8babe969a88b57305bdf6b64b92bfcdbbd60a9","created_at":"2024-01-15T16:09:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-15T18:59:01Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T18:59:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29690","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29690/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/do

I'm just switching the behavior from loading records in and then deleting them (i.e., `ToListAsync()` then `RemoveRange()` and `SaveChangesAsync()`) to using the new method which should delete everything in one trip to the database (i.e., `ExecuteDeleteAsync` )\r\n\r\n### Include your code\r\n\r\nMinimal Reproduction: https://github.com/the-avid-engineer/EFCoreBug\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what expression I use, including `.Where(x => true)` - they all throw this exception.\r\n\r\nI saw another issue where someone mentions `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` #28137, and they mentioned owned types. I can confirm that this seems related to the `OwnsOne` relationship - the exception is not thrown for `HasOne` nor `OwnsMany`\r\n\r\nMy package (not this minimal reproduction) uses the Npgsql driver, but the issue persists even if I switch my tests to SQLite, so it doesn't appear to be a driver-specific issue.\r\n\r\n### Include stack traces\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnhandled exception.
