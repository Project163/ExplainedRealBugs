https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/issues/1164. The parameter InstrumentModulesWithoutLocalSources has been removed. since it can be handled by setting ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to None.\nThe default heuristics for determining whether to instrument an assembly has been changed. In previous versions any missing source file was taken as a signal that it was a third-party project that shouldn't be instrumented, with exceptions for some common file name patterns for source generators. Now only assemblies where no source files at all can be found are excluded from instrumentation, and the code for detecting source generator files have been removed. To get back to the behaviour that at least one missing file is sufficient to exclude an assembly, set ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to MissingAny, or use assembly exclusion filters for more fine-grained control.\n\n[Diff between 3.2.0 and 6.0.0](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/compare/v5.7.2...v6.0.0)\n\n## 5.8.0\n\n### Fixed\n-Fix TypeLoadException when referencing

https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/issues/1164. The parameter InstrumentModulesWithoutLocalSources has been removed. since it can be handled by setting ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to None.\nThe default heuristics for determining whether to instrument an assembly has been changed. In previous versions any missing source file was taken as a signal that it was a third-party project that shouldn't be instrumented, with exceptions for some common file name patterns for source generators. Now only assemblies where no source files at all can be found are excluded from instrumentation, and the code for detecting source generator files have been removed. To get back to the behaviour that at least one missing file is sufficient to exclude an assembly, set ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to MissingAny, or use assembly exclusion filters for more fine-grained control.\n\n[Diff between 3.2.0 and 6.0.0](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/compare/v5.7.2...v6.0.0)\n\n## 5.8.0\n\n### Fixed\n-Fix TypeLoadException when referencing

notes</summary>\n\n_Sourced from [Dapper's releases](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/releases)._\n\n## 2.1.66\n\nWARNING: `DateOnly` / `TimeOnly` support, added in 2.1.37, had multiple failure modes, and was quickly reverted pending finding the time to investigate what went wrong. The impacted packages were unlisted, with 2.1.35 being the last listed version. This is the first version *after* that debacle, which means if you are using the impacted 2.1.37 or similar: this version will effectively *remove* functionality (although it was actually disabled a very long time ago).\n\n---\n\n## What's Changed\n* TFM update; +net8 (LTS), -net5, -net7 by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2144\n* normalize async API surface over all TFMs by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2144\n* disable DateOnly / TimeOnly support by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2080\n* change dapper-plus citation by @​mgravell in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2083\n* Do not close the inner reader when disposing wrapped data readers by @​0xced in https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper/pull/2100\n* CI -
