are running into an issue while trying to set an infinite timeout for our dbcontext. \r\nDuring startup we are configuring our context with UseSqlServer und setting CommandTimeout on the builder.\r\n`options.UseSqlServer(connectionString, builder => builder.CommandTimeout(0));`\r\n\r\nThis calls WithCommandTimeout internally and throws an exception for values <= 0.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/e9b942badcbe6a24518a1f4953251585e8dad8b7/src/EFCore.Relational/Infrastructure/RelationalOptionsExtension.cs#L163-L170\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.infrastructure.relationaldbcontextoptionsbuilder-2.commandtimeout?view=efcore-8.0#microsoft-entityframeworkcore-infrastructure-relationaldbcontextoptionsbuilder-2-commandtimeout(system-nullable((system-int32)))) lists 0 as a valid value.\r\n\r\nSetting the timeout with context.Database.SetCommandTimeout(0) or context.Database.SetCommandTimeout(Timeout.Infinite) works as expected.\r\n\r\nShould be a small change. We could create a PR if you'd like.","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
