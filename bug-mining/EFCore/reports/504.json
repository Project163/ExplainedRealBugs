Server has a limitation, where it doesn't allow aggregate functions invocations over other aggregate functions, or over subqueries; it errors with: \"Cannot perform an aggregate function on an expression containing an aggregate or a subquery\".\n\nExamples:\n\n```c#\n// Aggregate over scalar subquery\n_ = await context.Blogs\n    .Select(b => new\n    {\n        b.Category,\n        FirstPostViews = b.Posts.OrderBy(p => p.Id).FirstOrDefault()!.Views\n    })\n    .GroupBy(x => x.Category)\n    .Select(g => g.Sum(x => x.FirstPostViews))\n    .ToListAsync();\n\n// Aggregate over aggregate\n_ = await context.Blogs\n    .Select(b => new\n    {\n        b.Category,\n        FirstPostViews = b.Posts.Sum(p => p.Views)\n    })\n    .GroupBy(x => x.Category)\n    .Select(g => g.Sum(x => x.FirstPostViews))\n    .ToListAsync();\n```\n\nThe invalid SQL looks like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM((\n    SELECT TOP(1) [p].[Views]\n    FROM [Post] AS [p]\n    WHERE [b].[Id] = [p].[BlogId]\n    ORDER BY [p].[Id]))\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\nGROUP BY [b].[Category];\n\nSELECT SUM((\n    SELECT SUM([p].[Views])\n    FROM [Post] AS [p]\n    WHERE [b].[Id] = [p].[BlogId]))\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\nGROUP BY [b].[Category]\n```\n\nWe should be able to have a post-processing step that lifts the subquery out of the projection, and integrates it into the SELECT expression as a OUTER APPLY (or CROSS JOIN, if uncorrelated):\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(x.Views)\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\nOUTER APPLY (\n    SELECT TOP(1) [p].[Views]\n    FROM [Post] AS [p]\n    WHERE [b].[Id] = [p].[BlogId]\n    ORDER BY [p].[Id]\n) AS [x]\nGROUP BY [b].[Category];\n\nSELECT SUM([x].[ViewSum])\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\nOUTER APPLY (\n    SELECT SUM([p].[Views]) AS [ViewSum]\n    FROM [Post] AS [p]\n    WHERE [b].[Id] = [p].[BlogId]) AS [x]\nGROUP BY [b].[Category]\n```\n\nNote that this affects non-GroupBy queries as well.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Full code</summary>\n\n```c#\nawait using var context = new
