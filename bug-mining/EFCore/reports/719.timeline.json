This led to resource contention, 100% CPU usage, and 503 errors. The fix moves CosmosClient initialization to the constructor and simplifies the conditional logic for better maintainability.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nIn high-throughput multi-threaded applications this caused resource contention, 100% CPU usage, and 503 errors. There isn't a viable workaround.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer reported. This likely affects many EF Cosmos users to some degree but hasn't been reported before as it usually doesn't manifest itself in a reproducible manner.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nTest added\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. Localized change moving from lazy initialization to constructor initialization, which is more straightforward and eliminates thread safety concerns entirely.\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!
