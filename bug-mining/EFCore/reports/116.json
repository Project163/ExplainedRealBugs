have the following LINQ query in my VB code:\r\n\r\n            Dim testq = From cf In dbContxt.Cashflows\r\n                        Where cf.Date >= #4/1/2022# And cf.Deposit IsNot Nothing\r\n                        Select cf.Date\r\n\r\nIt produced the following SQL in EF Core 6.0 (using testq.ToQueryString()):\r\n\r\nSELECT \"c\".\"Date\" \r\nFROM \"Cashflows\" AS \"c\"\r\nWHERE (\"c\".\"Date\" >= '2022-04-01 00:00:00') & (\"c\".\"Deposit\" IS NOT NULL)\r\n\r\nIn EF Core 7.0, I am getting a different result, which changes the order of operations of the query:\r\n\r\nSELECT \"c\".\"Date\" \r\nFROM \"Cashflows\" AS \"c\"\r\nWHERE (\"c\".\"Date\" >= '2022-04-01 00:00:00') & \"c\".\"Deposit\" IS NOT NULL\r\n\r\nNote that if I change the query to:\r\n\r\n            Dim testq = From cf In dbContxt.Cashflows\r\n                        Where cf.Date >= #4/1/2022# AndAlso cf.Deposit IsNot Nothing\r\n                        Select cf.Date\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\nSELECT \"c\".\"Date\" \r\nFROM \"Cashflows\" AS \"c\"\r\nWHERE \"c\".\"Date\" >= '2022-04-01 00:00:00' AND \"c\".\"Deposit\" IS NOT NULL\r\n\r\nThis works around the issue, giving me the same results I got in EF Core
