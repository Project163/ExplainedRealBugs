have:\r\n* EF EntityFrameworkCore (7.0.5)\r\n* Database provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\n* Target framework: .NET 7.0\r\n* Automapper last version (12.0.1)\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\nEntity with Owned property. Map to DTO via \"ProjectTo\".\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the mapping works only in the situation when all the properties are filled in, otherwise the owned property is not mapped. In my opinion, it happens due to the fact that the expression translation \r\n(where the comparison with the empty model is done) checks if all properties of the owned model are filled in instead of checking the filling in of one property, at least.  \r\n\r\nMy example: https://github.com/d-kistanov-parc/EF_Automapper_Error_OwnType/blob/master/ConsoleApp/Program.cs\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, when i use ProjectTo method, the following Expression is formed:\r\n```\r\ndb.Requests.ProjectTo<RequestDto>(config).Expression\t\r\n{\r\n\t[Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.EntityQueryRootExpression]\r\n\t.Select(dtoRequest => new RequestDto() \r\n\t{\r\n\t\tId = dtoRequest.Id, \r\n\t\tInfo = IIF((dtoRequest.Info == default(Object)), null, new RequestInfoDto() \r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tText = dtoRequest.Info.Text, \r\n\t\t\tNumber = dtoRequest.Info.Number\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t})\r\n}\tSystem.Linq.Expressions.Expression {System.Linq.Expressions.MethodCallExpression2}\r\n```\r\nEntityFramework translates it into:\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n\t[r].[Id], \r\n\tCASE\r\n\t\tWHEN([r].[Info_Number] IS NULL) OR ([r].[Info_Text] IS NULL) THEN CAST(1 AS bit)\r\n\t\tELSE CAST(0 AS bit)\r\n\tEND,\r\n\t[r].[Info_Text],\r\n\t[r].[Info_Number]\r\nFROM[Requests] AS[r]\r\n```\r\nI have got a question. Why is there \"OR\" operator, not \"AND\" ?","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30996/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
