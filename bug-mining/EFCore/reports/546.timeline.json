see minimal repro below.\r\n\r\n* ExecuteDelete/Update take as input the SelectExpression that was translated so far, just prior to their appearance; that SelectExpression is assumed to be reading the tables, so references views rather than tables.\r\n* Note that the query may reference multiples tables. The additional tables (not the one being mutated) **do** need to be views, as we're reading from them. But during translation, we don't know which table is being updated - the user can start from one root, and project out a navigation to be deleted. So we only know the target table at the end of translation.\r\n* That means that the fix here is likely to add handling when translating ExecuteUpdate/Delete, to detect this case and swap out the view TableExpressionBase with the corresponding table TableExpressionBase.\r\n* For ExecuteDelete, that's likely to be relatively easy - the query just before ExecuteDelete must project out an entity type, so we can just find its (only) table.

The additional tables (not the one being mutated) do need to be views, as we're reading from them. But during translation, we don't know which table is being updated - the user can start from one root, and project out a navigation to be deleted. So we only know the target table at the end of translation.\r\n\r\nSo the approach here is to detect the case where the table to be changed is a view, find the table corresponding to that view, and replace it in the SelectExpression.\r\n\r\nNote that handling ExecuteUpdate where the property to set is a complex type and there's a vide mapping isn't yet supported; this is blocking on
