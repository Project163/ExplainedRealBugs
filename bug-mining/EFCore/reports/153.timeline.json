Probably will need to use the resulting collections and access their required elements. We need to pay attention to ordering of things, so that we don't access the element in JSON collection before that collection has been populated. We could maybe use similar strategy as include does - store those expressions in separate list, so that when we construct the final block expression, those collection accesses come after.\r\n\r\nUntil this is done, all queries projecting JSON which accesses element in a collection must be set to no-tracking, even if the owner entity is also projected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7849450096,"node_id":"LE_lADOAPaMMs5V7GwKzwAAAAHT3Rpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/7849450096","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-19T11:14:24Z","label":{"name":"needs-design","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1320863869","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29513#issuecomment-1320863869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/29513","id":1320863869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5Oush9","user":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-19T11:27:36Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T11:27:36Z","body":"to answer @roji 's question from the other thread:\r\n\r\n> is this deduplication something we do in non-JSON cases (e.g. for owned collections or collection includes)?\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n> One = x.MyNonJsonCollection\r\n> Two = x.MyNonJsonCollection.First()\r\n\r\nOwned collections and non-owned entities have their own keys, whereas JSON collections use their position in the collection as part of the key. If the entities are no tracking we can just populate those keys with dummy values, but for tracking queries we would need the correct values, otherwise we will get incorrect results (collections added in wrong places etc).\r\n\r\nOn top of that, we can't use ChangeTracker to deduplicate in Tracking scenarios (even though the entity materializer code already does that for us) and leave no tracking

Every array access needs to be recorded and incorporated into the key later. Constants can be stored directly by value, non-constants are added to projection, and we keep track of the projection index instead.\r\n\r\n- added JsonProjectionInfo in place of a value tuple to store shaping info needed for JSON, so that it's more readable,\r\n- reworked JsonShapingPreProcess to generate and cache key values as well as JsonElement.\r\n- moved dangling (i.e. not coming from
