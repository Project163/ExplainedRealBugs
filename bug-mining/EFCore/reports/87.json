We should allow for individual properties to be modified (if only 1 property in the entity has been changed there is no need to update the entire entity).\r\n\r\nThis should be relatively easy - currently we use List<JsonPartialUpdatePathEntry> to reason about common update path, we would need to make this a separate structure with an optional IProperty (set if only 1 property on a given entry has been modified). We can populate the IProperty after we have created the path object in FindJsonPartialUpdateInfo, and then tweak JsonNode generation code if we detect there is a non-null IProperty value for the fragment we are supposed to generate.\r\n\r\nI tried that initially but hit some SQL weirdness, where the json element that was being saved as a string rather than object. Just need a bit more research.","closed_by":{"login":"smitpatel","id":1528107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjgxMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel","html_url":"https://github.com/smitpatel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smitpatel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
