If we set DoNotAllowNull in AutoMapper config it will always create the new object no matter the values of the properties. Here is what I did:\r\n\r\nIn AutoMapper config add this\r\n```cs\r\nCreateMap<Location, LocationResponse>()\r\n                .ForMember(dest => dest.Address, opt => opt.DoNotAllowNull())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis changes the Expression that AutoMapper generates to this\r\n```cs\r\n[Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query.EntityQueryRootExpression]\r\n    .AsNoTracking()\r\n    .Where(x => !x.IsDeleted && (x.BusinessId == AuthService.GetBusinessIdFromRequestDomain()))\r\n    .Select(\r\n        dtoLocation => new LocationResponse\r\n        {\r\n            Name = dtoLocation.Name,\r\n            Address = new AddressDetails\r\n                {\r\n                    Country = dtoLocation.Address.Country,\r\n                    City = dtoLocation.Address.City,\r\n                    Postcode = dtoLocation.Address.Postcode,\r\n                    District = dtoLocation.Address.District,\r\n                    Street = dtoLocation.Address.Street,\r\n                    StreetNumber = dtoLocation.Address.StreetNumber,\r\n                    Building = dtoLocation.Address.Building,\r\n                    Entrance = dtoLocation.Address.Entrance,\r\n                    Floor = dtoLocation.Address.Floor,\r\n                    Apartment = dtoLocation.Address.Apartment,\r\n                    AdditionalInformation = dtoLocation.Address.AdditionalInformation\r\n                }\r\n        })\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1630467946/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"georgyevv","id":13435068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDM1MDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13435068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv","html_url":"https://github.com/georgyevv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgyevv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1642386771","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30996#issuecomment-1642386771","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30996","id":1642386771,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5h5NVT","user":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-19T16:19:54Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T16:19:54Z","body":"Note for triage: this is a regression from 6.0.
