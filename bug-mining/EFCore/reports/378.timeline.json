thanks for your patience and sorry it took so long to get around to this.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot going on above - it's always a good idea to submit a short, minimal console program that demonstrates a single failing scenario (and ideally on a provider we maintain, as you've indeed done for PostgreSQL above). That can help cut down the time needed to investigate etc.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I've confirmed a failure that's reproducible with the following minimal console program:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nctx.Credits.Where(c => c.Id == 1)\r\n    .Join(ctx.Declarations,\r\n        c => c.DeclarationReference,\r\n        d => d.Reference,\r\n        (credit, declaration) => new {credit, declaration})\r\n    .ExecuteUpdate(calls => calls.SetProperty(\r\n        c => c.credit.DeclarationId,\r\n        c => c.declaration.Id));\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Full minimal repro</summary>\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nawait using var ctx = new BlogContext();\r\nawait ctx.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();\r\nawait ctx.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();\r\n\r\nctx.Credits.Where(c => c.Id == 1)\r\n    .Join(ctx.Declarations,\r\n        c => c.DeclarationReference,\r\n        d => d.Reference,\r\n        (credit, declaration) => new {credit, declaration})\r\n    .ExecuteUpdate(calls => calls.SetProperty(\r\n        c => c.credit.DeclarationId,\r\n        c => c.declaration.Id));\r\n\r\npublic class BlogContext : DbContext\r\n{\r\n    public virtual DbSet<Credit> Credits { get; set; }\r\n    public virtual DbSet<Declaration> Declarations { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n        => optionsBuilder\r\n            .UseSqlServer(\"Server=localhost;Database=test;User=SA;Password=Abcd5678;Connect Timeout=60;ConnectRetryCount=0;Encrypt=false\")\r\n            .LogTo(Console.WriteLine, LogLevel.Information)\r\n            .EnableSensitiveDataLogging();\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n        => modelBuilder.Entity<Credit>().OwnsOne(c => c.Period);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Credit\r\n{\r\n    public long Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string Reference { get; set; }\r\n    public string DeclarationReference { get; set; }\r\n    public Period Period { get; set; }\r\n    public long? DeclarationId { get; set; }\r\n    public Declaration? Declaration { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Period\r\n{\r\n    public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }\r\n    public DateTime EndDate { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Declaration\r\n{\r\n    public long Id { get; set; }\r\n    public string Reference { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThe cause is essentially the same as #30528 - the fact that entity has an owned entity causes nav expansion to inject an IncludeExpression into the query tree, which causes ExecuteUpdate to fail (and also is meaningless, since ExecuteUpdate doesn't query for anything). The fix in #30571 was to prune out the IncludeExpression, but this was done only when its found at the top of the shaper tree; but because of the join in the query above, the shaper contains an anonymous object with the IncludeExpression nested inside. The fix here is to visit recursively, pruning IncludeExpressions everywhere, and not only at the top.\r\n\r\nNote that complex properties don't cause IncludeExpressions to get injected, which is why there's no bug there.\r\n\r\n@anoordover if there are other problems you wanted to raise here, please open separate issues with minimal repros for those - I'll use this issue to track the above only.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1884683953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11442092930,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5z1t_BzwAAAAKqAHuC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11442092930","actor":{"login":"anoordover","id":5289365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODkzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5289365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover","html_url":"https://github.com/anoordover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-10T11:38:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11442092946,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs5z1t_BzwAAAAKqAHuS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11442092946","actor":{"login":"anoordover","id":5289365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODkzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5289365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover","html_url":"https://github.com/anoordover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anoordover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-10T11:38:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11442251363,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs5z1t_BzwAAAAKqAuZj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11442251363","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2eb2046d939b83d5aac83902324966b501f3f047","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roji/efcore/commits/2eb2046d939b83d5aac83902324966b501f3f047","created_at":"2024-01-10T11:53:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url"
