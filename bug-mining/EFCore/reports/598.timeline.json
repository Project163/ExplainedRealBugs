Rowversion migration regression from EF Core 8 to 9\n\nI'm in the process of upgrading an application from .NET 8 to 9.\n\nBut I'm running into problems when trying to run existing migrations that have been created with EF Core 8 and working for over a year now on multiple versions of EF Core (8.0.4 to 8.0.11)\n\nI have a migration that throws exceptions and can't complete at all on v9.0.0, but if I revert to 8.0.11 it works fine.\n\n### Include your code\n\nThe migration that fails is a rename of a table where we use rowversion configured like this:\n\n```C#\npublic void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Sensor> builder)\n{\n    builder.ToTable(nameof(MasterCatalogueDbContext.Sensors), schema: DatabaseConstants.MasterDataCatalogueSchemaName);\n\n    // Optimistic Concurrency token\n    builder.Property(p => p.RowVersion).IsRowVersion();\n}\n```\n\nWith this migration created for altering the rowversion column:\n```C#\nmigrationBuilder.AlterColumn<byte[]>(\n    name: \"RowVersion\",\n    schema: \"attributeList\",\n    table: \"MeasurementUnits\",\n    type: \"rowversion\",\n    rowVersion: true,\n    nullable: false,\n    defaultValue: Array.Empty<byte>(),\n    oldClrType: typeof(byte[]),\n    oldType: \"rowversion\",\n    oldRowVersion: true,\n    oldDefaultValue: Array.Empty<byte>())\n    .Annotation(\"SqlServer:IsTemporal\", true)\n    .Annotation(\"SqlServer:TemporalHistoryTableName\", \"MeasurementUnitsHistory\")\n    .Annotation(\"SqlServer:TemporalHistoryTableSchema\", \"attributeList\")\n    .Annotation(\"SqlServer:TemporalPeriodEndColumnName\", \"PeriodEnd\")\n    .Annotation(\"SqlServer:TemporalPeriodStartColumnName\", \"PeriodStart\")\n    .OldAnnotation(\"SqlServer:IsTemporal\",

.OldAnnotation(\"SqlServer:TemporalPeriodEndColumnName\", \"PeriodEnd\")\n    .OldAnnotation(\"SqlServer:TemporalPeriodStartColumnName\", \"PeriodStart\");\n```\n\nAnd that throws this error:\n```\n2024-11-14T15:17:05 [15:17:05 INF] Applying migration '20240610063634_RenameSensorUnitToMeasurementUnit'.\n2024-11-14T15:17:05 [15:17:05 ERR] Failed executing DbCommand (32ms)

In our main solution, because of this regression, we have Aspire running an ASP.NET Core 9 project using EFCore 8.  The main thing I think might not work is health checks against the ef context.  If you want a containerized SQL in development:\n\n```\nvar sql = builder.AddSqlServer(\"sql\")\n    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)\n    .AddDatabase(\"SomeProjectDevDb\");\n\nvar api = builder.AddProject<Projects.SomeProject_Api>(\"someproject-api\")\n    .WithReference(sql,\"DefaultConnection\") // <--- makes ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection get injected into config of api project\n\n```\nIf you don't want containerized SQL Server, just inject the connectionstring:\n```\nvar sql = builder.AddConnectionString(\"DefaultConnection\");\nvar api = builder.AddProject<Projects.SomeProject_Api>(\"someproject-api\")\n    .WithReference(sql,\"DefaultConnection\");\n ```\n\nIn the api, the implication is that instead of this:\n```\nbuilder.AddSqlServerDbContext<MyDbContext>(\"myConnection\");\n```\nWe just continue to do this, same as always:\n```\nbuilder.Services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>();\n```\n\nOf course we _do_ want to get to EFCore 9, but hopefully this makes it less of a block.\n\nIn our case, the impact is that we can't run integration tests under EFCore 9.  We have tests that create a blank database by running migrations, create a snapshot, then test and rollback snapshot after each test.  In this scenario, the migrations to create the database fail.  We also have code to let developers get a 'fresh' dev database from scratch. Again, the migrations fail in EFCore9, but not 8.\n\nA nuclear option that might work depending on the use of the migrations is to [reset

[@WolfspiritM](https://github.com/WolfspiritM) You can use Aspire with EFCore 8.\n\nThanks. My main issue was that the Aspire components for sqlserver were using efcore 9 packages.\nBut thanks to discord I figured out that Aspire 9 can be used with net8 and uses Efcore 8 packages then.\nI forgot that EfCore is part of the \"framework\" 😄 \n\nSo I will give Aspire 9 with net8 a try now until this issue is
