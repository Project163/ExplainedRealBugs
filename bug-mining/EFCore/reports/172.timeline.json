After that we reverse engineered the Database to a DbContext with models using powershell (script in the repository). This was working fine in EF 6. After migrating to EF 7 and regenerating the models, we are getting errors because it is looking for a singular table name, where it had to be a plural table name.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25003281/205065672-ad2b9934-0cba-4ff4-9320-078f65ea5219.png)\r\n\r\nEF 6 on the left and EF 7 on the right. .ToTable seems to be missing.

Some issues can be worked around by applying the fix to custom scaffolding templates. Others require manually updating the code after it's scaffolded. The incorrect models result in runtime exceptions about missing tables and columns.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nYes. Correct models were scaffolded in EF Core 6.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded automated tests covering more unconventional many-to-many join tables.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.
