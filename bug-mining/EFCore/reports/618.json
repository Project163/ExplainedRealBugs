In EF9 this has changed and we're getting an exception for entities that don't have an explicit `Id` property.\n\n`The entity type 'PlanningMovement' does not have a property mapped to the 'id' property in the database. Add a property mapped to 'id'.`\n\n### Include your code\n\nThe entity in question does not have an explicit `Id` property. Here is the db context configuration we've been using prior to EF9. Our partition key is configured as `/movementId` which is the reason for the json name mapping.\n\n```C#\nmodelBuilder.Entity<PlanningMovement>(builder =>\n{\n    builder.ToContainer(PlanningMovementContainerName)\n        .HasNoDiscriminator()\n        .HasPartitionKey(m => m.MovementId)\n        .HasKey(m => m.MovementId);\n\n    builder.UseETagConcurrency();\n\n    builder.Property(m => m.MovementId)\n        .ToJsonProperty(\"movementId\");\n});\n```\n\n### Include stack traces\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException:\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos.Infrastructure.Internal.CosmosModelValidator.ValidateKeys (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60)\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos.Infrastructure.Internal.CosmosModelValidator.Validate (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60)\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure.ModelRuntimeInitializer.Initialize (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60)\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure.ModelSource.GetModel (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60)\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Internal.DbContextServices.CreateModel (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60)\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Internal.DbContextServices.get_Model (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60)\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure.EntityFrameworkServicesBuilder+<>c.<TryAddCoreServices>b__8_4 (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=adb9793829ddae60)\n```\n\n### Include provider and version information\n\nEF Core version: 9.0.0\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos\nTarget framework: .NET 8.0\nOperating system: Windows 10\nIDE: Visual Studio 2022 17.12.3\n","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35325/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/35325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
