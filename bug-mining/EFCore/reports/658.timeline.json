This would allow two queries whose only different is a lambda parameter name to be considered the same in the query cache, slightly improving perf (in theory). Or are you seeing an additional problem here, such as an actual bug in EF behavior?\r\n\r\nI'm actually using `ExpressionEqualityComparer` on my own for an expression caching problem I have in my app, I happened to stumble into it and found out that it fits my use case, I then noticed that `GetHashCode` takes parameter names into account as part of its calculation while `Equals` doesn't and figured I should point this out here.\r\n\r\nThis very issue is causing the specific part of my app that's using `ExpressionEqualityComparer` to behave in an unexpected manner at times, and even though I'm not aware of any instances where this is actually causing a serious bug in EF itself, I believe that as a matter of principle, if you will, this could be considered a bug on its own.\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but the `GetHashCode` and `Equals` methods of an `IEqualityComparer` should always be consistent, in that when `Equals` returns `true` for two given values, you would expect `GetHashCode` to return identical hashes for those values as well. The current behavior violates this, and I'm not sure if that's somehow intentional?\r\n\r\nAnd even though \"correctness\" could be thought of as the main concern here, you're also right that fixing this would also theoretically improve EF's performance in some specific cases, since a LINQ query with an identical expression to a previous one, but with different parameter names, would result in a cache hit, as it _should_, I would argue, because as you yourself said:\r\n> ...lambda names really are meaningless when translating to SQL\r\n\r\nAnd therefore they shouldn't be part of the query cache key; currently, however, they effectively are.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1509923356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aradalvand","id":26527405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTI3NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26527405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand","html_url":"https://github.com/aradalvand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9015004304,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5jghYGzwAAAAIZVgyQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/9015004304","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-15T18:42:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9015004306,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs5jghYGzwAAAAIZVgyS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/9015004306","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-15T18:42:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1510180003","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/30697#issuecomment-1510180003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30697","id":1510180003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5aA4Sj","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-16T08:16:41Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T18:28:18Z","body":"Note that I don't think ExpressionEqualityComparer was meant for use as a general expression tree comparison facility, to be used externally.

Namely, it expects the parameter lists of the two given lambdas to be identical in number, type, and order; and then maps each parameter in lambda \"a\" to its counterpart **_with the same index/position_** in lambda \"b\" for later equality checks; meaning it's effectively doing something synonymous with what is now being done in `GetHashCode`:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/07284acdabd3ae4bdeca11ba2777a42ee6fec8bd/src/EFCore/Query/ExpressionEqualityComparer.cs#L393-L422\r\n\r\nThat said, we still do **fall back** to the parameter name in cases where the expression passed to `GetHashCode` is not a full lambda (i.e. say only `someLambda.Body`), because we have to. This is, once again, precisely what happens in `Equals` as well; specifically here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/07284acdabd3ae4bdeca11ba2777a42ee6fec8bd/src/EFCore/Query/ExpressionEqualityComparer.cs#L471\r\n\r\nThis is my very first time contributing to EF so feel free to let me know if I've made any mistakes.\r\n\r\nA few things:\r\n- I noticed that (at least) in the `ExpressionEqualityComparer`, `for` loops seem to have been preferred to `foreach` loops even when the latter could've also been used. I'm not sure why. I went with `foreach` in this newly-added code because the logic of the loop is dead simple. But let me know if this somehow matters and you want a `for` instead.\r\n- I'm not sure if I should add a test for this. It doesn't seem like a substantial enough change in my estimation. But let me know if I should.\r\n- One small thing I noticed (which is functionally inconsequential as far as I can tell but semantically weird) is the fact that in the `CompareParameter` method shown below, you're doing `mapped.Name == b`, as opposed to just `mapped == b`, while the latter would work too and is what actually makes sense — should I fix this too?\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/07284acdabd3ae4bdeca11ba2777a42ee6fec8bd/src/EFCore/Query/ExpressionEqualityComparer.cs#L469-L470\r\n---\r\n- [x] I've read the guidelines for
