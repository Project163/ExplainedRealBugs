If the type of the property being set (Blog.TextParts) and the type coming out of the value lambda is different, we attempt to apply a Convert node ([code](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore.Relational/Query/RelationalQueryableMethodTranslatingExpressionVisitor.cs#L1512)) which can fail (e.g. array property, List coming out of the selector - at least in PG).\r\n2. More importantly, the expression translated for NewTextParts in the anonymous object above is a CollectionResultExpression - this is what Select() returns when the thing being selected is an enumerable. We then attempt to (re-)translate that and fail.\r\n    * We should be able to make this work.\r\n    * But more generally, this raises the question of why we attempt to translate twice - once when translating the Select, and another time when translating the ExecuteUpdate's value selector lambda, into which we remap the lambda parameter (inserting a CollectionResultExpression into the lambda).\r\n    * This can be another argument against out general remapping approach. Instead of doing a pre-pass the remap the lambda parameter, and then having to skip re-translating the thing we remapped, if SQL translator simply encountered a parameter it could process it accordingly.\r\n\r\nOriginally raised by @srasch in https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/3001","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1837445579","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32493#issuecomment-1837445579","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32493","id":1837445579,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs5thTHL","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-03T11:06:33Z","updated_at":"2023-12-03T11:06:33Z","body":"Note: be careful when doing this, as it would break the PG provider, which currently depends on operators **not** being queryable, but rather enumerable (see https://github.com/npgsql/efcore.pg/issues/3001).

Instead, the work would be done in translation phase. This is good because:\r\n- nav expansion is located in core without means of extending it for provider specific functionality (see the hack we added for temporal tables - `NavigationExpansionExtensibilityHelper`),\r\n- during translation we have more information about the query that's being processed (e.g. we know which functions are translatable and which should be client-evaled),\r\n- some of the processing can potentially be streamlined, e.g we process includes right away (add JOIN and generate final client projection), rather than converting them to LeftJoin and then processing that again.\r\n\r\nOn the flipside, translation phase is already very complex, and this will add even more complexity, UNLESS some things can be simplified.\r\nAlso, nav expansion currently is is performing other tasks, e.g. reasons about primitive collections - this is because it's the only place in pre-processing where we have access to the model. So all preprocessing needing model information is performed there. \r\n\r\nWe either need to keep some pre-processing based on model where all those tasks can be performed (and maybe make it extensible for providers?) or move some of that to translation. @roji ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32957/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32957/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-12T08:06:46Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T08:06:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33290","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33290/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33290/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33290/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33290","id":2180231835,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPaMMs6B87Kb","number":33290,"title":"ExecuteUpdate fails when assigning a bool based on Any()","user":{"login":"WhatzGames","id":9288008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODgwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9288008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames","html_url":"https://github.com/WhatzGames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhatzGames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":936619505,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MzY2MTk1MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/labels/customer-reported","name":"customer-reported","color":"a4a5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-03-11T21:04:42Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T08:51:18Z","closed_at":"2024-03-12T09:29:19Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":16157746,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE1Nzc0Ng==","name":"efcore","full_name":"dotnet/efcore","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dotnet","id":9141961,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkxNDE5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotnet/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore","description":"EF Core is a modern object-database mapper for .NET.

Issue description\nWhen using `ExecuteUpdateAsync` to update a complex property's value, the operation fails if the `DbSet` has been filtered with a `.Where` predicate that requires a (slightly complicated?) JOIN to be performed.  \nThe relevant part of the error is `The following lambda argument to 'SetProperty' does not represent a valid property to be set`.  \n(Sample code and relevant stack trace provided below this description chapter.)\n\nI believe this must be an Npgsql-specific issue, because I also tried this with MS SQL server, and the update succeeded without errors there.\n\nIf at least one of the following is true, the error doesn't occur:\n- The `.Where` filter is simpler, for example `.Where(v => v.Id == 1)` or `.Where(v => v.Comments.Any())`\n- The property being updated isn't part of a complex property.\n\n## Minimal reproduction\n### Program.cs\n```C#\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\n\nvar optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<AppDbContext>();\noptionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(\"User ID=postgres;Password=postgres;Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=experiments;Include Error Detail=true\");\nawait using var dbContext = new AppDbContext(optionsBuilder.Options);\nawait dbContext.Database.EnsureDeletedAsync();\nawait dbContext.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();\n\nvar video = new Video\n{\n    Title = new TextTranslationKey\n    {\n        TextTranslations =\n        [\n            new TextTranslation\n            {\n                Locale = \"en-US\",\n                Content = \"Example title\",\n            },\n        ],\n    },\n};\ndbContext.Videos.Add(video);\nawait dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();\n\nawait dbContext.Videos\n    // Removing this WHERE or using a different, simpler WHERE (e.g. .Where(v => v.Id == 1)) works fine\n    .Where(v => v.Title!.TextTranslations!.Any())\n    .ExecuteUpdateAsync(x => x.SetProperty(v => v.Settings.IsMonitored, false));\n\npublic class Video\n{\n    public int Id { get; init; }\n    public TextTranslationKey?
