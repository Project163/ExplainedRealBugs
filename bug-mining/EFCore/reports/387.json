is not how any other Update methods on SqlExpression work. We should figure out if it was intentional and if it's safe to make changes. This may cause functional changes because Equals method on SelectExpression is (intentionally) implemented as ReferenceEquals. We could be missing some optimizations by \"updating\" the same SelectExpression in effect creating a copy, that we can't recognize as being equivalent anymore.
