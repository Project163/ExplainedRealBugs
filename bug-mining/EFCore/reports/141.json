experiencing strange behavior using EF 7 with the generated SQL to perform the insert on database.\r\n\r\nWhen I go to save a series of tables through SaveChanges two records of a table are not inserted in the SQL Server database.\r\nFrom my first analysis it seems that the problem occurs when there is a consistent number of records to insert for the same table so that the SQL generated by EF 7 is broken into different inserts.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing with SQL Server Profiler I found that two of these inserts are not created correctly in the SQL generated by EF 7\r\ntherefore only 64 records are inserted on 66 entities of type veDocumenti_Righe\r\n\r\nI have attached the detail of the DbContext before the SaveChanges where you can see that there are all 66 entities in the state of Added\r\n\r\nHowever, analyzing the generated SQL code, I saw that for the two rows that are not actually inserted, the insert statement in the database is missing.\r\nIf you analyze the sql code that I attached in the SQLInsert01.sql file you will see that for example the @p2165 parameter is declared and valued correctly but is not then used in the insert\r\n\r\nI await your kind feedback\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n### Provider and version information\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 7.0\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework: .NET 7.0\r\nOperating system:
