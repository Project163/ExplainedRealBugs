of the issue is that the SelectMany lambda is visited by the top-level QueryableMethodTranslatingExpressionVisitor - not by a subquery visitor. Our code for identifying the property access (b.Tags) kicks in only after the regular translation failed ([code](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore.Relational/Query/RelationalQueryableMethodTranslatingExpressionVisitor.cs#L268)); but the base visitation throws before that when translation fails on a non-subquery visitor ([code](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore/Query/QueryableMethodTranslatingExpressionVisitor.cs#L520)).","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32505/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
