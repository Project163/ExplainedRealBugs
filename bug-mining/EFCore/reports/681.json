Bug description\n\nWhile investigating an issue with some creation and update of entries in the single transaction we encountered the exception with the following part of StackTrace:\n\n```\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Update.Internal.CommandBatchPreparer.FormatValues(Object[] values, IReadOnlyList1 columns, IReadOnlyModificationCommand dependentCommand, StringBuilder builder)\n```\n\nBy debugging we found out that this line in EF Core 8 and 9:\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore.Relational/Update/Internal/CommandBatchPreparer.cs#L624\n\ncauses the hiding of real error, since for our case the `values` were Null, hiding the real error which was:\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Unable to save changes because a circular dependency was detected in the data to be saved: 'XXX [Added] ForeignKeyConstraint { 'uuu' } <-\nXXX [Modified] <-\nIndex { 'yyy' } PriceVariation [Added]To show additional information call 'DbContextOptionsBuilder.EnableSensitiveDataLogging'.'.\n```\n\n \n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\nI
