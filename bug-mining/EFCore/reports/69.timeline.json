statement, and `@params`, which contains the definition of all parameters passed in `@stmt`. \r\n\r\nLooking at the code in

In the end, `DbContext#SaveChangesAsync` is called once, which always worked fine. \r\nUsing the EF7 preview (7.0.0-preview.3.22175.1) however, `SaveChangesAsync` throws a `DbUpdateException` saying \"The incoming request has too many parameters\". Since no queries are constructed manually I have no Idea where the problem on my side could be. \r\nI suspected some problem with batchin and dug into ef itself. What I found is, that some of the batches created by `RelationalDependencies.BatchPreparer.BatchCommands(...)` in `RelationalDatabase#SaveChangesAsync` some of the commands have way more than the allowed 2100 parameters (defined by the azure database?). As far as I can tell all of those commands (ReaderModificationCommandBatch#StoreCommand) look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMERGE [Table1] USING (\r\nVALUES (@px, @py, .....)\r\n....;\r\nMERGE [Table2] USING (\r\nVALUES (@pz, @pw, .....)\r\n....;\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e., consist of multiple MERGE commands with a total of 2500 parameters or more.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I'm doing wrong with

The fix here is to move parameter adding to when the bulk insert command is added, just like any normal command; only the SQL addition is deferred.\r\n\r\nNote that this won't support fancy bulk strategies, such as a single array parameter for multiple rows in PostgreSQL.
