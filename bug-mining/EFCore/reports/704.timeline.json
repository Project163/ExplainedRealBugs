Above it was a \"string\" being defined as a \"decimal\" in my case it was a \"string\" defined as a \"uniqueidentifier\"\n3. best advise is to search your solution/project for the text : \"[Column(TypeName =\" and go through each model property you find and confirm if the TypeName make sense for the property type (for example varchar for string and so on)\n4.  Also update your migration after you fixed your column definitions\n\n\nI please beg the EFCore development team to look into if this happens that it logs explicitly what c# property and/or column causes the null reference for faster debugging and solution finding.\n\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2473765711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AloisNetgen","id":106516726,"node_id":"U_kgDOBllQ9g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106516726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen","html_url":"https://github.com/AloisNetgen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AloisNetgen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15480883567,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAPaMMs6GDX3JzwAAAAOau4lv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15480883567","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-30T11:39:45Z","rename":{"from":"Error
