For example, consider this table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE [Members] (\r\n    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,\r\n    [Name] nvarchar(max) NULL,\r\n    [IsActive] bit NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST(1 AS bit),\r\n    CONSTRAINT [PK_Member] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF8 now parses literal values in column default constraints, allowing `HasDefaultValue` to be scaffolded instead of `HasDefaultValyeSql`. For example, `CAST(1 AS bit)` is parsed as `true`:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Member>(entity =>\r\n{\r\n    entity.Property(e => e.IsActive).HasDefaultValue(true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF checks the value of a property to determine whether or not to let the database generate a value. Starting with EF8, [this check can be customized](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/701). This means that EF8 will send `false` to the database when needed, since database default is known to be `true`. \r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n- Major progress on value objects with the merge of [_Add complex types to Metadata_](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31003).\r\n- A PR with changes to JSON serialization is [out for review](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31160)\r\n- Unfortunately, the [T4 tooling changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/plan#first-class-t4-templates-in-visual-studio) planned for Visual Studio have been cut.\r\n\r\n## EF Core 8 (EF8)\r\n\r\nEF Core 8 (EF8) will be the next release after EF Core 7.0.
