This makes it impossible to extend the logic in providers.\r\n\r\nAs an example, during translation we currently create a SQL Server OPENWITH/WITH expression, with an ordering to preserve the JSON array's natural ordering. We then have a post-processing visitor which detects if the ordering is still there, and replaces OPENWITH/WITH with OPENWITH without WITH (since OPENWITH/WITH doesn't support natural ordering). A better design here would be to create the ordered version (without WITH), and when ClearOrderings is called (e.g. because IN/EXISTS/COUNT are applied), transform the OPENWITH at that point.\r\n\r\nBut since ClearOrderings() is a SelectExpression API, we cannot override it and add this SQL Server-specific logic. If the ClearOrderings() logic were moved to RelationalQueryableMethodTranslatingEV, we could - but that would also require moving out all SelectExpression logic which depends on it (e.g. ApplyDistinct). We'd need to very carefully consider SelectExpression's private state, and whether that remains on SelectExpression (with specific APIs to manipulate it), or whether it moves to the visitor as well.\r\n\r\nNote that we have other examples where we visit the query tree in pre-processing - we ideally shouldn't need to do that, but rather perform the function as part of translation.\r\n\r\nWork:\r\n\r\n* [x] #32674: moved out the \"removable joins list\".\r\n* [x] #32817: moved out all pruning logic to the pruning visitor. \r\n* [x] #32812: removed TableReferenceExpression and the private list tracking it.

While this works well, if you try to change columns on a non-main (split) table on SQL Server, this fails (see test NonSharedModelBulkUpdatesTestBase.Update_single_table_in_entity_with_entity_splitting); - this does work on SQLite, due to a different query shape.\r\n\r\nThe root cause here is that we generate an INNER JOIN between the main table and the split table, where the split table is the one being updated. When we prune the expression after translation (SelectExpressionPruningExpressionVisitor), we don't find any reference to the joined table **within the SelectExpression**: the only references are from the UpdateExpression's column setters, but the pruning visitor doesn't see them.\r\n\r\nThe proper fix here would be to make pruning a proper visitor, with specific handling for ExecuteUpdate. More generally, we should consider not having UpdateExpression be a wrapper around SelectExpression, but its own expression type that directly contains its elements. This may involve significant work as all postprocessing visitors would need to handle it properly, but it's the more correct representation and would prevent bugs like this from the get-go.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n* [#31083](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31083), which is related (pruning also doesn't visit all SelectExpressions since it isn't a real visitor).\r\n* [#31049](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31049#issuecomment-1592948285), which is about extracting the visitation out of SelectExpression so that providers can extend for provider-specific expressions (such as OPENJSON).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/31407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-25T07:22:33Z","updated_at":"2023-12-25T07:22:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32668","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32668/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32668/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32668/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32668","id":2055464527,"node_id":"I_kwDOAPaMMs56g-ZP","number":32668,"title":"Prune

This had several disadvantages, e.g. not pruning in subqueries which aren't tables, and not allowing the pruning mechanism to be extended by providers.\r\n\t* It was also based on a separate pass for finding which columns are referenced on which table (ColumnExpressionFindingExpressionVisitor); this was done for each select as we recursed down, revisiting the same nested nodes again and again.\r\n* This rewrite does the following:\r\n\t* Replace SelectExpressionPruningExpressionVisitor with SqlTreePruner, which is a real visitor that visits everywhere, pruning places we didn't prune before.\r\n\t* This also means it can be extended by providers (e.g. OPENJSON pruning, [#32668](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32668)).\r\n\t* The visitor is implemented as a single pass, both discovering column references and performing the actual pruning (better performance).\r\n* Note that pruning still mutates the SelectExpression rather than creating an immutable copy, as before. I did this mainly because that's how things currently work, and changing that would mean wider changes.\r\n\t* Specifically, if there are multi-referenced selects, TableAliasVerifyingExpressionVisitor (which comes right afterwards) has logic for handling that; but if pruning duplicates the multi-referenced select, we end up with two different select instances in the tree with the same alias, tripping up assertions (see similarity with [this problem](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32234#issuecomment-1806153111)).\r\n\t* We should revisit all of this after removing multi-referenced selects, which would be part of [#32277](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32277).\r\n\r\n@ajcvickers you may be interested in taking a look, this is query stuff but relatively scoped to a specific problem etc.\r\n\r\nTwo additional pruning-related PRs also coming up based on this one.\r\n\r\nCloses #31083\r\nFixes
