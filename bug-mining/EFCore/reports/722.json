Bug description\n\ncode below is not thread safe and leads to multiple CosmosClients created\n```csharp\ndbContext.Database.GetCosmosClient();\n```\n\nMultiple clients created leads to constant resource fighting between clients and 100% CPU on a client which quickly leads to 503 errros and service down:\n```\nResponse status code does not indicate success: ServiceUnavailable (503); \nSubstatus: 20005; \nReason: (The request failed because the client was unable to establish connections to 1 endpoints across 1 regions. \nThe client CPU has thread starvation.\n```\n\nAt first we reproduced in our changefeeds where we were doing batch Patch operations. Our service was using 100% CPU and spit 503s non-stop\n\nAfter checking CosmosDiagnostic I found 27 active CosmosClients:\n```\n            \"NumberOfClientsCreated\": 27,\n            \"NumberOfActiveClients\": 27,\n            \"ConnectionMode\": \"Direct\",\n            \"User Agent\": \"cosmos-netstandard-sdk/3.52.0|1|X64|Microsoft Windows 10.0.26100|.NET 8.0.19|N|\",\n            \"ConnectionConfig\": {\n                \"gw\": \"(cps:50, urto:6, p:False, httpf: False)\",\n                \"rntbd\": \"(cto: 5, icto: -1, mrpc: 30, mcpe: 65535, erd: True, pr: ReuseUnicastPort)\",\n                \"other\": \"(ed:False, be:False)\"\n            },\n```\n\nThen I patched it locally with static lock object\n<img width=\"1351\" height=\"296\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3424e336-942c-4978-99f2-f5beb74d469a\" />\n\nWhich actually helped!\n\nSo then I constructed a simple test to reproduce the problem:\n```csharp\npublic static T GetStaticField<T>(Type t, string name)\n    {\n        const BindingFlags flags =\n            BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Public;\n\n        var field = t.GetField(name, flags)\n            ?? throw new MissingFieldException(t.FullName, name);\n\n        return (T)field.GetValue(null)!;\n    }\n    \n    [TestMethod]\n    public void Foo()\n    {\n        var services = new ServiceCollection();\n        services.AddDbContextFactory<AnyContext>(options =>\n        {\n            options\n                .UseCosmos(\n                    connectionString,\n                    databaseName: dbName\n                )\n                .UseQueryTrackingBehavior(QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking)\n                .EnableDetailedErrors();\n            services.AddSingleton(options);\n        });\n        \n        var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();\n\n        var tasks = new List<Task>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)\n        {\n            tasks.Add(DoWork());\n        }\n        Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());\n        \n        int created = GetStaticField<int>(typeof(CosmosClient), \"numberOfClientsCreated\");\n        int active  = GetStaticField<int>(typeof(CosmosClient), \"NumberOfActiveClients\");\n        Console.WriteLine($\"created={created} active={active}\");\n        return;\n\n        async Task DoWork()\n        {\n            await Task.Yield();\n            var fac = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IDbContextFactory<AnyContext>>();\n            await using var ctx = await fac.CreateDbContextAsync();\n            // await using var ctx = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<AnyContext>();\n            var client = ctx.Database.GetCosmosClient();\n            var container = client.GetContainer(dbName, containerName);\n            try\n            {\n                var item = await container.ReadItemAsync<AnyModel>(\"anyId\",\n                    new PartitionKey(\"AnyPartition\"));\n                Console.WriteLine(item.ToString());\n            }\n            catch\n            {\n                // ignored\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nAnd on my machine that immediately returned:\n`created=32 active=32`\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\nN/A\n```\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### Verbose output\n\n```text\n\n```\n\n### EF Core version\n\n9.0.8\n\n### Database provider\n\nCosmosDb\n\n### Target framework\n\n.NET 8\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 11\n\n### IDE\n\nRider","closed_by":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36714/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36714/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
