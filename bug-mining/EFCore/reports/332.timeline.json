This bubbles up the tree, and then gets inferred and applied to the columns coming out of the OPENJSON expression. I'm pretty sure we already have other bugs because of this.\r\n\r\nThe correct fix here would be to improve our type inference logic, so that instead of just taking the left mapping we'd combine the two (opened #32333). We may also be able to do something more narrowly-targeted that would make sense in a
