However, the synthetic parameter names contained the name of the parameter and the name of the final (non-complex property), but did not contain the names of intermediate nested complex types containing the property. As a result, if a complex type contains two properties with the same name within different nested complex types, the same parameter name is generated and the old parameter is overridden.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nWhen doing complex type comparison against a parameter, where multiple nested properties have the same name, an incorrect query is generated, leading either to an error or two data corruption (incorrect results being returned).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nCustomer reported on 8.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\nNo, complex type support is a new feature in EF8.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nTest added.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nVery Low. The fix is very localized and straightforward - we simply add nested property names when constructing the parameter name. A quirk was added just in case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33548/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12675636045,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs6EN8GZzwAAAALzhttN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/12675636045","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ea5724dbb5048013a0eac7ae4e859befd2841227","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/ea5724dbb5048013a0eac7ae4e859befd2841227","created_at":"2024-05-01T22:32:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12675647602,"node_id":"DEME_lADOAPaMMs6EN8GZzwAAAALzhwhy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/12675647602","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-01T22:34:43Z","milestone":{"title":"9.0.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12675647607,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAPaMMs6EN8GZzwAAAALzhwh3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/12675647607","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-01T22:34:43Z","milestone":{"title":"8.0.6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12675648985,"node_id":"CE_lADOAPaMMs6EN8GZzwAAAALzhw3Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/12675648985","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/

For preview 4, these include:\n\n- Role-based access control (RBAC) is supported by EF9 for both management and use of containers.\n- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL does not support synchronous (blocking) access from application code. EF Core now blocks synchronous access by default, helping people fall into the pit-of-success of using async I/O.\n- Cosmos primitive collection support has been updated to use the metadata and model building APIs from EF8\n\nSee [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#cosmos) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## GroupBy complex types\n\nIn preview 4, EF9 now supports grouping (`GroupBy` queries) that group by a complex type instance. The resulting SQL uses groups by all members, reflecting the value object semantics of complex types.\n\nSee [GroupBy complex types](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#groupby-complex-types) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Read-only primitive collections\n\nEF8 introduced support for mapping arrays and mutable lists of primitive types. This has been expanded in EF9 to include read-only collections declared as `IReadOnlyList`, `IReadOnlyCollection`, or `ReadOnlyCollection`.\n\nSee [Read-only primitive collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#read-only-primitives) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n## Everything else in preview 4\n\nPreview 4 contains:\n\n- [10 enhancements](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-enhancement+)\n- [15 bug fixes](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A9.0.0-preview4+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug)\n\nEF Core 9 preview 4 (and Microsoft.Data.Sqlite) contains work from the EF Team at Microsoft (@​roji @​AndriySvyryd @​maumar @​ajcvickers @​cincuranet @​SamMonoRT @​luisquintanilla) as well as contributions from the EF Core community.

To discuss the EF9 release, go to [Try EF Core 9 now!](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33030) on GitHub.\n\n### Auto-compiled models\n\nAuto-compiled models allow the [EF Core compiled model](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics#compiled-models) to be automatically regenerated when the model project is built. This means you no longer need to remember to re-run the `dotnet ef dbcontext optimize` command after your EF model changes. See [Auto-compiled models](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew#auto-compiled-models) in the _What's New_ docs for more information.\n\n### Sugar for `HierarchyId` path generation\n\nFirst class support for the SQL Server `HierarchyId` type was [added in EF8](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/providers/sql-server/hierarchyid). In EF9, a sugar method has been added to make it easier to create new child nodes in the tree structure.
