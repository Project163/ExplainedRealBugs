Since the prefix is no longer needed for EF's purposes, it can be removed, simplifying our parameter names.\n\nWe can also take this opportunity to make some other simplifications. For example, we append a running counter to parameter names in case the same name is used twice - an exceedingly rare situation. We can append the number only for that case, leading to most parameters being named more naturally

Namely, it expects the parameter lists of the two given lambdas to be identical in number, type, and order; and then maps each parameter in lambda \"a\" to its counterpart **_with the same index/position_** in lambda \"b\" for later equality checks; meaning it's effectively doing something synonymous with what is now being done in `GetHashCode`:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/07284acdabd3ae4bdeca11ba2777a42ee6fec8bd/src/EFCore/Query/ExpressionEqualityComparer.cs#L393-L422\r\n\r\nThat said, we still do **fall back** to the parameter name in cases where the expression passed to `GetHashCode` is not a full lambda (i.e. say only `someLambda.Body`), because we have to. This is, once again, precisely what happens in `Equals` as well; specifically here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/07284acdabd3ae4bdeca11ba2777a42ee6fec8bd/src/EFCore/Query/ExpressionEqualityComparer.cs#L471\r\n\r\nThis is my very first time contributing to EF so feel free to let me know if I've made any mistakes.\r\n\r\nA few things:\r\n- I noticed that (at least) in the `ExpressionEqualityComparer`, `for` loops seem to have been preferred to `foreach` loops even when the latter could've also been used. I'm not sure why. I went with `foreach` in this newly-added code because the logic of the loop is dead simple. But let me know if this somehow matters and you want a `for` instead.\r\n- I'm not sure if I should add a test for this. It doesn't seem like a substantial enough change in my estimation. But let me know if I should.\r\n- One small thing I noticed (which is functionally inconsequential as far as I can tell but semantically weird) is the fact that in the `CompareParameter` method shown below, you're doing `mapped.Name == b`, as opposed to just `mapped == b`, while the latter would work too and is what actually makes sense — should I fix this too?\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/07284acdabd3ae4bdeca11ba2777a42ee6fec8bd/src/EFCore/Query/ExpressionEqualityComparer.cs#L469-L470\r\n---\r\n- [x] I've read the guidelines for [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and seen the [walkthrough](https://youtu.be/9OMxy1wal1s?t=1869)\r\n- [x] I've posted a comment on an issue with a detailed description of how I am planning to

Currently, we have to remember to call DoNotCache() in e.g. SqlNullabilityProcessor - this is error-prone, and if we forget this it can have subtle, hard-to-detect effects.\n\nInstead of exposing the parameters directly, we should expose a façade wrapping the parameter dictionary which:\n1. Allows checking if a given parameter is null (no problem there)\n2. Allows getting the full dictionary, but disables caching automatically as part of that.\n\nThis would ensure that anyone getting the parameters implicitly causes caching to be disabling, removing the possibility for this category of bugs.\n \nIn addition, do general clean up around the parameters dictionary, removing IParameterValues etc.. Components of the query pipeline up to the SQL cache which have access to parameters (e.g. funcletizer) should just be able to access the `Dictionary<string, object?>` directly - no need for a special API to get in the way.\n\nThis work on parameter handling in the query pipeline also goes well with #35089 which is also in 10.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36266/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
