I've removed the irrelevant parts of the query (that's always a good idea), here's a distlilled comparison of with and without DefaultIsEmpty for better understanding what's going on:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar withDefaultIfEmpty = context.TestEntities\r\n    .Select(x => x.Id)\r\n    .SelectMany(pk => context.TestEntities\r\n        .Where(entity => pk == entity.Id)\r\n        .SelectMany(\r\n            entity => context.TestEntities\r\n                .Where(a => a.Name.Contains(entity.Name))\r\n                .DefaultIfEmpty()));\r\nConsole.WriteLine(withDefaultIfEmpty.ToQueryString());\r\n\r\nvar withoutDefaultIfEmpty = context.TestEntities\r\n    .Select(x => x.Id)\r\n    .SelectMany(pk => context.TestEntities\r\n        .Where(entity => pk == entity.Id)\r\n        .SelectMany(\r\n            entity => context.TestEntities\r\n                .Where(a => a.Name.Contains(entity.Name))));\r\nConsole.WriteLine(withoutDefaultIfEmpty.ToQueryString());\r\n```\r\n\r\nSQLs:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT [s].[Id], [s].[Name], [s].[Parent]\r\nFROM [TestEntities] AS [t]\r\nLEFT JOIN (\r\n    SELECT [t2].[Id], [t2].[Name], [t2].[Parent], [t0].[Id] AS [Id0]\r\n    FROM [TestEntities] AS [t0]\r\n    CROSS APPLY (\r\n        SELECT [t1].[Id], [t1].[Name], [t1].[Parent]\r\n        FROM [TestEntities] AS [t1]\r\n        WHERE [t1].[Name] IS NOT NULL AND [t0].[Name] IS NOT NULL AND (CHARINDEX([t0].[Name], [t1].[Name]) > 0 OR [t0].[Name] LIKE N'')\r\n    ) AS [t2]\r\n) AS [s] ON [t].[Id] = [s].[Id0]\r\n\r\nSELECT [s].[Id], [s].[Name], [s].[Parent]\r\nFROM [TestEntities] AS [t]\r\nINNER JOIN (\r\n    SELECT [t2].[Id], [t2].[Name], [t2].[Parent], [t0].[Id] AS [Id0]\r\n    FROM [TestEntities] AS [t0]\r\n    CROSS APPLY (\r\n        SELECT [t1].[Id], [t1].[Name], [t1].[Parent]\r\n        FROM [TestEntities] AS [t1]\r\n        WHERE [t1].[Name] IS NOT NULL AND [t0].[Name] IS NOT NULL AND (CHARINDEX([t0].[Name], [t1].[Name]) > 0 OR [t0].[Name] LIKE N'')\r\n    ) AS [t2]\r\n) AS [s] ON [t].[Id] = [s].[Id0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, regarding why the outer join is a LEFT JOIN... The fragment inside the outer SelectMany() ends with a DefaultIsEmpty(); this means that for every outer ID, if there's no matching TestEntity, the query should return a null. If the outer query used a non-LEFT INNER JOIN, it would instead filter out any IDs with non-matching TestEntities, which would return wrong result (remember, EF always tries to produce the same results that a regular LINQ-to-Object query would produce).\r\n\r\nBut more generally, your usage of SelectMany() is slightly odd, and likely inefficient... Taking your original fragmentary query above:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nDbSet<MyRecord<long>>().FromSql(select * from unnest({0}), object[] { NpgsqlParameter<MyRecord<long>[]> })\r\n.SelectMany(pk => dataContext.TestItems\r\n    .Where(item => pk.Item == item.ParentId)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat you're looking for here seems to be a simple Contains query:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar ids = new[] { 1, 2, 3 };\r\n_ = context.TestEntities.Where(e => ids.Contains(e.Id))...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should make the EF provider produce better SQL, using the PG `ANY` operator, rather than using custom SQL with `unnest` and SelectMany(), which translates to costly extra joins.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2016428015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2017884544","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33343#issuecomment-2017884544","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33343","id":2017884544,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs54RnmA","user":{"login":"dombaigabor","id":53465528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDY1NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53465528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor","html_url":"https://github.com/dombaigabor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dombaigabor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-25T12:22:55Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T12:22:55Z","body":"We have the same issue with nested SelectMany (MSSQL, EF Core 7.0.5.). \r\n\r\n> Thanks for the repro.
