change makes the API consistency test methods in `ApiConsistencyTestBase` virtual, allowing database providers to override and customize the validation behavior for their specific needs.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n**Test Methods Made Virtual:**\n- `Fluent_api_methods_should_not_return_void`\n- `Generic_fluent_api_methods_should_return_generic_types`\n- `Builders_have_matching_methods`\n- `Metadata_types_have_expected_structure`\n- `Mutable_metadata_types_have_matching_methods`\n- `Convention_metadata_types_have_matching_methods`\n- `Convention_metadata_types_have_expected_methods`\n- `Convention_builder_types_have_expected_methods`\n- `Convention_builder_methods_have_matching_returns`\n- `Runtime_metadata_types_have_matching_methods`\n- `Readonly_metadata_methods_have_expected_name`\n- `Mutable_metadata_methods_have_expected_shape`\n- `Convention_metadata_methods_have_expected_shape`\n\n**Helper Methods Made Protected Virtual:**\n- `ValidateConventionBuilderMethodReturns`\n- `ValidateMetadata`\n- `ValidateConventionMethods`\n- `ValidateConventionBuilderMethods`\n- `ValidateMutableMethod`\n- `ValidateConventionMethod`\n- `MatchMutable`\n- `MatchConvention`\n- `MatchRuntime`\n\n## Benefits\n\nProviders can now customize API consistency validation by overriding specific test methods or helper methods. For example, a provider might need to:\n- Skip certain validation rules that don't apply to their architecture\n- Add provider-specific validation logic\n- Modify validation criteria for provider-specific API patterns\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\nThese changes are fully backward compatible. Existing provider tests will continue to work without modification, and providers can optionally override methods as needed.\n\nFixes #36521.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!
