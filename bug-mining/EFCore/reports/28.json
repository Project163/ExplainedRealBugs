discussed offline with @AndriySvyryd, ReaderModificationCommandBatch currently adds a parameter for each IColumnModification, for each modification command - in order.  This makes it difficult to implement patterns which do fancy things with parameters. For example, on PostgreSQL insertion of multiple rows can be optimized as follows:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO data_table (id, name) SELECT * FROM unnest(@i, @n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere @i and @n are array for the column values of the different rows.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think we can simplify the current design and apply commands to the batch directly as they're added, as opposed to the current CachedCommandText mechanism.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/27583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
