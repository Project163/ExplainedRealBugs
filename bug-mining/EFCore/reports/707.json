=> s.SetProperty(b => b.SomeJsonDocument.Foo, b => \"foo\");\n```\n\nThings get interesting when there are multiple updates inside the same JSON document:\n\n```c#\nctx.blogs.ExecuteUpdate(s => s\n    .SetProperty(b => b.SomeJsonDocument.Foo, b => \"foo\")\n    .SetProperty(b => b.SomeJsonDocument.Bar, b => \"bar\");\n```\n\nWe could apply the same logic we're discussing for SaveChanges:\n\n1. Do \"least-common-denominator\" to find the smallest branch containing all the properties to be updated.\n    *  This was discussed; unlike SaveChanges, with ExecuteUpdate the user expresses exactly what changes they want and how (it's a lower-level API). So rather than trying to guess whether a least-common-denominator is better than two point patches - a decision that EF isn't well-placed to make (it has no idea how big the properties typically are) - we'll just let the user write out the UPDATE statement they want via ExecuteUpdate.\n3. As a further optimization, nest multiple invocations (e.g. of JSON_MODIFY for SQL Server) to update the two properties; but we need to investigate and benchmark to know to what extent that makes sense and when.\n    * Most databases do not allow multiple updates of the same column in the same UPDATE statements (the UPDATE setters aren't imperative instructions executed one-by-one); so nesting multiple invocations wasn't optional.","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28766/reactions","total_count":28,"+1":28,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28766/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
