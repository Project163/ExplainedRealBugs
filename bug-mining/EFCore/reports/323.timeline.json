Adds translations for Math.Min/Max in non-aggregate context ([#27794](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/27794)), using the SQL Server 2022 LEAST/GREATEST functions.\r\n2. Adds EF.Functions.Least/Greatest at the relational level ([#31681](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31681)), to allow invoking them directly; this is for types which don't have Math.Min/Max overloads (dates, strings...), and also to specify arbitrary-length lists without having to nest Math.Min/Max invocations\r\n3. Pattern matches for Math.Min/Max over an inline primitive collection (`new[] { x, y }.Max()`), simplifying the translation via LEAST/GREATEST ([#32332](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32332)). This is done conditional on the SQL Server compatibility level.\r\n\r\nDesign notes:\r\n\r\n* ~LEAST/GREATEST require SQL Server 2022; when introducing the SQL Server compatibility level, we decided to make it 2022 by default. This means that this PR breaks users of older databases who don't have their compatibility level set explicitly (change 3 specifically). We may want to revisit the default.~ (revisited, changed to 2019)\r\n* In SQLite, EF.Functions.Least/Greatest translate to MIN/MAX, though we usually try to have EF.Functions method names correpond to the actual SQL function invoked. However, it's good to have these methods at the relational level, and all databases except for SQLite have LEAST/GREATEST.\r\n\r\nCloses #27794\r\nCloses #31681\r\nCloses
