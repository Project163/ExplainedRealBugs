File a bug\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon a bug in the `RelationalSqlTranslatingExpressionVisitor.CreatePropertyAccessExpression`\r\nI have a `.Where()` query comparing 2 ComplexProperties of a given type:\r\n\r\n## Repro-Repo\r\n\r\nI set up a repository to reproduce the error: https://github.com/lucahost/ef-complex-bug-repro\r\nJust adjust the connection string in `Program.cs` and run the sample.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n\r\nvar orderPosition = // load orderPosition\r\n\r\ndbContext.DbSet<Shipment>()\r\n  .Where(shipmnet => shipment.Recipient == orderPosition.Recipient)\r\n  .ToList();\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic record Recipient\r\n{\r\n    public required Address Address { get; init; }\r\n    public required Customer Customer { get; init; }\r\n    public required Person BuyerPerson { get; init; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic sealed record Address\r\n{\r\n    public required Id<Address> Id { get; init; }\r\n}\r\npublic sealed record Customer\r\n{\r\n    public required Id<Customer> Id { get; init; }\r\n}\r\npublic sealed record Person\r\n{\r\n    public required Id<Person> Id { get; init; }\r\n}\r\n\r\nbuilder.ComplexProperty(\r\n    shipment => shipment.Recipient,\r\n    complexPropertyBuilder =>\r\n    {\r\n        complexPropertyBuilder\r\n            .ComplexProperty(\r\n                recipient => recipient.Address,\r\n                addressBuilder => addressBuilder.Property(address => address.Id)\r\n                    .HasConversion<IdConverter<Address>>()\r\n                    .IsRequired())\r\n            .ComplexProperty(\r\n                recipient => recipient.Customer,\r\n                customerBuilder => customerBuilder.Property(customer => customer.Id)\r\n                    .HasConversion<IdConverter<Customer>>()\r\n                    .IsRequired())\r\n            .ComplexProperty(\r\n                recipient => recipient.BuyerPerson,\r\n                buyerPersonBuilder => buyerPersonBuilder.Property(person => person.Id)\r\n                    .HasConversion<IdConverter<Person>>()\r\n                    .IsRequired());\r\n    });\r\n\r\n// Same Mapping for OrderPosition\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow in the `RelationalSqlTranslatingExpressionVisitor` in `CreatePropertyAccessExpression` the SQL statements `parameterName` for `OrderPosition.Recipient.Address.Id` of Type `Id<Address>` is generated as following: `__entity_equality_orderPosition_Recipient_0_Id`\r\n\r\n## Exception in `RelationalTypeMapping.CreateParameter`\r\n\r\nThen in the conversion of the parameter to the provider, the wrong cast is being made.\r\nThe SQL-parameter `@__entity_equality_orderPosition_Recipient_0_Id` of type `Id<Customer>` would be converted to `Id<Address>`\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/assets/5907956/f7fa23e5-dfdc-441f-a8c0-792fc8c990ff)\r\n\r\n## Assumption\r\n\r\nAs you see, the `Id` property on the complex types are all called the same. I think this is the culprit which results in the parameter not being added correctly.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nOne workaround was to get rid of the nesting -> `OrderPosition.Recipient.AddressId` where `Recipient` is configured as `ComplexProperty()` and `AddresId` as `.Property()`.\r\n\r\nAnother one I found out while stepping through the code was by using a distinct parameter-name in `RelationalSqlTranslatingExpressionVisitor.CreatePropertyAccessExpression`. Something along the lines \r\n\r\n```c#\r\n// get generic class as propertyName\r\nvar propName = $\"{property.ClrType.GenericTypeArguments[0].Name}_{property.Name}\";\r\n\r\nvar newParameterName =\r\n    $\"{RuntimeParameterPrefix}\"\r\n    + $\"{sqlParameterExpression.Name[QueryCompilationContext.QueryParameterPrefix.Length..]}_{propName }\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater is not a solution for everything, but was working in my case.\r\nI think the parameter-name should be generated something like this: `__entity_equality_orderPosition_Recipient_0_Address_Id` including the nested properties name.\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 8.0.3\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework: .NET 8.0\r\nOperating system:\r\nIDE: Rider 2024.1 RC\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33449/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/33449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
