order to find the provider's JsonTypeMapping, our code currently does a standard lookup with CLR type JsonElement (as a sort of special value). The problem is that some provider's actually do support JsonElement as a real property CLR type; in addition, if a user defines a JsonElement property on some entity type, this type mapping will be return, and things will likely fail in some unpredictable way.\r\n\r\nWe should find another way to look up the JsonTypeMapping, e.g. define some special CLR type instead of JsonElement that could be used, or introduce a new API or something.\r\n\r\n/cc @maumar","closed_by":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32192/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
