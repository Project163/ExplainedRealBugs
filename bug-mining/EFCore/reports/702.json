Bug description\n\nI created inherit DbContexts to handle some tests, all works well using ef 8, but today I upgrade it to ef 9.0.1 and throws this error:\n\nSystem.Reflection.AmbiguousMatchException\nMultiple custom attributes of the same type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure.DbContextAttribute' found.\n   at System.Attribute.GetCustomAttribute(MemberInfo element, Type attributeType, Boolean inherit)\n   at System.Reflection.CustomAttributeExtensions.GetCustomAttribute[T](MemberInfo element)\n   at Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations.Internal.MigrationsAssembly.<get_ModelSnapshot>b__9_0(TypeInfo t)\n   ...\n\nMy suspect is that the MigrationsAssembly is getting all inherits attributes of type DbContextAttribute instead of taking only the one related to the actual class, I deleted the DbContextAttribute in generated migration partial class and all works ok again.\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\n// generated migration class\n\n[DbContext(typeof(MyDbContext))] // this is removed in order to works ok\n[Migration(\"FirstMigration\")]\npartial class FirstMigration // ...\n\n// my extended class\n\n[DbContext(typeof(MyDbContextExtended))]\n[Migration(\"FirstMigrationExtended\")]\nclass FirstMigrationExtended : FirstMigration // ... extra info added to the migration\n```\n\n### Stack traces\n\n```text\nSystem.Reflection.AmbiguousMatchException\nMultiple custom attributes of the same type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure.DbContextAttribute'
