This:\r\n\r\n* *NativeAOT*: this is (currently) a prerequisite to NativeAOT support, since we're not (yet) going to make query compilation NativeAOT-compatible (this may be done in 10 to support dynamic queries).\r\n* *Improve query runtime*: no more parameter extraction, cache lookup, etc. A bit similar to [compiled queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/performance/advanced-performance-topics?tabs=with-di%2Cexpression-api-with-constant#compiled-queries) but goes even further, and without requiring the user to use any special APIs. \r\n* *Reduced startup time*: no more EF query compilation.\r\n\r\nNote that although this is a prerequisite to NativeAOT support, precompiled queries can be used in non-NativeAOT applications to get the above performance benefits (faster execution and startup time).\r\n\r\nThe main subtasks are tracked on [the general NativeAOT epic](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29754).\r\n\r\n* [ ] Integrate precompilation into `dotnet publish`, and possibly also into `dotnet ef` for manual precompilation.\r\n    * Note that we'll need to be able to raise warnings from this step (e.g. some query failed compilation, or a dynamic query was detected), and to cause the publish to fail (warnings as errors).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n** PREVIOUS DESIGN THOUGHTS **\r\n\r\n## General design\r\n\r\nWhen a LINQ query is first encountered, EF \"compiles\" it, producing a code-generated shaper, SQL (for relational databases), etc. This process is both a bit long (increasing startup times), and incompatible with AOT environments (since code generation is used at runtime). While several approaches have been discussed in the past to improve this (e.g. #16496), with the advent of source generators we have some new possibilities. I've done some work on a proof-of-concept source generator which identifies EF queries and precompiles them; the work is far from complete but indicates that the approach is feasible.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, we would:\r\n\r\n1. Identify a query in user source code\r\n    * A first implementation would identify invocations of EF's compiled query API (EF.CompileQuery); this is trivial and low-risk way to immediately identify EF queries in the user's code.\r\n    * We could later also attempt to precompile regular queries which don't use EF.CompileQuery. This would be an additional step in which we identify DbSets (as member accesses on a DbContext-typed identfier), and then walk up the syntax tree, progressively including methods as long as they accept IQueryable. Once we reach a method which doesn't accept IQueryable (e.g. ToList), we've reached the end of the query to be compiled.\r\n    * Dynamically-constructed queries wouldn't be supported.\r\n2. Transform the query to a LINQ expression tree\r\n    * Once we have a Roslyn syntax tree representing a query (either from EF.CompileQuery or from a regular query), it needs to be transformed into a LINQ expression tree, which is what EF's query pipeline requires.\r\n    * Unlike the Roslyn structures, LINQ expression trees refer to actual .NET types, MemberInfos, etc. We would therefore need to load the user's assembly (from the input compilation given to the source generator), and use reflection to load actual types from it (e.g. entity CLR types). See note on AssemblyLoadContext below.\r\n3. Compile the query with EF Core\r\n    * Once we have a LINQ expression tree, we need to pass it to EF's query compiler. To do this:\r\n        * We instantiate the user's DbContext type, using the parameterless constructor\r\n        * Extract the IQueryCompiler service from it\r\n        * Invoke the compiler, passing it the LINQ expression tree.\r\n    * The output of this compilation is another LINQ expression tree, which instantiates e.g. a SingleQueryingEnumerable given a QueryContext. This output tree must not contain any compiled elements, e.g. the shaper must be present in non-compiled form. This would require some refactoring of the last parts of the query pipeline.\r\n4. Generate C# out of the compilation output\r\n    * In the normal flow, the output LINQ expression tree is now compiled to produce a lambda (returning e.g. an enumerable given a QueryContext).\r\n    * In the AOT flow, the expression tree would instead be outputted as C# code into a file emitted by the source generator. This generated code would be invoked by EF as part of startup, and would pre-populate its query cache.\r\n    * This would require writing a component to convert a LINQ expression tree to C# code - possibly passing through a Roslyn syntax tree for maximum flexibility etc..\r\n\r\nThe final code added by the source generator would look something like the following:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar selectExpression = ...;\r\n\r\nvar readColumns = ...;\r\n\r\nvar relationalCommandCache = new RelationalCommandCache(\r\n    memoryCache,\r\n    querySqlGeneratorFactory,\r\n    RelationalParameterBasedSqlProcessFactory,\r\n    selectExpression,\r\n    readColumns,\r\n    useRelationalNulls: false\r\n);\r\n\r\nvar shaper = ...;\r\n\r\nvar enumerable = new SingleQueryingEnumerable<Blog>(\r\n    (RelationalQueryContext)QueryCompilationContext.QueryContextParameter,\r\n    relationalCommandCache,\r\n    shaper,\r\n    typeof(Blog),\r\n    standAloneStateManager: false,\r\n    detailedErrorsEnabled: false,\r\n    threadSafetyChecksEnabled: true);\r\n\r\n// Pre-populate EF Core's cache with the above enumerable\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n\r\n* The above does not cover relational command caching (including SQL), which depends on parameter nullability. This means that some query compilation still remains at runtime (but no code generation).\r\n* We *may* be able to reuse previously-precompiled queries if their source file hasn't change (e.g. store file hashes). This would make this feature suitable also for speeding up the developer inner loop.\r\n* Query precompilation isn't necessarily dependent on using compiled models (#1906), though using that would speed the process up.\r\n* [This could be helpful](https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2018/07/25/netcore-plugins/) (thanks @bricelam)\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Following internal discussion it has become clear that doing this as a source generator isn't practical (see https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/25009#issuecomment-853735001 below). Instead, this would be a design-time CLI command or similar.\r\n\r\n* ~This would most likely be opt-in-only (via a csproj property), and probably makes most sense in Release builds.~\r\n* ~When loading user assemblies (and their dependents), we probably want to isolate them in their own AssemblyLoadContext. This isn't trivial - we need to take Roslyn-provided syntax tree and semantic models (default assembly loader), transform them into an expression tree, and pass that into the query pipeline isolated inside the special AssemblyLoadContext. In my prototype, the default AssemblyLoadContext is used to avoid these

However, we won't be able to always pre-generate the final SQL as a string; a single LINQ query may be the source of multiple SQL variations, mainly based on different null-ness of parameters included in it. If the number of premutations is small (up to a few nullable parameters), we should be able to pregenerate the final SQLs and stick them in the interceptor (that's #29753); but beyond a certain number of parameters that becomes too much. There are also cases where the SQL is totally dynamic, e.g. when we integrate actual parameter content into the SQL itself.\r\n\r\nSo in the general case, we need the interceptors to contain an expression representing the SQL, which would be the input for  runtime processing which produces the final SQL string (\"2nd part of the query pipeline\").

This PR is stacked on top of #33297 (review only the last commits).\r\n\r\nImplementation overview:\r\n\r\n* Instead of accepting a RelationalCommandCache (which wraps the 2nd part of the query pipeline), querying enumerables now accept a RelationalCommandResolver, which is a lambda reponsible for producing the relational command.\r\n    * In normal mode, the resolver references the RelationalCommandCache, so things work as before.\r\n    * For precompiled queries with 3 nullable parameters or less, the resolver lambda directly contains code which switches over the nullness of the nullable parameters, and returns captured, fully-built relational commands containing the final SQL string. Example:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar relationalCommandTemplate = ((IRelationalCommandTemplate)(new RelationalCommand(commandBuilderDependencies, \"SELECT [b].[Id], [b].[Name]\\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\\nWHERE 0 = 1\", new IRelationalParameter[] { })));\r\nvar relationalCommandTemplate0 = ((IRelationalCommandTemplate)(new RelationalCommand(commandBuilderDependencies, \"SELECT [b].[Id], [b].[Name]\\nFROM [Blogs] AS [b]\\nWHERE [b].[Id] = @__id_0\", new IRelationalParameter[] { new TypeMappedRelationalParameter(\"__id_0\", \"@__id_0\", relationalTypeMappingSource.FindMapping(typeof(int), \"int\", false, false, null, false, false, null, null), true, ParameterDirection.Input) })));\r\n\r\nSingleQueryingEnumerable.Create(((RelationalQueryContext)(queryContext)), (IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> parameters) =>\r\n{\r\n    IRelationalCommandTemplate result = default(IRelationalCommandTemplate);\r\n    if (parameters[\"__id_0\"] == null)\r\n    {\r\n        result = relationalCommandTemplate;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        result = relationalCommandTemplate0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return result;\r\n}, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* This PR also implements awareness of NRT captured variables, so that e.g. a non-nullable string parameter causes only one SQL to get generated (with that SQL being optimized for the non-nullable case), just like for value types:\r\n    * When translating the user's LINQ query from C# to LINQ, the captured variable is represented via an internal fake FieldInfo which contains the NRT information.\r\n    * The funcletizer checks for this information and reports it out, and we store the list of all non-nullable NRT parameters on QueryCompilationContext.\r\n    * When translating ParameterExpression to SqlParameterExpression in RelationalSqlTranslatingExpressionVisitor, we
