this issue tracks only fixing Contains. Other non-lambda operators (Skip, Take, ElementAt...) are tracked by #32312, to have two quirks for Contains and non-Contains.**\r\n\r\nWhen running test Nested_contains_with_Lists_and_no_inferred_type_mapping (introduced in #32214), which has the following code:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar ints = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };\r\nvar strings = new List<string> { \"one\", \"two\", \"three\" };\r\n\r\nreturn AssertQuery(\r\n    async,\r\n    ss => ss.Set<PrimitiveCollectionsEntity>().Where(e => strings.Contains(ints.Contains(e.Int) ? \"one\" : \"two\")));\r\n```\r\n\r\n... the query tree going into nav expansion is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDbSet<PrimitiveCollectionsEntity>()\r\n    .Where(e => __strings_0\r\n        .AsQueryable()\r\n        .Contains(__ints_1\r\n            .AsQueryable()\r\n            .Contains(e.Int) ? \"one\" : \"two\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n... whereas the tree coming out is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDbSet<PrimitiveCollectionsEntity>()\r\n    .Where(p => __strings_0\r\n        .Contains(__ints_1\r\n            .AsQueryable()\r\n            .Contains(p.Int) ? \"one\" : \"two\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the outer AsQueryable (over `__strings_0`) is gone, while the inner one (over `__ints_1`) remains.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening here is this... NavigationExpandingEV works recursively on lambda arguments of operators; [ProcessWhere](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore/Query/Internal/NavigationExpandingExpressionVisitor.cs#L1491) calls into ProcessLambdaExpression, which calls into ExpandNavigationsForSource which visits the the Where predicate. This causes the Where lambda to be fully processed by the visitor, and the AsQueryable wrapping `__strings_0` is removed.\r\n\r\nHowever, [ProcessContains ](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/src/EFCore/Query/Internal/NavigationExpandingExpressionVisitor.cs#L919) does not similarly recurse into the item argument of Contains; so the AsQueryable there isn't removed.\r\n\r\nNote that there may be other important functionality of nav expansion which is not performed here; and there are other operator aside from Contains which likely don't visit their non-lambda arguments. So there are probably other bugs hiding in here.\r\n\r\nWhen this is fixed, we can remove the unwrapping of AsQueryable() from the fallback Contains translation (see #32218).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32217/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
