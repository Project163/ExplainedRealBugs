we should do positional by default.\r\n  * Supporting named seems like it needs some metadata changes... StoredProcedureParameterBuilder has HasName (StoreStoredProcedureParameter extends IColumnBase which has Name). From a user perspective this looks like it should set the parameter name in the sproc call (e.g. `EXEC @id = 3, @name = 'foo'`). However, this is all non-nullable, so we have no way to make the named/positional distinction. Making IColumnBase.Name nullable seems like it would have a huge impact; another option would be to use some other property specific to StoreStoredProcedureParameter, but that would make Name dead for that type. We can also scope this out and say that named parameters aren't supported (and remove the HasName API for now).\r\n* Some assumptions in this implementation:\r\n  * We call sprocs from regular commands (CommandType.Text with EXEC), even with output parameters. The alterative is to use CommandType.StoredProcedure, but these can't be batched - one call per command (until the new ADO.NET batching API is implemented). This works well for SQL Server, but I'm not 100% sure of the portability here.\r\n  * We consume output parameters as we're traversing the DbCommand's result set. If some database only populates output parameters at the end (e.g. when the reader is disposed), this will fail.\r\n* No seeding support right now. I think this would require propagating the relational model through migrations - probably not trivial. Consider scoping out.\r\n* Sprocs don't have to return rows affected (but they can). This means that the concurrency check is optional - not possible without sprocs at the moment (see #10443).\r\n\r\nSome cross-database comparison:\r\n\r\nDatabase   | Syntax                       |

outputs from a discussion with @ajcvickers...\r\n\r\n### Problem 1\r\n\r\nFor the \"same command\" scenario, we're discussing writing the value when updating the entity, but also reading it back (if the property is ValueGeneratedOnUpdate).\r\n\r\nHowever, there's also the case of inserts; just like a sproc/trigger/whatever may change the incoming value for an UPDATE, it may do so for an INSERT. In other words, to be consistent here, we'd need to read back ValueGeneratedOnAdd properties even when a value is provided by the user (since it may be modified db-side). We could start doing this, but that means we'd start sending back *all* IDs from the database even when they're explicitly given by the user, just to support this exotic scenario - which doesn't seem right.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the same is true of ValueGeneratedOnUpdate: the fact that a property is ValueGeneratedOnUpdate doesn't necessarily tell us if it's only generated/manipulated when no value is provided by the user, or *also* manipulated when the user provides a value. If we just start reading back values whenever the property is ValueGeneratedOnUpdate, we'd potentially be needlessly sending back values when we don't need to. This is admittedly really exotic, but there may be a case here for consistency with add.\r\n\r\nIn other words, to implement this we may be lacking additional metadata, which tells us to read back the property value on insert/update even when the user provides it.\r\n\r\n### Problem 2\r\n\r\nFor the non-same-command scenario, i.e. just allow the value to be either written or read (in different commands), there's still a problem with sprocs. Unlike regular SQL, sprocs require us to always provide all the parameters, making it difficult to do optional parameters (i.e. you can provide the value, but if you don't it'll get generated). The user could tell us about a sentinel value which we'd set when a property isn't set/changed by the user, and write their sprocs to recognize that value and act accordingly. Or there could be another flag parameter to say whether the parameter is set or not. But these seem like quite advanced features which we probably don't want to include for 7.0.\r\n\r\nI'll bring this back to design, @AndriySvyryd if I've completely misunderstood things let me know.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1219698203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7215867137,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5Pv7F6zwAAAAGuGWUB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/7215867137","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-18T16:30:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7215867145,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs5Pv7F6zwAAAAGuGWUJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/7215867145","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-18T16:30:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7215869215,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5Pv7F6zwAAAAGuGW0f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/7215869215","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-18T16:30:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7215869231,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs5Pv7F6zwAAAAGuGW0v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/ev

This PR makes in/out parameters means \"always both send and receive\", as discussed. If, in the future, we implement optional sproc parameters with sentinel values, it would be a breaking change to change the meaning of in/out to \"write only if the user set the property, read only if they didn't\" (which is our regular SQL behavior). In other words, in order to allow the user to *sometimes* provide a value and sometimes not (in different commands) - today, without optional params/sentinels - we're making it so that their value is *always* sent and read back (in the same command).\r\n\r\nI'm a bit concerned that we're painting ourselves into a corner; ideally, the write-and-read within the same command would be triggered by a separate opt-in, since it's probably really rare. Not merging this PR would mean users currently must choose either input or output, but not both, which doesn't seem too bad. If/when we have optional/sentinel parameters, they'd be able to do input/output without reading back values when they provide them.\r\n\r\nBut we've already discussed this too much...
