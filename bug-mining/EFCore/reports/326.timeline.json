a similar issue while adding a new migration after altering a column **name** or **adding** a new column.\r\nSteps are similar to @siby-george's:\r\n\r\n1.

Generate migration script.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nOriginal entity looked like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class ExonerationDetermination : AuditEntity\r\n  {\r\n      public long Id { get; set; }\r\n      public string Determination { get; set; }\r\n      public string Reason { get; set; }\r\n      public string Comments { get; set; }\r\n      public virtual User CreatedByUser { get; set; }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter modification:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class ExonerationDetermination : AuditEntity\r\n  {\r\n      public long Id { get; set; }\r\n      public string Determination { get; set; }\r\n      public string Reason { get; set; }\r\n      public string AdditionalComments { get; set; } // Modified\r\n      public virtual User CreatedByUser { get; set; }\r\n      public string PreviousStatus { get; set; } // Added\r\n      public string NewStatus { get; set; } // Added\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nGenerate migration with command:\r\n\r\n`dotnet ef migrations add ExonerationRequests`\r\n\r\nWhen building and starting the project, the following error is displayed on the output window:\r\n\r\n `Setting SYSTEM_VERSIONING to ON failed because table 'PEJC.exoneration.Determination' has 14 columns and table 'PEJC.exoneration.DeterminationHistory' has 11 columns.`\r\n\r\nThe three columns that are missing from the table 'PEJC.exoneration.DeterminationHistory' are precisely the ones we added/modified.

the entity, then turn versioning back on. \r\n\r\n### Additional Info\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 6.0.9\r\nDatabase provider: SQL Server\r\nTarget framework: .NET 6\r\nOperating system: Windows\r\nIDE:

so.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1301593442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"James-Jackson-South","id":40586059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg2MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40586059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South","html_url":"https://github.com/James-Jackson-South","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7728591752,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5IEMfYzwAAAAHMqPOI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/7728591752","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-03T03:09:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7728591756,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs5IEMfYzwAAAAHMqPOM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/7728591756","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-03T03:09:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7728591764,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs5IEMfYzwAAAAHMqPOU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/7728591764","actor":{"login":"James-Jackson-South","id":40586059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg2MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40586059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South","html_url":"https://github.com/James-Jackson-South","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/James-Jackson-South/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public",

After all is done we re-enable versioning. Historical information on the computed column will be copied to the counterpart column in history table without issue.\r\n\r\nOne thing that we can't do is modifying computed column SQL when table is temporal. What happens in case of CCSQL modification, we drop the column and create a new one with new CCSQL. This is not an issue for regular table, because the value is computed anyway, so old value is useless. But when we drop-create column, that column gets created at the last position in the table, and so the table no longer matches it's history table exactly (positions of columns may differ). We would have to drop+recreate column on a history table, but that results in losing historical data of that column. And that is valuable data, unlike for regular table. We could enable that scenario once/if we support table rebuilds.\r\n\r\nFixes #27844","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11044400481,"node_id":"DEME_lADOAPaMMs5IEMfYzwAAAAKSTC1h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11044400481","actor":{"login":"maumar","id":1591930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar","html_url":"https://github.com/maumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-23T08:22:43Z","milestone":{"title":"Backlog"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
