Although EF Core 5.0 was never officially trimming-compatible, at least basic scenarios were possible.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nCoverage will be added in 7.0, where trimming will be a focus. The fix was verified manually.\r\n\r\nNote that EF Core 6.0 still won't be fully trimming-compatible, but this unlocks at least the basic scenarios which customers were asking for.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nVery low - the fix only adds an attribute which is meaningful only to the linker.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThis uses the [DynamicDependency] attribute to make sure System.Math isn't trimmed when using EF Core.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure why System.Math is special here - we have other translators which depend on various other things (string, GUID), but with this attribute all SQL Server method/member translators initialize successfully and the query executes.\r\n\r\nI've placed the attribute in IMethodCallTranslator to fix this for all providers, rather than requiring every provider to do this (since everyone translates stuff on Math).\r\n\r\nFixes
