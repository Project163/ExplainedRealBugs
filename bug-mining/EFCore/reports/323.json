Math.Max / Math.Min is not being translated for SQL Server - only for sqlite as introduced in #10533\r\n\r\nTransact-SQL does not have an MIN or MAX function, so there's no 1-to-1 mapping, but it is however possible to translate it into a `CASE WHEN` statement.\r\nFor example\r\n```csharp\r\nMath.Max(Column1, Column2)\r\n```\r\nis equivalent to\r\n```SQL\r\nCASE\r\n    WHEN Column1 >= Column2 THEN Column1\r\n    ELSE Column2\r\nEND\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion, I made a reference implementation by adding the following translation to `SqlServerMathTranslator.cs`\r\n\r\nFor Math.Max it looks like this:\r\n```csharp\r\nvar left = arguments[0];\r\nvar right = arguments[1];\r\n\r\nvar typeMapping = ExpressionExtensions.InferTypeMapping(left, right);\r\nleft = _sqlExpressionFactory.ApplyTypeMapping(left, typeMapping);\r\nright = _sqlExpressionFactory.ApplyTypeMapping(right, typeMapping);\r\n\r\nreturn _sqlExpressionFactory.Case(\r\n    new[] { new CaseWhenClause(_sqlExpressionFactory.GreaterThanOrEqual(left, right), left) },\r\n    right);\r\n```\r\nand Math.Min:\r\n```csharp\r\n// same type mapping...\r\nreturn _sqlExpressionFactory.Case(\r\n    new[] { new CaseWhenClause(_sqlExpressionFactory.LessThanOrEqual(left, right), left) },\r\n    right);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Link to my branch of the
