Seemingly caused by a regression in the translation of `Contains` in EfCore.

This is effectively what we used to do in 7.0 (before 8.0 changes, Contains used to be handled by `ProcessUnknownMethod` which visits all its arguments). For extra safety, added two separate quirks: one for Contains, which is a reported regression, and one for other methods that have exactly the same bug (Skip, Take, ElementAt) for which don't have a
