originally asked this question [here](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/795/#issuecomment-1232811784) but couldn't get a response, so I figured maybe I should create an issue for it. It's about the new `ExecuteUpdate` feature.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the `SetProperty` method doesn't accept an actual value (a string literal, for example) as its second argument, only an expression, so you'd have to do:\r\n```csharp\r\n.SetProperty(p => p.Name, _ => \"Shay\")\r\n```\r\nInstead of just:\r\n```csharp\r\n.SetProperty(p => p.Name, \"Shay\")\r\n```\r\nIs there a particular reason behind this?! Why don't you just allow simple values?","closed_by":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28968/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/28968/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
