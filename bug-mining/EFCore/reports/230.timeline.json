This is somewhat similar to GenerateNonNullSqlLiteral, but for values inside JSON. In simple cases (int, string), no special logic is needed; but in certain cases, we need to precisely control the representation. For example, a NetTopologySuite Geometry would likely need to be serialized as WKT, which isn't necessarily what ToString returns.\r\n\r\nNote the interaction between this issue and #30604, which is about switching to the lower-level Utf8JsonReader/Utf8JsonWriter APIs rather than passing through DOM. If/when we do that, the type mappings would be the ones calling specific APIs e.g. on Utf8JsonWriter.\r\n\r\n~In addition to serialization/deserialization, we also need a hook for perform a SQL conversion from the JSON (text) value to the actual store type; this is needed when extracting a value from a JSON document and e.g. comparing them to a regular database column. For example, the JSON representation of a timestamp is ISO8601 (with a T), but in SQLite, a timestamp is typically represented as a timestamp text without the T (and so `datetime()` must be invoked). Similarly, to convert a geometry WKT representation to an actual SQL Server geometry type, a function to parse the WKT needs to be invoked.~ Moving the server-side conversion part to #30727.\r\n\r\nTests affected:\r\n\r\n* NorthwindJoinQueryTestBase.Join_local_string_closure_is_cached_correctly (string treated as enumerable of chars)\r\n*

Utf8JsonReader requires a UTF8 string, represented as a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`, but strings for databases are generally exposed as .NET string, which is UTF16.\r\n\r\nI think this issue should do the simple/minimal thing, and just transcode the string you get from DbDataReader into a UTF8 byte array on the heap. This isn't the most efficient thing (although most probably still significantly more efficient than the current DOM implementation), but it would work everywhere. Later, as an optimization we can skip that steps for ADO.NET providers where getting a raw UTF8 byte array is supported (Npgsql allows this; SqlClient might, if not we can raise the

This should reduce allocations significantly. Tricky part is that entity materializers are build in a way that assumes we have random access to all the data we need. This is not the case here.\r\nWe read JSON data sequentially and can only do it once, and we don't know the order in which we get the data. This is somewhat problematic in case where entity takes argument in the constructor. Those could be at the very end of the JSON string, so we must read all the data before we can instantiate the object, and populate it's properties and do navigation fixup.\r\nThis requires us reading all the JSON data, store them in local variables, and only when we are done reading we instantiate the entity and populate all the properties with data stored in those variables. This adds some allocations (specifically navigations).\r\n\r\nWe also have to disable de-duplication logic - we can't always safely re-read the JSON string, and definitely can't start reading it from arbitrary position, so now we have to add JSON string for every aggregate projected, even if we already project it's parent.\r\n\r\nSerialization implementation (i.e. Utf8JsonWriter) is pretty straighforward.\r\n\r\nAlso fix to #30993 - Query/Json: data corruption for tracking queries with nested json entities, then updating nested entities outside EF and re-querying\r\n\r\nFix is to recognize and modify shaper in case of tracking query, so that nav expansions are not skipped when parent entity is found in Change Tracker. This is necessary to fix alongside streaming, because now we throw exception from reader (unexpected token) if we don't process the entire stream correctly. Before it would be silently ignored apart from the edge case described in the bug.\r\n\r\nFixes #30604\r\nFixes
