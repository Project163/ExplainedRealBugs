However, the synthetic parameter names contained the name of the parameter and the name of the final (non-complex property), but did not contain the names of intermediate nested complex types containing the property. As a result, if a complex type contains two properties with the same name within different nested complex types, the same parameter name is generated and the old parameter is overridden.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\nWhen setting table-split complex type to a parameter, where multiple nested properties have the same name, an incorrect query is generated, leading either to an error or two data corruption (incorrect data being set in the database).\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\nDuring unrelated work on JSON property
