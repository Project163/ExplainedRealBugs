This has several consequences:\n\n* If the the property being extracted (or any path component) is missing, lax mode returns NULL, whereas strict throws.

The strict behavior may be better here, as a clear failure is probably better than data corruption (see [#36626](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/36626)).\n* Accessing beyond the endd of an array returns NULL in lax mode, and our null compensation can actually cause data corruption (see [#33784](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33784)).\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n* Some/most of the above may be relevant for OPENJSON as well.\n* There's the related lax vs. strict question in the update pipeline (as opposed to query), considerations are likely different there (see [#33565](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/33565)).\n* Although this issue is for SQL Server, the same issues (and a lax/strict distinction) is present in other databases; look at these as part of this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/3299297784","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/36626#issuecomment-3299297784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36626","id":3299297784,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs7Ep0n4","user":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-16T15:29:47Z","updated_at":"2025-09-16T15:38:57Z","body":"Here's what's going on... In the initial JSON implementation, EF persisted enums as strings. Since that was different from how EF persisted enums in regular, non-JSON columns - in that context ints are persisted - we made a breaking change to change the JSON representation to ints as well, e.g. to make it possible to compare JSON properties with non-JSON coluimns. For anyone who already had persisted JSON documents, that meant they have an incompatible legacy representation persisted in the database (we warn for these when reading them).\n\nNow, as long as the JSON document was persisted as `nvarchar(max)`, EF's generated SQL attempted to cast the enum value to an int, and that failed with `Conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value '...' to data type int`, which is what the test checks.\n\nHowever, with the new JSON type, we generate SQL using the new JSON_VALUE RETURNING clause. Andd since with that clause, the conversion is handled as part of JSON_VALUE (and not a separate CAST), it takes into account the lax vs. strict setting used with JSON_VALUE. While strict would throw (similar to the separate CAST), the default lax mode we're using causes JSON_VALUE to return NULL instead, causing the test to fail:\n\n```sql\nSELECT JSON_VALUE(CAST('{ \"LegacyEnum\" : \"foo\" }' AS json), 'strict $.LegacyEnum' RETURNING int);\n```\n\nI've opened #36802 to more generally discuss lax vs. strict - we may want to switch to strict to error for this (just like we do in previous versions). But other than that I don't think there's anything we can do - I'll fix the test to assert the NULL behavior for now with
