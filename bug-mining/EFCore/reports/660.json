was just reviewing the SQL generated for a migration and noticed the following snippet generated for a `DropColumnOperation`:\n\n    IF @var IS NOT NULL EXEC(N'ALTER TABLE [FooBar] DROP CONSTRAINT [' + @var + '];');\n\nStrictly speaking, `QUOTENAME` should be used here in case the constraint name contained a ']' - i.e.:\n\n    IF @var IS NOT NULL EXEC(N'ALTER TABLE [FooBar] DROP CONSTRAINT ' + QUOTENAME(@var) + ';');\n\nThe code that generates this is at: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/202d207420bb3b035973c0b5b6da6018ec64c49e/src/EFCore.SqlServer/Migrations/SqlServerMigrationsSqlGenerator.cs#L2003-L2009\n\nA cursory search shows a few more places where QUOTENAME should be used when concatenating dynamic SQL.\n\nNot sure that it's security issue as I'm having difficulty imagining the threat model (a developer intentionally names a constraint with a SQL injection??)\n\nHappy to submit a PR.","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/36264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
