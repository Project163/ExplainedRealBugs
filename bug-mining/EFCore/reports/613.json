was expecting to find an existing issue for this but I couldn't (if there is one please let me know):\n`ExecuteUpdate` currently only accepts an expression, this means you cannot dynamically build an update query, and do things like this:\n```csharp\nquery.ExecuteUpdate(b =>\n{\n    if (someCondition)\n        b.SetProperty(e => e.Something, \"Something\");\n    else\n        b.SetProperty(e => e.Foo, \"Foo\");\n    b.SetProperty(e => e.Bar, \"Bar\")\n});\n```\n\nBut this would be extremely useful and is sometimes very much needed.\n\nIIRC I believe somebody brought this up somewhere in one of the associated issues (probably in #795), but I don't remember what the response from the EF team was. It kind of seems surprising that this isn't already supported (there are [Stack Overflow questions](https://stackoverflow.com/q/75924095/7734384) about it, for example). The expressions passed to `.SetProperty()` are all that matters anyway, so it seems like the `ExecuteUpdate` parameter being an expression is unnecessary, it could've just been an `Action`, but definitely correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks.\n\n**Update:** Found the comment that had mentioned this: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/795#issuecomment-1204547535 (see surrounding conversation) — Shay then said [this](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/795#issuecomment-1204548747):\n> Ah, could be... @smitpatel will determine whether this is feasible and reasonable to implement.\n\nI don't think there were any updates afterwards.\\","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32018/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
