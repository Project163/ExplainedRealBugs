(@AndriySvyryd it this right, any more context?).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, using `OUTPUT INTO` instead of `OUTPUT` adds a lot of overhead:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// * Summary *\r\n\r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.13.0, OS=ubuntu 21.10\r\nIntel Xeon W-2133 CPU 3.60GHz, 1 CPU, 12 logical and 6 physical cores\r\n.NET SDK=6.0.101\r\n  [Host]     : .NET 6.0.1 (6.0.121.56705), X64 RyuJIT\r\n  DefaultJob : .NET 6.0.1 (6.0.121.56705), X64 RyuJIT\r\n\r\n\r\n|     Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Ratio | RatioSD |\r\n|----------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|------:|--------:|\r\n|   NoOutput | 2.119 ms | 0.0423 ms | 0.0396 ms |  0.39 |    0.01 |\r\n|     Output | 1.926 ms | 0.0382 ms | 0.0497 ms |  0.36 |    0.02 |\r\n| OutputInto | 5.365 ms | 0.1068 ms | 0.2083 ms |  1.00 |    0.00 |\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's over 3ms just for passing through a TVP! Also, mysteriously the version with no OUTPUT clause at all performs worse...\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n\r\n* We could default to using `OUTPUT`, and switch back to `OUTPUT INTO` if the user tells us the table has triggers (via metadata).\r\n* Note that we have #9118 for not retrieving anything; this would make this optimization a bit less valuable.\r\n* If the table has any IDENTITY column, OUTPUT

https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/issues/1164. The parameter InstrumentModulesWithoutLocalSources has been removed. since it can be handled by setting ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to None.\nThe default heuristics for determining whether to instrument an assembly has been changed. In previous versions any missing source file was taken as a signal that it was a third-party project that shouldn't be instrumented, with exceptions for some common file name patterns for source generators. Now only assemblies where no source files at all can be found are excluded from instrumentation, and the code for detecting source generator files have been removed. To get back to the behaviour that at least one missing file is sufficient to exclude an assembly, set ExcludeAssembliesWithoutSources to MissingAny, or use assembly exclusion filters for more fine-grained control.\n\n[Diff between 3.2.0 and 6.0.0](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/compare/v5.7.2...v6.0.0)\n\n## 5.8.0\n\n### Fixed\n-Fix TypeLoadException when referencing
