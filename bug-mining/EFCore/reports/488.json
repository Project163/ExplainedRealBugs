preprocessing (nav expansion) produces LeftJoin nodes for owned entity collection, such as in the following case:\n\n```c#\npublic virtual Task Filter_owned_entity_chained_with_regular_entity_followed_by_projecting_owned_collection(bool async)\n    => AssertQuery(\n        async,\n        ss => ss.Set<OwnedPerson>().Where(p => p.PersonAddress.Country.Planet.Id != 42).OrderBy(p => p.Id)\n            .Select(p => new { p.Orders }),\n        assertOrder: true,\n        elementAsserter: (e, a) => AssertCollection(e.Orders, a.Orders));\n```\n\nOf course, in Cosmos (and in relational JSON), p.Orders doesn't represent a join at all; so we need to ignore it, reverse-engineering the original query so that this can be translated.\n\nLong-term, we should get rid of these nodes altogether by removing nav expansion as a preprocessing step
