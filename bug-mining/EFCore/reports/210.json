**GetSchemaTable** or **GetColumnSchema** on **SqliteDataReader** when you have a table schema with double quotes throws a **SqliteException** indicating a syntax error.\r\n\r\nFor example, tables with quotation marks (valid according to SQLite documentation, as long as it's escaped):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE \"Bad\"\"Table\"(\r\n    Column1 INTEGER,\r\n    Column2 INTEGER\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat query creates a valid table with the name ```Bad\"Table```; however, when attempting to get the schema for a query against this table, an exception is thrown indicating a syntax error.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM \"Bad\"\"Table\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused by **GetSchemaTable** not properly escaping the table name when generating the queries necessary to build/infer the table schema. This appears to be a bug, because the table name is a valid.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException (0x80004005): SQLite Error 1: 'near \"Table\": syntax error'.\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException.ThrowExceptionForRC(Int32 rc, sqlite3 db)\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteCommand.PrepareAndEnumerateStatements(Stopwatch timer)+MoveNext()\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteCommand.GetStatements(Stopwatch timer)+MoveNext()\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteDataReader.NextResult()\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteCommand.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior behavior)\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteCommand.ExecuteReader()\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteCommand.ExecuteScalar()\r\n   at Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteDataReader.GetSchemaTable()\r\n   at System.Data.Common.DbDataReaderExtensions.GetColumnSchemaCompatibility(DbDataReader reader)\r\n   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in /home/cshutchinson/RiderProjects/SqliteSchemaBug/SqliteSchemaBug/Program.cs:line 24\r\n```\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Data.Sqlite version: 7.0.3\r\nTarget framework: .NET 7.0\r\nOperating system: Windows 11 Enterprise (64-bit)\r\n\r\n[SqliteSchemaBug.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/files/10924480/SqliteSchemaBug.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bricelam","id":1226749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1226749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam","html_url":"https://github.com/bricelam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bricelam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
