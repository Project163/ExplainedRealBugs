`Property` for a primitive collection.

If `PrimitiveCollection` is used, then the error goes away:\n\n```C#\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Model>().PrimitiveCollection(x => x.Uids).HasField(\"_uids\");\n```\n\n@Red-F Is there a reason for using `Property` here instead of `PrimitiveCollection`?

Please review the migration for accuracy.\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Cannot scaffold C# literals of type 'System.Reflection.NullabilityInfoContext'. The provider should implement CoreTypeMapping.GenerateCodeLiteral to support using it at design time.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of testing I found that the problem was mapping table valued functions from the DB, but only if the mapped model contains 'string' properties. Otherwise, it works normally.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nHere is a small code to reproduce the issue in a console app:\r\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\r\n\r\nnamespace Test;\r\n\r\npublic class Program\r\n{\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        using var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)\r\n            .ConfigureServices(services => services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(\"ConnectionString\")))\r\n            .Build();\r\n\r\n        host.Run();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext\r\n{\r\n    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options) { }\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n    {\r\n        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);\r\n\r\n        modelBuilder.HasDbFunction(typeof(ApplicationDbContext).GetMethod(nameof(TableValueFunctionTest), new[] { typeof(DateTime), typeof(decimal) }));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public IQueryable<Data> TableValueFunctionTest(DateTime param1, decimal param2) => FromExpression(() => TableValueFunctionTest(param1, param2));\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Keyless]\r\npublic class Data\r\n{\r\n    public string Text { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public int Number { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public long BigNumber { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe .csproj file contains this:\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\t<ItemGroup>\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting\" Version=\"7.0.0\" />\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore\" Version=\"7.0.2\" />\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\" Version=\"7.0.2\">\r\n\t\t\t<IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>\r\n\t\t\t<PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>\r\n\t\t</PackageReference>\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational\" Version=\"7.0.2\" />\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\" Version=\"7.0.2\" />\r\n\t\t<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools\" Version=\"7.0.2\">\r\n\t\t\t<PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>\r\n\t\t\t<IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>\r\n\t\t</PackageReference>\r\n\t</ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIn the previous code, commenting out the property \"Text\", or changing its type (I tested with int, decimal, double, and DateTime) makes the migration work. Also downgrading to EF 6.0.10 works. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I tried adding the migration using the dotnet-ef tool (updated to 7.0.2) with the command:\r\n```\r\ndotnet ef migrations add Test\r\n```\r\nAlso tried with the old\r\n```\r\nAdd-Migration Test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Further technical details\r\n\r\nEF Core version: 7.0.2\r\nDatabase provider: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\r\nTarget framework:  .NET 7.0\r\nOperating system: Windows 11\r\nIDE: Visual Studio 2022 17.4\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/30142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2449375000","html_url":"https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/34996#issuecomment-2449375000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34996","id":2449375000,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAPaMMs6R_n8Y","user":{"login":"Red-F","id":486021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F","html_url":"https://github.com/Red-F","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-31T09:08:10Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T09:08:10Z","body":"@ajcvickers Why do we do the things that we do? A long time ago I saw a video where you discussed/explained this 'defensive copy' pattern. I liked that. A lot, because I think we need to make it as difficult as possible for ourselves to  unintentionally make mistakes. So I use IReadOnlyCollection<T> properties with a backing field of List<T> everywhere.\n\nSInce I like my code to be predictable for future me or new readers, that means I use IReadOnlyCollection\\<string\\> as well. Just to have no surprises for readers/reviewers.\n\nI guess the same applies to the model configuration. Just predictably repeated configuration for all the collections. And to be honest, I also was not aware of .PrimitiveCollection(x => x.property). Even after reading your comment it took some effort to find it!\n\nI was able to get it working using a workaround like\n\n```c#\n        builder.Property(x => x.Uids).HasField(\"_uids\")\n            .HasConversion(\n                v => JsonConvert.SerializeObject(v, (JsonSerializerSettings?)null),\n                v => JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<string>>(v, (JsonSerializerSettings?)null)!,\n                ReadOnlyCollectionValueComparer<string>.Create());\n```\n\nbut my extensive reading of the online documentation (age will teach a person that reading documentation is a GOOD thing) had me convinced that the original code should work. In addition, the create and drop apis do work as intended, it is just that I can't create a migration (bundle).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/2449375000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Red-F","id":486021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F","html_url":"https://github.com/Red-F","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Red-F/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15027497743,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs6cCZltzwAAAAN_tWsP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15027497743","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-31T09:08:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15027497769,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs6cCZltzwAAAAN_tWsp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15027497769","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-31T09:08:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15249643349,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs6cCZltzwAAAAOM8xdV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/15249643349","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a558138a52f66636e5280126dcad5aef20197c13","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/commits/a558138a52f66636e5280126dcad5aef20197c13","created_at":"2024-11-11T12:47:20Z","performed_via_github_app":nul
