Bug description\n\nWhen an already-cancelled `CancellationToken` is specified in a query, EF core seems to log the `OperationCanceledException` that is thrown when EF tries to open the connection.\n\nIt's caught with `catch (Exception e)`, logged as \"Opening connection to database '...' on server '...'\", and rethrown,\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/a1541cb0e454260f93acda8485de761e732202ca/src/EFCore.Relational/Storage/RelationalConnection.cs#L748-L786\n\nI think cancellations should be rethrown _without being logged_ 🤔.\n\n### Your code\n\n```csharp\nstatic async Task Main()\n{\n\tvar sp = new ServiceCollection()\n\t\t.AddDbContext<Db>()\n\t\t.AddLogging((options) => options\n\t\t\t.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug)\n\t\t\t.AddSimpleConsole()\n\t\t\t.AddFilter(\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query\", LogLevel.None)\n\t\t\t.AddFilter(\"Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure\", LogLevel.None)\n\t\t)\n\t\t.BuildServiceProvider();\n\n\tusing var scope = sp.CreateScope();\n\tvar db = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<Db>();\n\n\tvar s = new CancellationTokenSource();\n\ts.Cancel();\n\n\ttry\n\t{\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(\"query\");\n\t\tawait db.Entities.FromSqlRaw(\"SELECT 1 AS id\").ToListAsync(s.Token);\n\t}\n\tcatch (OperationCanceledException)\n\t{\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine(\"cancelled; ignored\");\n\t}\n}\n\n[Table(\"entity\")]\nclass Entity\n{\n\t[Column(\"id\")]\n\tpublic required int Id { get; set; }\n}\n\npartial class Db(DbContextOptions<Db> options) : DbContext(options)\n{\n\tpublic required DbSet<Entity> Entities { get; init; }\n}\n```\n\n**Output below.** The highlighted lines are caused by the `OperationCanceledException` being logged by EF.\n\n```diff\n query\n dbug:
