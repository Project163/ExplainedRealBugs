doesn't currently extend ExpressionVisitor, and does not have a general Visit() method. Visitation is done via specialized methods: these accept `allowOptimizedExpansion` as a parameter, and return `nullable` as an output parameter. Aside from the specialized visitation method syntax, the idea here is to make sure all visitation is explicitly specified for all expression types, i.e. that visitation doesn't fall back to VisitChildren() because of an omission, and proper nullability calculation isn't done.\r\n\r\nWhile the above makes sense for SqlExpression, it doesn't for other expression types; for most e.g. table expressions, the VisitChildren() logic is duplicated inside this visitor. In addition, we cannot use various general visitation utilities, such as VisitAndConvert.\r\n\r\nWe should make SqlNullabilityProcessor a real visitor, and employ the regular visitation techniques until a SqlExpression is reached; at that point, use the current mechanism of specialized visitation methods. I'm not sure using specialized methods make sense even for SqlExpression, as opposed to just passing allowOptimizedExpansion/nullable via visitor state (there's already various other state), but it's a first step.\r\n\r\n/cc @maumar @cincuranet @ranma42 ","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
