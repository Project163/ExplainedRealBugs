This is the recommend thing until complex type collection support is built into EF.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the quick reply! I actually don't need to map to JSON at all. I just need navigation and tracking. I've been studying the code from EF7 quite a bit and just recently switched to EF 8 in the hopes of using complex types with collection support (found out after the switch collections are not yet supported).\r\n\r\nIt might be over my head. I was hoping with a high level overview I'd be able to do it, but I understand if you don't have the time to write all of it out. I figured it wouldn't be too bad since EF Core already supports complex types with nested / navigation  to other entity types. I'm familiar with how entity types are defined; how properties / navigations are built up using the internal builders, which get created into a RuntimeModel through the RuntimeModelConvention class on DbContext creation; how snapshots are created, how there is a relationship snapshot, original values snapshot, how those values are \"copied\" and set in one of the Snapshot classes; how these snapshot values are looked up later via the property's index of interest (relationship index, original value index, etc.). Basically, I've been studying the code for a bit now and while I am no expert by any means, I am not a stranger either.\r\n\r\nI will admit Owned Types are one of the things I have not explored as of yet. I basically want to be able to pass in an IIS data model, which as you can imagine, doesn't quite fit very well into how EF Core handles entities. I'm not sure if Owned Types would be the solution here, but it seems like Complex Types would do the trick (if collections were supported).\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ApplicationPool\r\n{\r\n    public string Name { get; set; } = null!;\r\n\r\n    public bool AutoStart { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public bool Enable32BitAppOnWin64 { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public string RuntimeVersion { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public List<Site>?

Where supported, such collections are also fully queryable via the regular LINQ operators.\n\nAs a by-product of this, the translation for `intParam.Contains(b => b.Property)` would be changed from the current IN with constants translation to a string parameter containing an JSON array, which would be unpacked at the database and queried via the standard means.
