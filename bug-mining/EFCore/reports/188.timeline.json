There is no good workaround, customers need to edit JSON and add the missing element(s). Also, we already patched similar issue, when the \"leaf\" property was missing rather than navigation - see https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29219\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\n\r\nMultiple customer reports on 7.0.\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\n\r\nNo. JSON support has been introduced in 7.0.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nAdded regression tests.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow-Mid; Fix is relatively small and involves hand-crafting expression call to TryGetValue() rather than GetValue() that we used before. Additional risk comes from the fact that the change is in common code path. It gets used every time JSON is mapped to entities that are nested (e.g. Customer entity having Details entity mapped to JSON, and Details entity itself has a sub-entity Address mapped to the same JSON). Added quirk to revert to old behavior if

For example, consider this table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE [Members] (\r\n    [Id] int NOT NULL IDENTITY,\r\n    [Name] nvarchar(max) NULL,\r\n    [IsActive] bit NOT NULL DEFAULT CAST(1 AS bit),\r\n    CONSTRAINT [PK_Member] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF8 now parses literal values in column default constraints, allowing `HasDefaultValue` to be scaffolded instead of `HasDefaultValyeSql`. For example, `CAST(1 AS bit)` is parsed as `true`:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nmodelBuilder.Entity<Member>(entity =>\r\n{\r\n    entity.Property(e => e.IsActive).HasDefaultValue(true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nEF checks the value of a property to determine whether or not to let the database generate a value. Starting with EF8, [this check can be customized](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/701). This means that EF8 will send `false` to the database when needed, since database default is known to be `true`. \r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n- Major progress on value objects with the merge of [_Add complex types to Metadata_](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31003).\r\n- A PR with changes to JSON serialization is [out for review](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/31160)\r\n- Unfortunately, the [T4 tooling changes](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/plan#first-class-t4-templates-in-visual-studio) planned for Visual Studio have been cut.\r\n\r\n## EF Core 8 (EF8)\r\n\r\nEF Core 8 (EF8) will be the next release after EF Core 7.0.
