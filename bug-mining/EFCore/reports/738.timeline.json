When an entity contains a non-collection complex property (e.g., `NestedJson`) which itself contains a complex collection (e.g., `Items`), modifications to the nested collection are not detected by `DetectChanges()`, causing `SaveChanges()` to skip the UPDATE statement.\r\n\r\n**Customer impact**\r\n\r\nWhen customers modify nested complex collections, their changes are silently ignored and not persisted to the database. This breaks the expected behavior where all tracked changes should be detected and saved and leads to data loss.\r\nThere is a workaround that allows marking the items as modified manually, but this is error-prone.\r\n\r\n**How found**\r\n\r\nCustomer reported on 10.0.0-rc2\r\n\r\n**Regression**\r\n\r\nNo, new feature\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nTest added\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow.

You can't compile this line `var items = nestedJson.ComplexCollection(j => j.Items);` becasue `j` is of type `Blog` not `NestedJson`\n\nThe workaround is to mark the whole complex property as modified like this `context.Entry(blog).ComplexProperty(b => b.NestedJson).IsModified = true` and that's probably what's most practical as it's super impractical to actually detect what exactly changed inside the complex property\n\n\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/3480522711/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mario-mestrovic","id":3209068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDkwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mario-mestrovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mario-mestrovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20674762582,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs7ToIDGzwAAAATQT9dW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/20674762582","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-11-03T13:25:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20674762611,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs7ToIDGzwAAAATQT9dz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/20674762611","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-11-03T13:25:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20684291556,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAPaMMs7ToIDGzwAAAATQ4T3k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/20684291556","actor":{"login":"AndriySvyryd","id":6539701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6539701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd","html_url":"https://github.com/AndriySvyryd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndriySvyryd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"43bcc1fe0cab9c99
