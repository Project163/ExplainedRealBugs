SQL has preview support for vector search ([post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/announcing-eap-native-vector-support-in-azure-sql-database/), [post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/eap-for-vector-support-refresh-introducing-vector-type/)), and EF currently supports this via the [EFCore.SqlServer.VectorSearch](https://github.com/efcore/EFCore.SqlServer.VectorSearch) plugin.\n\nThe vector support will be going GA soon; once that happens, we should move the functionality from the external plugin into the SQL Server provider, so users just get it out of the box without needing an external package.\n\nNote that as part of going GA, the wire encoding of vector data is changing: while vectors are currently being transferred as JSON array strings, they will start getting transferred via an efficient binary encoding instead. Support for this is required in SqlClient, and SqlClient 6.1 - currently in preview and planned to be LTS - is expected to have this support. This means that we'll also need to take a dependency on SqlClient 6.1, and do the work of modifying the EF vector support to use the new binary encoding.\n\n/cc @saurabh500 @cheenamalhotra @yorek @SamMonoRT ","closed_by":{"login":"roji","id":1862641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1862641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji","html_url":"https://github.com/roji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34659/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/34659/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
