You can get back the previous behavior by setting your own value comparer. For example:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n        var comparer = new ValueComparer<string>(\r\n            (l, r) => string.Equals(l, r, StringComparison.Ordinal),\r\n            v => v.GetHashCode(),\r\n            v => v);\r\n\r\n\r\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Foo>(\r\n            b =>\r\n            {\r\n                b.HasIndex(x => x.Name).IsUnique();\r\n                b.Property(e => e.Name).Metadata.SetValueComparer(comparer);\r\n            });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote for triage: it's not clear that setting the collation should change this because we don't know whether the collation is case sensitive or insensitive. It's also not clear to me that we should have done this by default for index columns, but it's also not clear that we shouldn't. For now, I think we should document as a breaking change with the mitigation being the code above.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/comments/1906176556/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11571132980,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAPaMMs588b7QzwAAAAKxsXo0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11571132980","actor":{"login":"GeorgDangl","id":10274404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjc0NDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10274404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl","html_url":"https://github.com/GeorgDangl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-06T12:12:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11571132999,"node_id":"SE_lADOAPaMMs588b7QzwAAAAKxsXpH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/events/11571132999","actor":{"login":"GeorgDangl","id":10274404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjc0NDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10274404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl","html_url":"https://github.com/GeorgDangl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgDangl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-06T12:12:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ajcvickers","id":1430078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzAwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers","html_url":"https://github.com/ajcvickers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajcvickers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-07T14:24:57Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T14:31:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32546","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotnet/efcore/issues/32546/labels{/name}","c
