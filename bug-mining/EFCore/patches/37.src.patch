 EF Core does not generally need any prerequisites installed to build the code. However, running tests requires certain local databases to be available:
 
 * The SQL Server tests require a local SQL Server installation. This can be:
-  * SQL Server LocalDb, usually obtained by installing the latest [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) public preview with the "ASP.NET and web development" workload selected.
+  * SQL Server LocalDb, usually obtained by installing the latest [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) public preview with the "ASP.NET and web development" workload selected.
   * SQL Server [Express or Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads). When not using LocalDb, make sure to set the environment variable `Test__SqlServer__DefaultConnection` to the connection string that EF Core tests should use.
 * The Cosmos tests require that the [Azure Cosmos Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator-release-notes) is installed. Use the default installation options. Make sure to re-start the emulator each time you restart your machine.
   * The Cosmos tests are optional and will be skipped if the emulator is not available. If you are not making Cosmos changes, then you may choose to skip installing the emulator and let the continuous integration system handle Cosmos testing.

-
-# Earlier versions (2.x or older)
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-The following prerequisites are required to work with the EF Core code:
-
-* [**Visual Studio 2017 15.8**](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
-* **.NET Core 2.2 Preview SDK** (Installed by build script automatically)
-
-## Clone the repository
-
-Using your favorite [git](http://git-scm.com/) client, clone the repository.
-
-```console
-git clone https://github.com/dotnet/efcore.git
-```
-
-## Build initialization
-
-Run at least the following before using Visual Studio for the first time:
-
-```console
-build /t:Compile
-```
-
-If you get a ⚠️ warning about KoreBuild using different dotnet than the one which exists in PATH variable, then you need to update your PATH variable such that dotnet installed by KoreBuild in `%USERPROFILE%` appears before any other dotnet installed. Only after that opening solution in Visual Studio will work correctly. See Updating PATH to use preview .NET Core SDK under Build from Visual Studio for more information on steps.
-
-## Build from the command line
-
-To build and run tests:
-
-```console
-build
-```
-
-To build and create packages without running tests:
-
-```console
-build /t:Package
-```
-
-## Build from Visual Studio
-
-* Just open the .sln file. (After running the build initialization from the command line and updating your Path if needed.)
-* NuGet packages will already have been restored, so you can switch off auto package restore in Visual Studio.
-
-### Updating PATH to use preview .NET Core SDK
-
-* Since KoreBuild installs preview version of .NET Core SDK in `%USERPROFILE%` folder, your path needs to use that dotnet for VS to work correctly. Especially the preview version of dotnet should appear before any other dotnet in your PATH variable. You can either set your environment variables globally and just open solution in VS normally or you can set PATH variable locally in command line and open solution from command line.
-
-Following are steps to update PATH locally & open solution in VS in PowerShell. Similar steps can be used in any other command terminal. (drop `/x64` if you are on 32 bit machine)
-
-```PowerShell
-.\build /t:Compile
-$env:PATH="$env:USERPROFILE/.dotnet/x64;"+$env:PATH
-.\EFCore.sln
-```
-
-### Solving common build errors
-
-1. Check that the package source URLs listed in the Nuget.config file in the root of the repository are accessible.
-2. Clean the source directory. `git clean -xid` will clean files in the EF source directory.
-3. Clear nuget packages and caches. `nuget.exe locals all -clear` will delete the NuGet caches. (You can get nuget.exe from <https://dist.nuget.org/index.html> or use `dotnet nuget`).
-4. Reinstall .NET Core CLI. Our build script automatically installs a version to `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet`.
-
-### Run tests
-
-Our tests are written using [xUnit.net 2.0](http://xunit.github.io/), and can be run with [TestDriven.Net](http://www.testdriven.net/). You may need to [tweak the TestDriven.NET installation](https://github.com/jcansdale/TestDriven.Net-Issues/issues/76#issuecomment-288583932) to get it working with the latest VS.
-
-Other test runners may also work--people have had luck with the ReSharper test runner and the CodeRush runner.

 ### ReSharper
 
 Some people on the team use [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/) to increase productivity. Currently the EAP builds of the latest release seem to be working well. Some people see better performance if ReSharper testing support is disabled.
