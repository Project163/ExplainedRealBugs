I have another idea for how to solve it, though: config options that let you opt in or opt out particular examples from being considered for the top N slowest examples based on metadata. You may want to only profile examples tagged with :unit, for example. Or, in your case, you could tag the existing 10 slowest examples (which you can't optimize further) with something like :skip_profile so they are not considered.  \n\nI think both approaches have their merits.

on the fence about this: I love composable designs, but I also really like the fact that the profile output is available from multiple formatters.  Moving this into a separate formatter would not easily support adding profile info to any formatter.\n\nOverall, I agree with @dchelimsky that it would have been a better code design to put the profiling in its own formatter from the start, but given how it works now, I'm not convinced it's worth the ROI to refactor towards a separate formatter.  So yeah, go ahead and take a stab at this, @greggroth.  If I change my mind in the future regarding the ROI of refactoring to a separate formatter, I can deal with the added complexity of an additional config
