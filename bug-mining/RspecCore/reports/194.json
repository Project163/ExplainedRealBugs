rspec-users)\n\nConsider this rather silly test case (in the file `spec/test_spec.rb`):\n\n```\ndescribe \"something\" do\n  context \"in context\" do\n    subject { \"an object\" }\n    it { should == \"an object\" }\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWhen I run rspec with `--format documentation`, I see the nifty documentation generated by the matcher itself:\n\n```\nsomething\n  in context\n    should == \"an object\"\n```\n\nHowever, this is what I see for this example when I run with `--format json` (modulo pretty printing):\n\n```\n{ \n    \"status\": \"passed\",\n    \"description\": \"should == \\\"an object\\\"\",\n    \"full_description\": \"something in context \",\n    \"line_number\": 4,\n    \"file_path\": \"./spec/test_spec.rb\"\n}\n```\n\nNote that the full_description is missing the matcher documentation. And with ci_reporter 1.8.4, this comes out as a sorry hash indeed, because _only_ the full descriptions are reported to CI. Here's the trimmed XML output for `SPEC-something-in-context.xml`:\n\n``` xml\n<testsuite errors=\"0\" tests=\"1\" failures=\"0\" name=\"something in context\" skipped=\"0\" time=\"0.00102\">\n  <testcase name=\"something in context \" time=\"0.000651\" />\n  ...\n</testsuite>\n```\n\nNow imagine you had 15-20 test cases whose names were all \"something in context\". Ugh.\n\nWhat I want to see is the generated matcher documentation being added to the end of the full description of the example, and showing up in my CI reports.\n\nThe JSON output should be:\n\n```\n{\n    \"status\": \"passed\",\n    \"description\": \"should == \\\"an object\\\"\",\n    \"full_description\": \"something in context should == \\\"an object\\\"\",\n    \"line_number\": 4,\n    \"file_path\": \"./spec/test_spec.rb\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the CI output for `SPEC-something-in-context.xml` should be:\n\n``` xml\n<testsuite errors=\"0\" tests=\"1\" failures=\"0\" name=\"something in context\" skipped=\"0\" time=\"0.00102\">\n  <testcase name=\"something in context should == &quot;an object&quot;\" time=\"0.000651\" />\n  ...\n</testsuite>\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/849/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
