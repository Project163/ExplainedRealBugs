So, I suppose that exist a problem in the <code>.gemspec</code> inside the project.\n\nWhen I saw the [.gemspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/rspec-core.gemspec) file, I didn't see any reference to <code>bin</code> folder. But [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/commit/0f55f0f0c227e6896df4c0f59dfee5b2df39c8bd#rspec-core.gemspec) I can see the new <code>bindir</code>, however it's looking for a folder called <code>bin</code>.\n\nI need execute some command, run something? Before this gem update, I was using <code>2.6.4</code> version and all of my specs were working fine.\n\nI'm using this [gems](https://gist.github.com/1293103) cause this help to identify this problem.\n\nThanks for your help.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
