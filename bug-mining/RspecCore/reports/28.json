Seems like a problem for rspec to stomp on this ruby-debug method just for using it in a library. Commenting this extension out solved the issue. Also wrapping the method definition in a `unless respond_to?(:debugger)` fixed the issue.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/76/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
