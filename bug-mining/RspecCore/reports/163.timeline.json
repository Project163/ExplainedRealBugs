for reporting this.  Did the test have another error (which would have been reported as the test failure)?\n\nI'm not sure of the right fix for this, but here are a couple ideas:\n- We can keep the printing of the error but change the wording so that it is clear that it wasn't in an after(:each) hook but rather from a mock expectation failure.\n- We can change the verifying of mocks [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/commit/27059bf1fd39589af3e042485ba366fc06b4ecbe#L0R302) so that additional errors raised by mock expectations do not get printed.  Mock expectation errors that are the first/only error in an example will still get raised and fail the example, of course.\n- We can change it so that the mocks are verified only if there hasn't already been an exception.\n\nIn general, I think silencing errors is evil--that's why I added this code to print out the error when an additional error occurs in after hook or around hook.

The hooks work great to allow VCR to do its (largely orthogonal) thing, while allowing the end user of RSpec/VCR to put their test code in the example block.  The problem was that I had accidentally misconfigured VCR so that what it did in the `after` hook raised an error.  The conditions that triggered the error in the after hook occurred with an example that had a test failure of its own.  In RSpec 2.10, the error in the after hook was handled and it called `set_exception`, but due to [its use of ||=](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/v2.10.1/lib/rspec/core/example.rb#L162-164), the exception was silently ignored.\n\nWhile I'm not ready to do a large refactoring to fully support multiple failures per example, I think it's important that RSpec does not silently swallow errors from after/around hooks when the example has already had a failure.  That's what motivated my original change, and I still want to keep it (or something like it) in some form.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/7046628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20440040,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNDQwMDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/20440040","actor":{"login":"justinko","id":14007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko","html_url":"https://github.com/justinko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-07-17T22:57:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/7055674","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/651#issuecomment-7055674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/651","id":7055674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTU2NzQ=","user":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-07-18T03:16:29Z","updated_at":"2012-07-18T03:16:29Z","body":"I'm planning to get a 2.11.1 release of rspec-core out in the next day or two, and I want to include some kind of fix for this, even if it's not the final solution.  We can always implement a better solution for 2.12.\n\nFor the 2.11.1 fix I'm currently leaning towards not printing anything for mock expectation errors that happen in examples that have already failed.  The only reason there is something printed now is because the mock expectations are verified in the same method that runs after hooks--it was never intended, and RSpec has never printed errors for mock expectations in this kind of circumstance before. The point in the example where mock expectations are verified is an implementation detail we don't need to expose to end users.\n\nI'll try to have this fix ready
