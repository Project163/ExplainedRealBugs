For example, the following all work:\n\n``` ruby\ndescribe 3 do\n  it { is_expected.to be_between(2, 4) }\nend\n\ndescribe 3.1 do\n  it { is_expected.to be_a(Float) }\nend\n\ndescribe [\"foo\"] do\n  it { is_expected.to eq [\"foo\"] }\nend\n\ndescribe (1..10) do\n  it { is_expected.to be_a(Range) }\nend\n\ndescribe Date.today do\n  it { is_expected.to be_a(Date) }\nend\n\ndescribe Time.now do\n  it { is_expected.to be_a(Time) }\nend\n```\n\nIt looks like hashes don't, however:\n\n``` ruby\ndescribe({:foo => 3, :bar => 2}) do\n  it { is_expected.to be_a(Hash) }\nend\n```\n\n...fails with `expected \"\" to be a kind of Hash`.

IMO this behavior is non-intuitive.  rspec/rspec-core#1114 seems to have made an exception for when the inner describe is an instance of String, which makes sense, because `described_class.should be_a(Class)`.  However, I argue that this should be consistent for all cases where the inner describe is not a Class.  Either take its class, or skip it and move to the outer describe block, but don't return an instance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec/issues/31/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"yujinakayama","id":83656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama","html_url":"https://github.com/yujinakayama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-07T00:02:02Z","updated_at":"2014-07-07T00:02:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yujinakayama/transpec/issues/76","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yujinakayama/transpec","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yujinakayama/transpec/issues/76/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yujinakayama/transpec/issues/76/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yujinakayama/transpec/issues/76/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yujinakayama/transpec/issues/76","id":36709653,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjcwOTY1Mw==","number":76,"title":"Tests
