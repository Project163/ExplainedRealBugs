change affects [Specjour](https://github.com/sandro/specjour), which [invokes](https://github.com/sandro/specjour/blob/master/lib/specjour/worker.rb#L81) the [runner](https://github.com/sandro/specjour/blob/master/lib/specjour/rspec/runner.rb) multiple times within the same process.\n\nThe issue occurs when using rspec-rails features that are included into the configuration object at require-time. Take `rspec/rails/mocks` for instance. Specjour loads the rails app by requiring `spec_helper`, which requires `rspec/rails/mocks`, which includes itself into the configuration object. Specjour then runs the next test off the stack.\n\nThe first test runs fine. When the configuration object is set to `nil` however, the next test that runs lazy-loads a new configuration object that is missing the mocks framework.\n\nSpecjour already does some monkey-patching, so I could monkey-patch my way out of this issue, but I figured I'd offer Specjour's perspective. Can we keep the configuration object around?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/6214304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sandro","id":9643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro","html_url":"https://github.com/sandro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17307598,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3MzA3NTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/17307598","actor":{"login":"sandro","id":9643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro","html_url":"https://github.com/sandro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-06-08T22:16:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
