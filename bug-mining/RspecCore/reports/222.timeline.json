by Myron to report this per this thread:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/24176446/rspec-capybara-loading-in-progress-circular-require-considered-harmful/24177563?noredirect=1#comment37583160_24177563\n\nHere are my versions:\n\n```\n * rspec-core (3.0.1)\n  * rspec-expectations (3.0.1)\n  * rspec-mocks (3.0.1)\n  * rspec-rails (3.0.1)\n  * rspec-support (3.0.0)\n```\n\nThis is on Rails 4.1.0 on Ruby 2.1.1.\n\nThe default .rspec file created for me by installation contained these 3 lines initially:\n\n```\n--color\n--warnings\n--require spec_helper\n```\n\nOn running rspec (or \"rake spec\" or \"bundle exec rake spec\"), reams and reams of warnings were generated.  These were mostly of the \"circular require considered harmful\" variety.\n\nSo, I went searching for a solution and found the above StackOverflow post.  Sure enough, removing the \"--warnings\" line from my .rspec stopped the warnings.  But, on a whim, I tried removing the \"--require spec_helper\" line from .rspec instead - this resulted in a much smaller number of warnings, and none of the \"circular require\"

It should of course be simple to turn it off for existing projects that can't realistically enable it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":931843615,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkzMTg0MzYxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/931843615","actor":{"login":"varyonic","id":780081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/780081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic","html_url":"https://github.com/varyonic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/varyonic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cb845df0a774e66c18e0f55bac599bf473b2e92e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varyonic/demo.activeadmin.info/commits/cb845df0a774e66c18e0f55bac599bf473b2e92e","created_at":"2017-01-22T00:47:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
