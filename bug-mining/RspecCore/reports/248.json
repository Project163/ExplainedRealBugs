This is unfortunate, because for a BDD outside-in style workflow, it's really useful to be able to mark an end-to-end acceptance/feature spec as `pending` while you drive out the details with unit specs.  During this process it's nice to be able to re-run the acceptance spec and see where it's currently at.  As things currently work, you'd have to un-pend it, run it, and then re-pend it, which is pretty sub-optimal.\n\nSo, it'd be nice if `pending` specs displayed their failures\n","closed_by":{"login":"JonRowe","id":162976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JonRowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
