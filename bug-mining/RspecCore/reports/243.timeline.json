The problem here is that the filter manager applies its filters to every example group. The location filter you give above then reduces it down to a single example no matter which files are passed. The other problem here is that the list of files is run through `uniq` so that with the two runs of the same file we're only ever going to see it once. Part of the reason for the `uniq` call is when two globs hit the same file twice.\n\n@myronmarston I guess if a file is added explicitly it could get a location filter matching every line, that'd at least solve the second sample. The first one is a little more complicated. Do you have any thoughts?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/19854824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fables-tales","id":96662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales","html_url":"https://github.com/fables-tales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":53700661,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTM3MDA2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/53700661","actor":{"login":"garybernhardt","id":45707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/garybernhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-06-22T10:51:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":53700662,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUzNzAwNjYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/53700662","actor":{"login":"garybernhardt","id":45707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt","html_url":"https://github.com/garybernhardt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garybernhardt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-06-22T10:51:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":53700663,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTM3MDA2NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/53700663","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-06-22T10:51:21Z",

think this is something we can improve in RSpec 3 (which we've already started on).  I think it make sense to change location filters so they apply only to the specified file.  Then your `rspec -fd temp_spec.rb:2 other_spec_file.rb` should work to run one example from `temp_spec` and all examples from `other_spec_file`.\n\nYour `rspec -fd temp_spec.rb:2 temp_spec.rb` example is trickier though: you intend it to control the order examples are run in, but there's a separate API for that that's not easily made compatible with that.  By default, specs are run in the order they are defined, and there is a `--random` option for running them in a random order (with a random seed printed off at the end).  Files are loaded in a consistent order (alphabetical, but that's an implementation detail) to help maintain consistent ordering when specifying a particular `--seed` and a subset of the specs (by passing a directory or file as CLI args) -- otherwise, when you start bisecting a failing test due to an ordering dependency, the order may not be consistent if you didn't pass the files or directories in the same order they were loaded originally.  If you want more fine-grained control over the order things run, [there's an API for that](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration:order_groups_and_examples).  You could probably put some logic in that API's callback that inspects `ARGV` to see what the order of files were, and orders the examples and groups accordingly.  We could potentially even add a `--order passed` that would do that for you (e.g. sets the based on the passed file/dir list).  Not sure I like the name \"passed\", though, and I don't know how widely used it would be.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/20923100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"907th","id":800362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/800362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th","html_url":"https://github.com/907th","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/907th/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-26T05:26:42Z","updated_at":"2013-11-26T05:26:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec/pull/217","id":22900875,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTAwODMzMDA=","number":217,"title":"Respect

first motivation was to force guard-rspec to use native Guard notifications settings.\nE.g. I want to use only Tmux notification with custom settings:\n\n``` ruby\n# Guardfile\nnotification :tmux, color_location: 'status-left-fg'\n```\n\nBut as you know current version of guard-rspec's formatter for RSpec uses `Guard::Notification#notify` without worrying about user notifications config (from Guardfile).\n\nSo I decided to use next strategy:\n1. Save rspec results summary in `./tmp/rspec_guard_result` file along with failed paths, and then\n2. read that summary back in Runner and show notifications from here (in running Guard, not from RSpec formatter).\n\nIt seemed not big improvement, but actually it led me to many more refactorings. This is summary:\n- Extract options management to `Guard::RSpec::Options` class.\n  Now all options are processed by `Guard::RSpec` with help of that class and then passed to Runner, Command, etc.\n- Split single `Inspector` class to subclasses `FocusedInspector`,\n  `KeepingInspector`, `SimpleInsector` with base class `Inspectors::Base`.\n  Instanciate inspector using `Inspectors::Factory` in Runner.\n  That allows us to move logic of `focus_on_failed` and `keep_failed`\n  to `FocusedInspector` and `KeepingInspector` accordingly.\n- Move all notifications code to separate class `Guard::RSpec::Notifier`.\n\nYes, I understand that there is too many modifications for single fix, but I spent several days for it and I'm sure that it was not for nothing.\n\nI tried to test all my code well and don't remove existing test cases (except when it is a clear need). So now I'm waiting for your feedback )\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/29273179","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/952#issuecomment-29273179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/952","id":29273179,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjczMTc5","user":{"login":"thibaudgg","id":1322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg","html_url":"https://github.com/thibaudgg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thibaudgg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-26T07:51:47Z","updated_at":"2013-11-26T07:51:47Z","body":"Hi @myronmarston do you think it'll be fixed in 2.x release?
