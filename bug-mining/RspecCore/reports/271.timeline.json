regressed in #1749. The changes there affected code like this:\n\n``` ruby\nRSpec.configure do |c|\n  c.include Mod, :example_group => { :file_path => /./ }\nend\n```\n\nIn RSpec 2, and in RSpec 3 before #1749, this snippet would cause `Mod`\nto be included in every example group (since `/./` matches all file\npaths). After #1749, it would _not_ be included in any example groups.\nInstead, it was included in the singleton class of every example.\nIn practice, this usually worked OK, as the methods from `Mod` were\navailable to be called very every example, but it had subtle problems:\n- If the same method was defined in multiple included modules,\n  the version of the method defined in a module included in this\n  fashion would always get precedence due to the singleton class\n  getting \"first dibs\" during method dispatch over the example group\n  class. (This is the broken example given in #2232).\n- I believe this broke `c.extend Mod, :example_group => {...}` since\n  we don't extend onto singleton classes.\n\nThe reason is that the optimizations included in #1749 considered\nonly metadata keys that the groups and examples have in their metadata\nhashes. In a group hash, `:example_group` is not a \"real\" metadata\nkey--instead it is created lazily on first access using a\n`default_proc`. But example hashes still have it (it is a reference to\nthe metadata of their group), so it allowed example filtering to work\ncorrectly, which in turn hid the bug.\n\nFixes #2232.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":646541388,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDY0NjU0MTM4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/646541388","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"84831813745d81209f0ceac8a9d4a711fcc3a2f1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/commits/84831813745d81209f0ceac8a9d4a711fcc3a2f1","created_at":"2016-04-30T14:54:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/215971414","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2232#issuecomment-215971414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2232","id":215971414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTk3MTQxNA==","user":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-30T14:54:32Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T14:54:32Z","body":"@marcandre: I've got a fix for this in #2234.
