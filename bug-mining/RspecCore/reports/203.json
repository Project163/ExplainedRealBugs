Quoting the earlier conversation from #1108:\n\n@dchelimsky:\n\n> Small matter, but I much prefer `reduce` over `inject` since that's what other languages call it.\n\n@myronmarston:\n\n> That makes sense, especially given you've been doing Clojure (which I presume calls it `reduce`).\n> \n> I have a slight preference for `inject`, but for no valid reason: it's simply what I'm used to using, and it's what I generally see in code written by other rubyists.  My instinct is to leave it as is, given that other projects I work on (especially at work) have settled on `inject` (so it helps with context shifting to keep this) but I don't care much.\n\n@dchelimsky:\n\n> I've actually been thinking of combing through all the libs to do pull requests to change `inject` to `reduce` :)\n> \n> I think it should be consistent within each lib, so if you really prefer `inject`, I'd recommend changing any `reduce`s to `inject`s. Or the other way 'round. WDYT?\n\n@myronmarston:\n\n> What do others prefer?  @alindeman @xaviershay @JonRowe @samphippen @soulcutter ?\n> \n> (I'm happy to go with whatever the consensus is).\n\n@dchelimsky:\n\n> This may help your evaluation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduce_(higher-order_function)\n> \n> Looks like most languages call it `fold`, or the more specific `foldl` and `foldr`. `reduce`, or some variant, is the 2nd most common, used in in Lisp (and variants like Clojure) and Perl, Python, Javascript, etc. The only other languages that use `inject` are Smalltalk and Groovy.\n\n@JonRowe:\n\n> I prefer `inject`, it's just been the way I've always thought of it but I'm ok with `reduce`...\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
