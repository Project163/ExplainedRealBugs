However, now it's suddenly failing for me even though I didn't change anything.\n\nSo...a few thoughts on this:\n1. If you configure RSpec to `expect_with :rspec` before referencing `RSpec::Matchers` it'll work. Or if you wait to reference RSpec::Matchers until an example group has been defined, it'll work (that's because RSpec mixes in the expectation framework at that point, and assumes you want to use rspec-expectations if you haven't yet configured something else). Or if you manually require `rspec/expectations` it'll likewise work.\n2. We could define `RSpec.const_missing` so that if `RSpec::Matchers` is referenced it requires and loads it automatically.\n\nI'm on the fence about this; on the one hand, the second option \"just works\" for end users, but I'm trying to move RSpec in the direction of less magic.  But I'm not opposed to it.  The first option is les magical, and makes everything very explicit--but it forces users to be be explicit about their use of rspec-expectations.  Overall, the rspec gems should work seamlessly together with minimal configuration effort from end users.\n\nThoughts?\n\n/cc @dchelimsky @alindeman @justinko
