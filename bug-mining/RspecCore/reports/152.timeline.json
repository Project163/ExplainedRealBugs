since i now know what the cause is its not such a big issue anymore for me. The only thing that still bothers me a bit is the before{ raise } scenario. The number of examples listed is wrong and the documentation generated is nested in a wrong way (gets worse the deeper the nesting). I use unnamed examples a lot (they have expectations, but that does not help in this scenario) and i have several before hooks that might raise (e.g. in my request specs). It would be helpful that when the name of an example can't be determined because it is unnamed and could not get executed that it uses a default name like 'unnamed example in line 1337'.
