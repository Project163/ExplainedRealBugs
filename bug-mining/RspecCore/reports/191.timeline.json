Here's a simpler example that fails:\n\n``` ruby\ndescribe Array do\n  before(:all) { subject }\n\n  describe \"Class Methods\" do\n    subject { described_class }\n    example { expect(subject).to be(Array) }\n  end\n\n  describe \"Instance Methods\" do\n    subject { described_class.new([1, 2]) }\n    example { expect(subject).to be_an(Array) }\n  end\nend\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nArray\n  Class Methods\n    should equal Array (FAILED - 1)\n  Instance Methods\n    should be a kind of Array\n\nFailures:\n\n  1) Array Class Methods \n     Failure/Error: example { expect(subject).to be(Array) }\n\n       expected #<Class:70325266257580> => Array\n            got #<Array:70325274767720> => []\n\n       Compared using equal?, which compares object identity,\n       but expected and actual are not the same object. Use\n       `expect(actual).to eq(expected)` if you don't care about\n       object identity in this example.\n\n\n       Diff:\n       @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@\n       -Array\n       +[]\n```\n\nIf you comment out the `before(:all)`, this passes.  Here's another example that uses `let` instead of `subject` and similarly fails, but passes if `before(:all)` is removed:\n\n``` ruby\ndescribe \"Let memoization\" do\n  before(:all) { foo }\n\n  let(:foo) { 5 } \n\n  describe \"Class Methods\" do\n    let(:bar) { 3 } \n    example { expect(bar).to eq(3) }\n  end \n\n  describe \"Instance Methods\" do\n    let(:bar) { 4 } \n    example { expect(bar).to eq(4) }\n  end \nend\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nLet memoization\n  group 1\n    should eq 3\n  group 2\n    should eq 4 (FAILED - 1)\n\nFailures:\n\n  1) Let memoization group 2 \n     Failure/Error: example { expect(bar).to eq(4) }\n\n       expected: 4\n            got: 3\n\n       (compared using ==)\n```\n\nThe source of the problem is that instance variables that are set by code running in `before(:all)` get stored and re-assigned for each example, and that includes the `@__memoized` variable that is used by `let` declarations.  As of 19dd6b2d4b25da0042f80bb8ff854672b913ba30 `subject` is implemented in terms of `let`, so that if `@__memoized` gets stored in `before(:all)`, these weird bugs occur.\n\nI tried the second example on rspec 2.12 and 2.11, and it fails on those versions as well, so this has been a long-standing bug in rspec.  Actually, I don't think the lifecycle of `let`-memoized objects when referenced in `before(:all)` has ever been specified.  We should decide what the behavior should be.\n\nA couple ideas:\n1. Disallow `let` methods from being called in `before(:all)`.\n2. Clear `let` memoization before every example -- which would imply that the value memoized in `before(:all)` will not be preserved for any of the examples.\n3. Allow `let` memoizations to survive for the duration of whatever scope they are first referenced in--so if a `let` declaration is first referenced in `before(:all)` it would survive for all the examples in that group.\n\nI'm leaning towards the second option, and also adding a warning (something like \"WARNING: `let` declaration `foo` referenced in `before(:all)`. The value will not be memoized since this is outside the scope of one example.\")\n\n@dchelimsky / @alindeman -- what are your thoughts here?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/14098827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":39224802,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkyMjQ4MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/39224802","actor":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-02-26T07:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":39224803,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MjI0ODAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/39224803","actor":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-02-26T07:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":39224804,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkyMjQ4MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/39224804","actor":{"login":"alindeman","id":395621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/395621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman","html_url":"https://github.com/alindeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-02-26T07:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":39224805,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MjI0ODA1","url":"https:

don't think a let should be permissible inside a `before(:all)` . There's some dissonance in allowing it in some `before` calls and not others - this leads me to think that they might belong as separate methods rather than one method that takes a symbol parameter indicating the type of hook it is. Changing method names would take a whole deprecation/removal cycle, not to mention changing something that has been baked in for so long could grate on people, so I understand if that's not really on the table here.

inner/outer subject confusion when using a named subject.\n\nThis fixes #800 while preserving the behavior we settled on in #757.  However, the complexity of supporting `super` in a named subject (look at that crazy metaprogramming I had to do!) makes me think that we should disable `super` in named subjects altogether instead.  @alindeman and I [discussed this previously](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/757#issuecomment-11770186) and decided that `super` in a named subject should super to the outer subject, not an outer `let` declaration; however, to prevent the bug reported in #800, we have to make the `let` declaration primary with the subject simply an alias to the `let`...which causes `super` to call the parent `let` method, not the parent subject.\n\nSo...I'm thinking of changing this so that it raises a `super() can't be used in a named subject` error instead.  Really, I don't think there's a good use case for supporting it.  It is a bit of a breaking change (since 2.13.0 is out with `super` calling the parent subject), and we need to get a patch release out to fix #800, so that's a bit of a problem, but I'm not sure what to do about it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/14260484","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/802#issuecomment-14260484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/802","id":14260484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjYwNDg0","user":{"login":"alindeman","id":395621,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTYyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/395621?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman","html_url":"https://github.com/alindeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-28T22:03:50Z","updated_at":"2013-02-28T22:03:50Z","body":">

discussions.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/14275327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-01T06:47:20Z","updated_at":"2013-03-10T10:24:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/500","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/500/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/500/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/500/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/500","id":2194967,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTk0OTY3","number":500,"title":"If

you invoke any `let`-defined method from a `before(:all)` block, all `let` values will be shared across all examples. [A sample](https://gist.github.com/1354150). This case is not specified one way or the other in the documentation, but the observed behavior is a bit surprising. I think a less surprising behavior would be for the `let`s to be memoized separately for `before(:all)`.\n\nThis behavior occurs in all RSpec 2.x versions (I tested all the way back to 2.0.1 and up to 2.8.0.rc1), but I can find no mention of it in the mailing list or via google, so I guess that it doesn't come up too
