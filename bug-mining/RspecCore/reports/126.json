As described here: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Hooks, cucumber has the following construct:\n\n```\nAfter do |scenario|\n  if scenario.failed?\n    #do stuff\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI have put together a monkey patch which lets me do that in rspec. The gist is here:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/1009181\n\nIt provides #passed? and #failed? methods on RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup\n\n```\nafter(:each) do\n  if failed?\n    #do stuff\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIt would be great if rspec provided something like this.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
