You use `--profile` to get a report of the slowest tests, but it sounds like you already have an idea of which tests are slowing you down.

not including profile output when there are failures was an intentional decision, not a bug:\n\nhttps://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/v2.12.2/lib/rspec/core/formatters/base_text_formatter.rb#L46-L47\n\nI traced that back through the git history to the initial import of [micronaut](https://github.com/spicycode/micronaut) into rspec-core as the basis of the spec running for rspec-2...so this behavior has been around a long time.  I've never discussed it with @spicycode or @dchelimsky, though, to get their take on why this choice was made.\n\nIf I had to guess...the reason the profile info isn't dumped when their are failures is that it clutters up the output.  The failures are the more important thing you really should be concerned about, and it would be problematic if the presence of the extra profile info caused someone to not notice that there were spec failures.  Improving spec perf is best done when your suite is green.\n\nThat said, I can remember getting annoyed at this behavior on at least one occasion and got an unexpected failure (due to the `--order random` option exposing a new unintentional ordering dependency I hadn't noticed yet), and was annoyed that the profile output was not included in the output (as it was what I was primarily interested in at the time).\n\nI'm open to the idea of changing the profiler so the info is always dumped when the `--profile` option is used, even if there are spec failures (after all, there shouldn't be any harm in giving the user more info), as long as the profile output doesn't reduce visibility into the failures--i.e. the failures should come later in the output than the profile info, I think.\n\n@dchelimsky -- are there additional factors I'm not thinking of to take into account here?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/11652678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":32822937,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI4MjI5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/32822937","actor":{"login":"spicycode","id":222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode","html_url":"https://github.com/spicycode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-12-24T01:04:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":32822938,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyODIyOTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/32822938","actor":{"login":"spicycode","id":222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode","html_url":"https://github.com/spicycode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spicycode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-12-24T01:04:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":32822939,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI4MjI5Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/32822939","actor":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-12-24T01:04:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":32822940,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyODIyOTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/r
