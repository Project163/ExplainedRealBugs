And I agree that the semantics are better.  I can't think of a case where you'd define a filter using a lambda for a particular hash key, and want the lambda to be invoked for examples that don't have that metadata hash key at all.\n\nOne thing that does concern me a bit: the removal of the arity-2 clause that passes along the metadata hash itself as an argument.  I agree it's no longer needed internally (since it was there for the awkward `:if` case), but the cat's out of the bag, so to speak, and there may be people that have filter lambdas that accept 2 arguments that rely on that.  The simple fact is that being able to receive the metadata hash itself as a second arguments makes the filtering lambdas even more powerful: you can write lambdas that interact with other metadata entries.\n\nIf you do intend to remove that, I'd prefer to see it properly deprecated with a warning.  That way, if anyone does depend on it, they'll know to change their code so it doesn't use that feature or they can report an issue explaining why they find it
