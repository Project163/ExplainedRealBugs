Except: here, the innermost describe block's definition of `post_attributes` repeats the title from the one above it.\n\nI'd prefer to say something like this:\n\n```\ncontext \"with an author\" do\n  let(:post_attributes) { super.merge( author: \"Ernest Holbrecht\" ) }\n\n  its(:description) { should == \"10 things about yak shaving you're doing wrong by Ernest Holbrecht\" }\nend\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think we can use `super`, it would have to be `super()` (which is uglier) or else we'd get the error \"Implicit argument passing of super from method defined by define_method() is not supported. Specify all arguments explicitly.\"\n\nSo this issue is here to decide two things:\n1. Is this a good thing to add to RSpec?\n2. If so, what's the right word to use to refer to the inherited value of a let?\n\nI'm happy to write the implementation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/294/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
