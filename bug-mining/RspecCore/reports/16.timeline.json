Seeing as you can't attach patches to Github tickets, have pushed a few commits to forks here:\n\n  http://github.com/wincent/rspec-core/commits/core-ticket-42\n\nAnd here:\n\n  http://github.com/wincent/rspec-rails/commits/core-ticket-42\n\nSpecifically we're talking about these commits:\n\n  http://github.com/wincent/rspec-core/commit/99f0428d53b98cee8a60250d1347224f3dbc5697\n  http://github.com/wincent/rspec-core/commit/2ed401684b68e404d75be051b932d592b260dc00\n  http://github.com/wincent/rspec-rails/commit/66c5df14c5f7e4d0f8e42f98009837077c680437\n  http://github.com/wincent/rspec-rails/commit/0c5801a412bfd3abaac5ed7222e4e1d34e4e78e7\n\nThe actual changes to the codebase were trivial (20 minutes of coding), but I've had quite a bit of trouble and spent several hours trying to keep the specs and features passing.\n\nOne of the problems is that it is quite fiddly if you make a change which requires simultaneous modifications across different repos. For example, the renaming of \"running_example\" to \"example\" in rspec-core requires changes in rspec-rails because the latter uses \"running_example\".\n\nSo you make the change in both repos at once, but you get failures in rspec-rails because it is using the system version of rspec-core rather than the local one.\n\nThe spec failures can be fixed by tweaking the Gemfile in the generated example Rails app so that it uses the local version of rspec-core instead of some other version that it might pull from elsewhere on the system. (That's what commit 0c5801a412bfd does.)\n\nIn this way you can make the change in both rspec-core and rspec-rails at the same time, and all specs keep passing.\n\nThe feature failures are another matter entirely. Cucumber insists on using some other version of rspec-core rather than the local one. I've spent hours trying to find out why, but I'm afraid I have to give up.\n\nThat in turn means I am not so confident about commit 66c5df14c5f7e. In particular I am not sure about the change to lib/rspec/rails/adapters.rb. I changed the instance variable name from @running_example to @example in the \"method_name\" method, but I don't even know what that method does, and the specs/features pass irrespective of what the instance variable is called.\n\nSo, take a look at the commits and perhaps you can see something that I can't that explains how to get Cucumber to use the right version of rspec-core.\n\nIn any case, with these commits we can do stuff like:\n\n```\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  config.before :each do\n    Capybara.current_driver = :celerity if example.options[:js]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThere is one possible further modification that I was playing around with, but it is a bit more invasive so I haven't committed anything yet.\n\nThe thing is that in a \"before :all\" block there is obviously no \"running example\" at that point, so if the user tries to do something like this they'll bomb out because \"example\" is nil at this point:\n\n```\nconfig.before :all do\n  do_something if example.options[:foo]\nend\n```\n\nAt that point we're executing within the scope of a RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup class, so if we ask for \"example\" we hit the \"example\" accessor and get nil back.\n\nNote:\n\n```\nconfig.before :all do\n  # people could do it this way, and it works...\n  do_something if self.class.metadata[:foo]\n  # but I expect lots will try \"example.options\" and fail anyway...\nend\n```\n\nThe idea I was playing with was in that context, returning a different non-nil object (probably a Metadata subclass) that responds to \"options\", and would return the user-supplied metadata passed in at the describe-block level. ie:\n\n```\ndescribe Thing, :js => true do\n  before :all do\n    example.options[:js] # => true\n  end\n\n  before :each do\n    example.options[:foo] # => defined below\n  end\n\n  it \"should behave\", :foo => true do\n  end\nend\n```\n\nSo you could define your metadata at any level, and access it at any level.\n\nNot sure if this is opening up a can of worms, though, cause then we'd have to think about how this metadata should \"trickle\" down when nesting is involved, e.g:\n\n```\ndescribe Outer, :foo => 1 do\n  describe Inner, :bar => 2 do\n    before :all do\n      # here should have access to :foo and :bar\n    end\n\n    before :each do\n      # here should have access to :foo and :bar too\n      # plus anything set at the \"its\" level\n    end\n\n    it \"should behave\", :foo => :override, :baz => 3 do\n      # here :foo => override, :bar => 2, :baz => 3\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/278916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wincent","id":7074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent","html_url":"https://github.com/wincent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/278988","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/42#issuecomment-278988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/42","id":278988,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODk4OA==","user":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-06-17T17:49:16Z","updated_at":"2010-06-17T17:49:16Z","body":"There's a lot to review in that comment and I'm pressed for time this minute, but re: the name change - we'll want to deprecate running_example as there are other consumers of that method in the wild.
