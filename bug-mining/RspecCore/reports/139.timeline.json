To monitor [Raptor](http://github.com/garybernhardt/raptor), I plot many metrics across commits, including spec runtime. I don't care about load time for this metric; I just want to know whether the specs themselves get slow.\n\nHow about this as a proposed solution to both my problem and the spork one:\n- By default, RSpec shows the spec runtime (as it was before 2.7) and the full runtime (as added in 2.7)\n- Somehow, Spork tells RSpec that it should ignore the full runtime since it doesn't make sense in that case. RSpec may be able to detect this simply based on how it's being run. For example, if Spork isn't running RSpec through its script, that should be easy to
