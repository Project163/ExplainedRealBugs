Aka, where was it included, what file was it included in, etc... There is the description 'Arel Join#each iterates over the rows in any order', but in a project with a lot of specs, that's basically useless to me.\n\n2) I would like a way to run that single spec in isolation in the context that caused it to fail. I'm not sure of how to do that right now.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/82/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
