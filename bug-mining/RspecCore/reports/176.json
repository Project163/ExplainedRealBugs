For instance my current failure happens only when I run all my controller specs, which takes more than 10 minutes.\n\nI can look at the order of the tests that ran, but if I try to run a reduced set of files I don't see the failure because the order is different.\n\nYou might be able to do something like hash the seed and the test names, sort those hashes, and run in that order, that way subsequent subset runs with the same seed will run those tests in the same order as previously.\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
