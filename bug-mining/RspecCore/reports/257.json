The new support for `aggregate_failures` gives us an alternative: if the example already has an exception and another one occurs, we can convert the exception to a `RSpec::Expectations::MultipleExpectationsNotMetError` and make both exceptions available off of that -- which will in turn be formatted nicely by the formatter.  Of course, we'd have to do this in a way that doesn't break for users who use rspec-core but not rspec-expectations.  A simple solution would be to keep the existing behavior of `RSpec::Expectations::MultipleExpectationsNotMetError` is not defined.  There are probably better solutions but that's the only I've thought of.\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1966/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
