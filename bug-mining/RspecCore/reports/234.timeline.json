this bug goes back to our change in #1653 to pass `task.pattern` on as `--pattern` to the `rspec` command.  This was had 3 benefits:\n- Fixed #1126.\n- Made the generated rake task command far less verbose.\n- Centralized the pattern handling at one place (as handled by `rspec`) which should help make things more consistent.\n\nHowever, as we've seen, the rake task's `pattern` option apparently supported lots of stuff we had no idea it supported, and we've been addressing those bug reports have come in.  There are two primary reasons for the mismatch:\n- The old implementation used `FileList[task.pattern]`, and `FileList` is extremely flexible, supporting all sorts of things like an array of files, an array of directories, a `FileList` object, etc...where as we expected `task.pattern` to be a file glob pattern (as that's all that `rspec --pattern` supports).\n- The pattern options for the rake task vs `rspec` command have different semantics.  For the rake task, it's meant to be resolved as a file glob to match a list of files.   For the `rspec` command, it's meant to specify a relative file glob that when combined with one or more directories passed at the command line, will match a list of files.  The default `rspec` pattern is `'**{,/*/**}/*_spec.rb'`, which, as you can see, matches any `_spec.rb` file.  You run a command like `rspec spec/unit` and it makes a pattern like `'spec/unit/**{,/*/**}/*_spec.rb'` internally and uses that to find matching files.  Bare `rspec` provides `spec` as the default path.\n\nIn this case, @gavinheavyside has chosen to put his acceptance specs in side directory from `spec` rather than under `spec`.  This is a bit non-standard, and has some possible issues/complexities (e.g. `spec` gets put on the load path but `acceptance` will not), but it's definitely something we should support, not least because it worked before 3.1.  `t.pattern = \"acceptance/**/*_spec.rb\"` works with the old way the rake task pattern handling worked (since `FileList['acceptance/**/*_spec.rb']` found all matching files), but not the new way.  The `rspec` command tries to turn this into `spec/acceptance/**/*_spec.rb` (since `spec` is the default path), and it finds no files.\n\nOn the surface, it seems like this should be an easy fix: we could change the pattern handling for `rspec` to also try resolving the pattern with no path prefix, but we can't generally do this.  Consider the default pattern of `'**{,/*/**}/*_spec.rb'`.  If you pass this to `Dir[]`, and you have some vendored gems that use rspec for testing, it'll match spec files in those vendored gems as well...which is certainly not what you want!  In general, I haven't thought of a safe way to treat a `--pattern` option passed to `rspec` as a stand-alone relative file path glob.\n\nReally, the `rspec` command that runs what @gavinheavyside wants to run is `rspec acceptance`, and he could achieve that with a rake task definitions like:\n\n``` ruby\n  RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:acceptance) do |t|\n    t.rspec_opts = %w[acceptance --color]\n    t.pattern = \"**/*_spec.rb\"\n  end\n```\n\n...but that doesn't help us fix the bug.\n\nI'm not sure what the best fix for the bug is.  All the things I've thought of have serious downsides :(.\n- We could change `rspec --pattern` to try to resolve the pattern as a relative path (with no extra path prefix), but as I said above, this is likely to pick up spec files from vendored gems, which is a big problem. We may be able to come up with a heuristic about when it is safe to treat pattern this way (e.g. if it starts with a path segment that is a directory under the current working directory) but I dislike having it treat the pattern as a relative file glob only sometimes.  That's likely to surprise people.\n- We could change `task.pattern` to try to split path and pattern pieces out of the provided patern and pass them along in the form I showed above...but again, that feels hacky and error prone.  I don't have a lot of confidence in us doing it right.\n- As we've seen, the semantics of the two pattern options are different, so we could revert our change that tried to unify them.  This would bring back the bug we were fixing by switching to that (so we'd have to fix it another way), and it may have some repurcussions I'm not thinking of (now that this new way has been out for a month or so -- there may be new cases that work that reverting would break!).\n- We could treat patterns-with-a-path-prefix-besides-spec as a special case and resolve them using `FileList`.\n- Are there other possible fixes I'm not thinking of?\n\nThoughts from others?\n\n/cc @rspec/rspec

It'd fix these issues by restoring the old behaviour no?\n\nNope.  The problem isn't that `FileList` will find files that our `Dir[]` globbing won't; the problem is that the semantics of the two pattern options is different.\n\n> Why do we support `--pattern`? I've always just done `rspec spec/acceptance` to run a subset, or if really needed `rspec spec/acceptance/**/*_spec.rb` and let shell expansion deal with it.\n\nFor `rspec some/path` to work, RSpec has to know which files under `some/path` to load.  `--pattern` is the mans it uses to do that.  The recommended convention is to name your files `xyz_spec.rb` -- but that's just a convention.  Generally, for things that are just conventions (and could just have easily have a different config value), we expose options to change the convention for users who want to do that.  For example, some users may want to name their spec files `xyz.spec`.  Some tools like [turnip](https://github.com/jnicklas/turnip) change the pattern for their needs.\n\nAfter thinking on it some more, I'm leaning towards the 1st solution I mentioned above, with a heuristic that if the pattern's first path segment is `**` then we don't resolve it relative to the working directory (but in all other cases we do).  I _think_ this will be safe (as `**` is really the only starting prefix that can cause vendored specs to be picked up, I think) and will generally do the right thing, even if it's not 100% consistent.  (When it's inconsistent, it is so for good reason).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/57955639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":174909548,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NDkwOTU0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/174909548","actor":{"login":"etiennebarrie","id":3535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie","html_url":"https://github.com/etiennebarrie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"04db202611355ef786865be45c31b6b3777866cd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tigerlily/redisse/commits/04db202611355ef786865be45c31b6b3777866cd","created_at":"2014-10-07T02:37:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":174923587,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NDkyMzU4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/174923587","actor":{"login":"etiennebarrie","id":3535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie","html_url":"https://github.com/etiennebarrie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etiennebarrie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e769350f055dc09ee230961ec8f7520db19b2728","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tigerlily/redisse/commits/e769350f055dc09ee230961ec8f7520db19b2728","created_at":"2014-10-07T03:42:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":175568680,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NTU2ODY4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/175568680","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.githu

directory.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/109995596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tmertens","id":2243386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDMzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2243386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens","html_url":"https://github.com/tmertens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":325236946,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1MjM2OTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/325236946","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-08T13:27:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":325236948,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTIzNjk0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/325236948","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-08T13:27:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/110023138","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1728#issuecomment-110023138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1728","id":110023138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDAyMzEzOA==","user":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_ad

-- I believe your problem is the `--default-path` option:\n\nhttps://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-2/docs/configuration/setting-the-default-spec-path\n\nSince you haven't passed a path to `rspec` the default `--default-path` is used, which means that your command is equivalent to:\n\n```\nbundle exec rspec spec --exclude-pattern \"**/acceptance/**/*_spec.rb\" --pattern \"**/*_spec.rb\"\n```\n\n...which runs only the tests in the `spec` directory, naturally.  The solution is to always pass a path at the command line:\n\n```\nbundle exec rspec . --exclude-pattern \"**/acceptance/**/*_spec.rb\" --pattern \"**/*_spec.rb\"\n```\n\n...or add an option to `.rspec`:\n\n```\n--default-path .\n```\n\nThat should fix the problem for you.  Note that using `.` as the default path may have the unintended side effect of running specs from the libraries you use, if they get installed in a subdirectory of the project root (which is what `bundle install --standalone --binstubs` would do).  Is there any reason you don't want to move the `regression_tests` directory into `spec`?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/110023138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":325332282,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI1MzMyMjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/325332282","actor":{"login":"tmertens","id":2243386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDMzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2243386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens","html_url":"https://github.com/tmertens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-08T14:51:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":325332283,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNTMzMjI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/325332283","actor":{"login":"tmertens","id":2243386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDMzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2243386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens","html_url":"https://github.com/tmertens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmertens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-08T14:51:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
