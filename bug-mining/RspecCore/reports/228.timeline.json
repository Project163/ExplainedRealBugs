there,\n\nI've just started using `VCR` again today for my feature specs. I've already got a whole list of stubs created with `WebMock` that I already use for my unit tests so I can easily control the data in order to test edge cases. I'm struggling to turn off `VCR` for those tests though.\n\nHere's what I'm trying:\n\nIn `spec_helper`:\n\n```\n  config.before do |example|\n    unless example.metadata.key?(:vcr)\n      VCR.turn_off!(:ignore_cassettes => true)\n    end\n```\n\nI've also tried `config.around` too, but that weirdly makes all my specs pass crazy fast regardless of correctness.\n\nThen I call `VCR.turn_on!` in the feature spec, which runs perfectly fine:\n\n```\nrequire \"spec_helper\"\n\nVCR.turn_on!\nvcr_options = { record: :new_episodes }\nfeature \"Visitor signs in\", vcr: vcr_options do\n  scenario \"with valid email and password\" do\n    visit(sign_in_path)\n    sign_in_as_admin\n\n    user_is_signed_in\n  end\n  ...\n```\n\nBut then I get an error when the full suite run hits a unit spec. The stack trace I get from hitting, say for example, a Controller spec is something like:\n\n```\n1) PostsController POST #create invalid attributes renders @post.errors as text\n     Failure/Error: sign_in_as(build_stubbed(:admin))\n     ArgumentError:\n       VCR::Response initialized with an invalid body: {\"access_token\"=>\"abcdef\", \"token_type\"=>\"bearer\", \"expires_in\"=>7200, \"refresh_token\"=>nil, \"scope\"=>\"\"}.\n     # ./spec/controllers/posts_controller_spec.rb:5:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'\n```\n\nThe above is the content of the `WebMock` stub I've hand-rolled for authenticating in my controller specs.\n\nAny pointers would be great as I really want to use VCR to remove the knowledge of data sources in my acceptance tests.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vcr/vcr/issues/427/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vcr/vcr/issues/427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":146571149,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE0NjU3MTE0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/146571149","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-29T05:38:37Z","milestone":{"title":"3.1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":146571178,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE0NjU3MTE3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/146571178","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-29T05:38:48Z","label":{"name":"small","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/51809706","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1582#issuecomment-51809706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1582","id":51809706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODA5NzA2","user":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-11T17:10:23Z","updated_at":"2014-08-11T17:10:23Z","body":"I'm
