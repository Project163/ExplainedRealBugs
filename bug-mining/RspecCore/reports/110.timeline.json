Looks like Elliot didn't read documentation carefully or just expected rspec 1.x behaviour which doesn't support regexp patterns for --example.

More over all people how used regexp patterns here need to fix their scripts/runners/etc due to new Regexp.escape. So let's decide which behaviour we need here.

I don't know what David meant by \"pattern\", although the help text goes on to say that the pattern is compiled into a regexp, which could be taken to mean that it isn't necessarily a regexp. I agree it probably wouldn't hurt to clarify that regexp characters will be escaped, if people are used to that, but I don't really know.\n\nIn any case, I still think the argument to --example should be regexp-escaped, as I think that's what people are going to expect. I mean, when you use --example, do you think to yourself, \"Well, this is a regexp, so I need to make sure to escape special characters\", or do you think \"I want to run examples that contain this string\"? My guess is, it's the latter... at least, it is for me. And yes, it didn't come to mind, but I guess I _was_ expecting 1.x behavior. \n\nI'm not discounting your backward compatibility argument, though -- what if you really do want to pass a regexp to --example?
