For example, I have methods in my `ApplicationController` and I specify their behavior in shared example groups which I then included in the subclasses, but then I find it difficult to name the group and wind up with a bunch of declarations like:\n\n```\nit_should_behave_like \"(some aspect of) ApplicationController\" # or\nit_should_behave_like \"ApplicationController (some method name)\"\n```\n\nWhat do you think of providing one alias that allows us to labelled shared examples as abstract behaviors rather than concrete things. For example, `it_has_behavior`.\n\nThen I could write things like:\n\n```\nit_has_behavior 'taggability' # or 'tagging', if you prefer\nit_has_behavior 'sortability' # or 'sorting, if you prefer\nit_has_behavior 'versioning'\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\nit_should_behave_like 'a taggable model'\nit_should_behave_like 'a commentable model'\nit_should_behave_like 'a versioned model'\n```\n\nAt least for me, the former is preferable, and in line with the trend to write out examples without the \"should\"; ie:\n\n```\nit 'does something'\n```\n\nRather than\n\n```\nit 'should do something'\n```\n\nWhat do you think?\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
