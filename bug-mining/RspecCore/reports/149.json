From my understanding it should only be run once in both.\n\nEDIT: \nSeems like the 'its' is not the root cause. The cause is nesting another describe-block inside a describe block that uses a shared context:\n\n``` ruby\n    describe 'shared context and its' do\n        shared_context :shared => :ctx do\n            before{ puts 'before';raise if @x; @x = true }\n        end\n\n        describe 'outer', :shared => :ctx do\n            it(:ok){}\n            describe 'inner' do\n                it{ :fails }\n            end\n        end\n    end\n```\n\nEDIT 2:\nThis only seems to happen when using meta-data to use the context. When using include_context the example passes.\n\nEDIT 3: rspec version: 2.8.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/576/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
