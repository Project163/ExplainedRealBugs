looks like the [performance improvements mentioned on the JRuby blog](http://blog.jruby.org/2015/10/performance_improvements_in_jruby_9030/) probably broke exception backtrace generation in some cases.  This affected RSpec, causing the following bug: https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2299.  I can reproduce the problem by running this very simple script in JRuby:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbegin\r\n  raise\r\nrescue ArgumentError\r\nrescue StandardError => e\r\n  if e.backtrace.nil?\r\n    puts \"Rescued an exception with no backtrace!\"\r\n  else\r\n    puts \"Looks good\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a shell session showing my environment and the output of that script:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jruby -v\r\njruby 9.1.7.0 (2.3.1) 2017-01-11 68056ae Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 25.121-b13 on 1.8.0_121-b13 +jit [mswin32-x86_64]\r\n$ uname -a\r\nMINGW64_NT-10.0

same script.\r\n\r\nFor anyone affected by this, a workaround is to add `=> _` to the first rescue statement.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jruby/jruby/issues/4467/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jruby/jruby/issues/4467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":942556562,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk0MjU1NjU2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/942556562","actor":{"login":"DavidEGrayson","id":466764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njc2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/466764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidEGrayson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"42f3a4c81ff28567d0646a995b2929edb0d5d8ed","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DavidEGrayson/rspec-core/commits/42f3a4c81ff28567d0646a995b2929edb0d5d8ed","created_at":"2017-01-31T06:16:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"DavidEGrayson","id":466764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Njc2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/466764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidEGrayson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidEGrayson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-31T06:18:08Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T06:18:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2381","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2381/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2381/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2381/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/2381","id":204213604,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTAzODc4MTA0","number":2381,"title":"Fix
