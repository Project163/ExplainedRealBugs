When executing `rake rcov` on the other hand \nthen this will be the output: \n\n```\nC:\\Users\\jarmo\\Desktop\\minu\\projects\\Ruby\\blah>rake rcov \n(in C:/Users/jarmo/Desktop/minu/projects/Ruby/blah) \nc:/ruby/bin/ruby.exe -S rcov -Ispec \"./spec/my_lib_spec.rb\" \n./spec/my_lib_spec.rb:1: undefined method `describe' for main:Object \n(NoMethodError) \n        from c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rcov-0.9.8/bin/rcov:511:in \n`load' \n        from c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rcov-0.9.8/bin/rcov:511 \n        from c:/ruby/bin/rcov:19:in `load' \n        from c:/ruby/bin/rcov:19 \nrake aborted! \nruby -S rcov -Ispec \"./spec/my_lib_spec.rb\" failed \n```\n\nIt will pass of course if i'll add `require \"rspec\"` to somewhere.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
