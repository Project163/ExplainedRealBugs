For example, for [this deprecation](ec-core/blob/91e807ac1f5fdf43ef3815210669a7f5e4b941a1/lib/rspec/core/example_group.rb#L531-L551), the \"Called from\" bit looks like it belongs with the next deprecation warning because of the blank line.\n\nFor warnings like these, we should add `\"-\" * 80` (or some similar separator) in order to prevent confusion.  Ideally, rspec-core would add these automatically for multiline warnings.\n\nSome warnings have these added manually ([example](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/blob/b447ee4f6c6eee2fa6072a3cf2859e682eb92468/lib/rspec/expectations/handler.rb#L103-L108)), so part of this issue is doing an audit of the other repos (both 2.99 and master) and removing the manually added fenceposts.\n","closed_by":{"login":"xaviershay","id":1714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay","html_url":"https://github.com/xaviershay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
