This is directly related to bug\nhttp://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8059.  It seems to affect Ruby 1.9.3\nbut not Ruby 2.0.0. As per the notes, it is a heisenbug, so simply\nlooking at it causes the bug to disappear.\n\nForce the call to super to make sure the let block is not passed

doing a customized deep clone, I ran across a situation where the test will fail unless the variable assigned by `let` is called first (see the spec code below).\n\nThe cloning _does_ work, but the normal test case fails.\n\nCode to reproduce:\n\nFile: `cloner.rb`\n\n``` ruby\nclass Cloner\n  def clone_array_of_hashes(a)\n    a.map{|h| h.clone}\n  end\nend\n```\n\nFile: `cloner_spec.rb`\n\n``` ruby\nrequire_relative \"./cloner\"\n\ndescribe Cloner do\n  let(:cloner) {Cloner.new}\n  let(:orig_ah) { [{a: \"A\"},{b: \"B\"}] }\n  let(:cloned_ah) { cloner.clone_array_of_hashes(orig_ah) }\n\n  it \"passes\" do\n    cloned_ah[0] #this is the only difference between the two tests\n    orig_ah[0][:a] = \"AA\"\n    expect(orig_ah[0]).to_not eq(cloned_ah[0])\n  end\n\n  it \"fails but should pass\" do\n    orig_ah[0][:a] = \"AA\"\n    expect(orig_ah[0]).to_not eq(cloned_ah[0])\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNotes:\n- Invoking `cloned_ah` instaed of `cloned_ah[0]` works to pass the test as well.\n- The issue exists whether `clone` or `dup` is used\n\nThe issue occurs with RSpec  2.14 and 2.12, and Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.0.0\n\nI had a similar issue a while ago with regexes (https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/820) with the variable needing to be invoked first, but I'm not sure if the similarities extend beyond that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5420685538,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAOlfM4As92uzwAAAAFDGRji","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/5420685538","actor":{"login":"yujinakayama","id":83656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama","html_url":"https://github.com/yujinakayama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yujinakayama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1096cf343a9f6356df1d89053bac4673dfa55102","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yujinakayama/rspec-monorepo/commits/1096cf343a9f6356df1d89053bac4673dfa55102","created_at":"2021-10-06T14:30:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
