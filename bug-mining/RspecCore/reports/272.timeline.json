RSpec is a DSL, so you have an API where e.g. Minitest would needs hacks and plugins.\n\n(Users with more of a \"minitest mindset\" will shudder at the mere thought of \"order dependency\", so they'll see an option for ordering as evil to begin with).\n\nConsistency is irrelevant if we go back to the database analogy: a database can return records \"unsorted\" - in the order they happen to be on the database. Meanwhile, users want them sorted in some meaningful way. (Or, at least, to show the same order when the page/view/table is refreshed).\n\nIt's up to the user (or developer) to decide what to sort by. And this is usually convenient.\n\nHere, in RSpec, sorting alphabetically just solved the \"inconsistency\" issue. A filename is basically a unique key (it's guaranteed to be unique), like a primary key in the database. So it's like sorting a database by primary key. Consistent, but not too practical.\n\nWhat if I wanted to sort by file size? There is a `file_path` method, but it isn't clearly documented, except mentioned here: https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/3-4/docs/formatters/json-formatter.\n\nMy point here is: if RSpec is like a database, then the API/documentation should easily map to \"queries\" and \"tables\" and \"columns\". E.g. if RSpec was a database, then there would be a \"schema\" somewhere mentioning `file_path`. And other \"fields\" that could be used during filtering/ordering.\n\n`fail_fast` is pretty much like `limit(1)` in SQL. So it's part of a \"query\" too. `profile` is pretty much like an `analyze` statement.\n\n> and you can filter on the metadata\n\nMy favorite being: `c.filter_run_including :focus => ENV['CI'] != 'true'` (don't filter on Travis, etc.).\n\n> One off runs should be configured via the command line, whilst general project settings are configured via files.\n\nAnd that's exactly what should be \"suggested\" to users: to use the command line only for one-off changes (e.g. filtering based on things like `:focus`, `:wip`, a given file/line, reproducing a build error with a given seed, etc.).\n\nGiven what you said, I think it's a \"design flaw\" to map the configuration to match the command line arguments - instead of making both the configuration and command line arguments map to \"building a query of examples to run\".\n\nBecause the RSpec configuration is not really for \"configuring RSpec\" or \"selecting files\" but for \"building a query\".\n\nOverall, I'm suggesting there is a clearer and more powerful way of structuring the documentation and a better \"mindset\" for using RSpec effectively. One that isn't at all apparent.\n\nRSpec simply has a lot more in common with a tool like PostgreSQL `psql` tool (in how it queries and formats output) than Unix tools like `find` or `tar` or `rsync` (which have exclusion/inclusion patterns, matching, filtering, etc. based on files). E.g. \"backtrace filtering\" is pretty much just formatting output. Just like `psql` has an ascii vs html mode.\n\nWhich explains my initial confusion and I didn't \"get\" how ordering works and why it's designed this way. \n\nThe whole \"query building\" is in bits and pieces (ordering, pattern matching, filtering, limiting, metadata) because it's designed to map to command-line options. (Meanwhile `psql` just allows you to enter a \"query\" on the command-line directly - kind of like what RSpec configuration is actually for).\n\nI'm not suggesting allowing Ruby code directly in command line options for RSpec - but I am suggesting not letting the configuring be rigidly limited by what's available on the command-line.\n\nAnyway, time to stop ranting and get back to work...\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/222445669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"e2","id":150197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2","html_url":"https://github.com/e2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/222557134","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2247#issuecomment-222557134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2247","id":222557134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjU1NzEzNA==","user":{"login":"e2","id":150197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2","html_url":"https://github.com/e2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/e2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-30T21:34:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-30T21:35:11Z","body":"For
