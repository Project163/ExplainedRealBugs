PR addresses a bunch of deficiencies I found in how rspec-core handles `aggregate_failures`.  This includes a fix for #1966, although the bigger fix is for how it handles a case like this:\n\n``` ruby\nit \"has failures\", :aggregate_failures do\n  expect(x).to eq(2)\n\n  raise_if_x_is_not_2(x)\nend\n```\n\nPreviously, the error from the last method call was reported as the example's main exception and the `expect(x).to eq(2)` failure was reported using a \"An error occurred in an `around` hook\" message, which was confusing and generally a bad experience.  The problem was that `aggregate_failures` handles any exceptions that happen within the block, but when using metadata it wraps rspec-core's handling of errors so the failure aggregator doesn't see the error that happens.  I had to change how we handle `aggregate_failures` a bit to deal with this.\n\nI also introduced a `RSpec::Core::MultipleExceptionError` to more generally handle multiple exceptions for one example.\n\nFinally, `pending` interacted weirdly with `aggregate_failures` so I dealt with that, too.\n\nNote that this builds on top of rspec/rspec-expectations#800.\n\nI'm hoping to release 3.3 once this is merged.\n\n/cc @rspec/rspec \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":325490396,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI1NDkwMzk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/325490396","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"909487698a5aff5619db3693c230ad85cd5d34fb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/commits/909487698a5aff5619db3693c230ad85cd5d34fb","created_at":"2015-06-08T17:07:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3941611400,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5NDE2MTE0MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/3941611400","actor":{"login":"MatheusRich","id":20938712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTM4NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20938712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich","html_url":"https://github.com/MatheusRich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b6067e1900f92926585cd5e21419758bf4967bbd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MatheusRich/rspec-core/commits/b6067e1900f92926585cd5e21419758bf4967bbd","created_at":"2020-10-30T14:51:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
