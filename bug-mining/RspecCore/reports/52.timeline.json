It _is_ the global state, so it need not maintain global state internally.  There is no programmatic benefit for defaults to be stored at the class level in `Configuration`, yet they are, and the fact that they are reduces testability by bleeding global state across examples that use other instances of `Configuration`.\n\n\"I think its current design suits its purpose very well. Changing the implementation just to support the RSpec spec suite is \"meh\".\"\n\nThis is a debate that has been present in the TDD community for a decade by now. Testability is a value, just like any other in software. To the extent that code introduces testability problems, it fails to serve its purpose. That doesn't mean you should do absurd shit to make code testable, or compromise an object's ability to perform its runtime responsibilities to the application it lives in. It's all about balance and trade-offs. But if two designs serve the needs of the app equally well, and one is more testable than the other, the more testable design wins.\n\nWhat I'd like to do in this case, is this: when assigning default values to a setting (which should happen the first time a setting is requested and it hasn't yet been set), if the value is a data structure like an Array or a Hash, a copy should be made and assigned to the setting for that instance. This way other instances won't be accessing the same Array or Hash object as the global one.
