Something like this:\n\n```\n let(:my_matcher) { /RegexWithCapture(\\d)/ }\n```\n\nThen it fails in the `it` block when I actually try to use `my_matcher`\n\n```\n \"RegexWithCapture7\".match(my_matcher)[1].should == 7  \n #=> fails\n #=> NoMethodError:  undefined method `[]' for /RegexWithCapture(\\d)$/:Regexp\n```\n\nBut!, If I invoke the matcher prior to using it, everything works as I'd expect.\n\n```\nmy_matcher  #just invoking it does the trick\n\"RegexWithCapture7\".match(my_matcher)[1].should == 7  \n #=> passes\n```\n\nI haven't tested the above code, I'm just using it to explain the problem but the stackoverflow question has an actual reproducible case.  Here's a Gist with the same code as the SO question: https://gist.github.com/forforf/5112445 it's a bit easier to read.\n\nI'm really curious why the behavior changes by just invoking the let variable.\n\nRuby 1.9.3 & RSpec 2.13.0 fwiw.\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
