I think it ought to. \n\nI could prepare a PR, but I'm not really sure the right/desired way to handle this. \n\nI guess rspec could make sure to include/extend RSpec::Core::Pending in _after_ whatever is specified in `expect_with`, to make sure rspec-core's own `skip` \"wins\" in the call chain. \n\nOr, perhaps it's okay this doesn't work, you still can skip by declaring the example with skip metadata instead -- `it \"skips\", :skip => true`.  Maybe that's good enough. But I just thought of/discovered the metadata-based skip just now writing this issue, after some hours of trying to figure out what was going on and why and how to get skip to work -- perhaps it should be mentioned in the docs somewhere around `expect_with :minitest`. \n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
