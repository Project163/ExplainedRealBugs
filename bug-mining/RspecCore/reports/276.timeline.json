Having all specs pass but the suite fail due to an `after(:all)` hook failure is a bit weird.\n- If teardown/cleanup logic encounters a failure, it's not clear that what you want is a failure, anyway.  For example: if you're `after(:all)` hook tries to delete a temporary log file, and fails...do you care enough to make it fail your suite?\n- Given that `after(:all)` hook failures don't currently cause a suite failure, and that for some users, having the suite fail would be undesirable, making this change now would be a breaking change.  We could make this change in RSpec 4, though.\n\nThoughts?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/146906696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/147138402","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2084#issuecomment-147138402","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2084","id":147138402,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NzEzODQwMg==","user":{"login":"xam7247","id":5365467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjU0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5365467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247","html_url":"https://github.com/xam7247","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xam7247/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-11T00:11:16Z","updated_at":"2015-10-11T00:11:16Z","body":"Thanks @myronmarston . That's what I thought that this is by design.  \n\nMy opinion is that it should be consistent. If the before(:all) hook(s) fail the process, so should after(:all). And if any part of the process fails - be it trivial creation / deletion of temp files, it should exit with status 1. \n\nThe issue this current behaviour causes is that it makes a build job (say: hudson) pass even when the teardown has failed. And our teardown does a crucial task - reverting application flags to pre-test state.  Hence, we missed to identify a potential problem in our test setup for quite a while, since the tests kept passing and further builds proceeded without a red herring. Rather undesirable :(\n\nWould greatly appreciate if this is updated in RSpec4.

we just allowed the error to propagate to the user, which was a subpar experience for a few reasons:\n- The error would cause RSpec to crash, leading to a long stack trace containing lots of extraneous info the user did not see.\n- The error was not formatted nicely like other errors that happen while RSpec runs.\n- If the error happened in an `after(:suite)` hook, the test suite had finished running all specs but the summary of the results would not get printed since RSpec had crashed.\n\nNow, we handle errors in :suite hooks and format the output the same way failures and errors are normally printed.\n\nNotes/open questions:\n- The first 4 commits are refactoring commits that pave the way for this change.  If desired, I can put those into a separate PR so it can be reviewed and merged separately, then this PR can be rebased on top. (Whoever reviews this, please let me know if you'd like me to do that).\n- There are a few other things I'm thinking of giving this kind of treatment:\n  - Errors raised while loading spec files: instead of crashing RSpec, have it print a nice failure like we do here.\n  - Errors raised in `after(:context)` hooks.  Right now the output for these is not nice.  If we have errors there notify via the new reporter method I've added in this PR, it'll solve #2084 w/o the introduction of a config option as discussed there.  It could be considered a breaking change, though, although it would be reasonable to consider it a bug that RSpec exits with 0 when all specs pass and an `after(:context)` hook fails.\n- I decided to hold off on these additional changes for now -- they can be in later PRs.\n- The changes here (and in any followup PRs for `after(:context)` and load-time errors) are a bit ambiguous in terms of SemVer.  I could see an argument for treating them as bug fixes (e.g. RSpec didn't handle errors in these situations properly before, allowing them to crash RSpec) or as enhancements (we're improving error reporting in these situations) or as a breaking change (in the case of `after(:context)` -- it's a situation where the suite for some users currently passes but would be reported as failing if we make that change).  For now I put this as a bug fix in the changelog.\n- This change was prompted by running into this for the new RSpec book I'm working on, and I need this in a release before the book is done (but not necessarily the changes for `after(:context` and load-time errors).  It'd be nice to get this in 3.5.x so I can update the book to take advantage right away, instead of waiting for 3.6.\n\n/cc @rspec/rspec
