I am not sure how `undef` in the module definition ended up erasing rspec-core's skip too maybe?  Weird, I don't fully understand how `undef` works. \n\nTried `undef_method :skip`, does the same thing as `undef skip` did -- `skip` is now entirely unavailable in my example. \n\nI also tried `remove_method`, no dice, that appears to only work if you call it on the actual module you want to remove it from, not a subclass/including module: `minitest_assertions_adapter.rb:27:in remove_method: method skip not defined in RSpec::Core::MinitestAssertionsAdapter (NameError)`\n\nI am getting confused and not sure what's going on or best way to proceed. i did confirm that [Minitest::Assertions, at least in master, does include the skip definition](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/1a304a03ea434fda7c6932312cbf2a9ef1c668cc/lib/minitest/assertions.rb#L649).  (It can sometimes be difficult to tell exactly what version of minitest you are using and where the canonical source is, with the minitest/stdlib issue). \n\nThe current Rspec::Core::Pending#skip method does not seem to rely on any current object state (it uses global (or thread local? whatever) `RSpec.current_example`. So, okay, this solution _works_, but it sure smells bad....\n\n``` ruby\n# in Rspec::Core::Pending\nmodule_function :skip\n\n# in Rspec::Core::MinitestAssertionsAdapter\ndef skip(*args)\n    Rspec::Core::Pending.skip(*args)\nend\n```\n\nI did test that and it made my demo case work properly.

I thought it would but it doesn't quite work how I expected.\n\nInstead, you can use this:\n\n``` ruby\nMinitest::Assertions.__send__(:remove_method, :skip)\n```\n\n...which removes the method entirely.  However, that has the side effect of mucking with minitest when we'd really just like to prevent their `skip` method from being invoked when uses put `skip` in an example.  So an alternate fix that's slightly more complicated but probably better is:\n\n``` ruby\nRSPEC_SKIP_IMPLEMENTATION = ::RSpec::Core::Pending.instance_method(:skip)\n\ndef skip(*args)\n  RSPEC_SKIP_IMPLEMENTATION.bind(self).call(*args)\nend\n```\n\nAs for testing it, you can update this cucumber scenario so that it has an example that calls `skip` and then you can assert that the output mentions a pending example:\n\nhttps://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/d38aed4244942b26cdfd821d67600a78c1f81d8e/features/expectation_framework_integration/configure_expectation_framework.feature#L74-L101\n\nWe generally like to rely on the specs (rather than cukes) as much as possible to catch regressions since the spec suite is so much faster (I personally never run the cukes unless I specifically am working with them or know a change will break some cukes), so it would be nice to have a spec for this as well, but I'd say that if that's difficult, the cuke is probably sufficient.  If you go the spec route, you could define an alternate `skip` implementation in the fake `Minitest::Assertions` module that you found, so that it mirrors the one that Minitest has.  Alternately, you could write a more integration-style test that doesn't fake out the minitest module, but in that case you should probably use `in_sub_process` (available from `RSpec::Support::InSubProcess` -- search the specs and you'll find it) as that will help to isolate the specs that load minitest for real.  We don't want a spec loading that and \"leaking\" it into other specs.\n\nLet me know if you need more guidance, and thanks for being willing to roll-up your sleeves and
