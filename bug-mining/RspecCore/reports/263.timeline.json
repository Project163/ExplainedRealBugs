They are a code smell that hides the fact that a file is being loaded twice when it shouldn't be. Far better to restructure your requires/load_path so that the file isn't loaded twice.\n\nWhat concrete problem are you having?  Are you getting a warning from Ruby about this constant?  As far as I can see, this constant is only defined in one place in our code base so it shouldn't cause any warnings unless the file is loaded twice, but that generally shouldn't happen with how we've structured things.  If it is, I'd like to get some repro steps from you so we can address it.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/150677098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/151203699","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2099#issuecomment-151203699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2099","id":151203699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTIwMzY5OQ==","user":{"login":"bitcababy","id":295549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTU0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy","html_url":"https://github.com/bitcababy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitcababy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-26T16:41:59Z","updated_at":"2015-10-26T16:41:59Z","body":"Yeah, I'm getting complaints.
