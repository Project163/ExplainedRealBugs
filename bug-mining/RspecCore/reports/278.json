For certain recurring expectations we have shared examples for which a log output looks like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"description\" : \"raises an error\",\n  \"full_description\" : \"ClassUnderTest raises an error if we expect that\",\n  \"status\" : \"passed\",\n  \"file_path\" : \"./spec/models/shared_examples/generic_examples.rb\",\n  \"line_number\" : 11,\n  \"run_time\" : 0.135449016,\n   \"pending_message\" : null\n}\n```\n\nIf we aggregate that (actually we use a feature of our CI platform for this) then we have the result that the file `./spec/models/shared_examples/generic_examples.rb` run for 4.2 minutes in total which is not actually useful information.\nSo my question, it is is possible, or feature request other wise would be: Is it possible to log the file path of the including file or let's better say the top level spec file which uses the shared examples (as it could be the case that shared examples make use of other shared examples)?\nOr is there somehow useful conclusion to be drawn from aggregated runtime information about shared examples which I did not see yet?\n","closed_by":{"login":"xaviershay","id":1714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay","html_url":"https://github.com/xaviershay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
