- Add a new config.include_context API that is similar to config.include but is for shared contexts. This would solve the \"no obvious way to auto-include a shared group everywhere\" issue mentioned above and provide a sister API to config.include for consistency.\n\nI like this idea, I use `config.include` stuff a lot and this would just be one more nicety in defining it.\n\n> - Stop using the metadata passed to shared_context as a means to determine which example groups should have the context auto-included, instead allowing it the metadata to get applied to including example groups.\n> \n> This is a breaking change and either has to wait until RSpec 4 or we have to add a config option. I lean towards the latter -- something like `config.use_shared_example_group_metadata_for_auto_inclusion = true` (although that is a bit ambiguous -- the `config.include_context` API would still use it for auto-inclusion -- maybe someone has a better idea?)\n\nI'm fine with this, it's similar to how we changed the metadata symbol means true stuff in RSpec 2 -> 3. How about make the config option a \"behaviour\" rather than a on / off flag? `config.shared_context_metadata_behaviour = :included_in_examples` or `config.shared_context_metadata_behaviour =

have the following use case:\n\nCookies are generally cleared after each example in integration tests that use browser. It's done to prevent state leakage between tests.\n\nBut I think it would be good to give possibility to not clear state between scenarios inside some context and clear state only after context. Small illustration:\n\n``` ruby\nfeature 'some feature' do\n  before(:all) do\n    create_user\n    create_some_data_for_user\n  end\n\n  before(:each) do\n    login\n    load_page_with_that_data\n  end\n\n  scenario '1' { do_action_1_with_that_data_without_changing_it }\n  scenario '2' { do_action_2_with_that_data_without_changing_it }\nend\n```\n\nHere `login` call inside before(:each) hook is needed just because cookies are cleared. But state is already shared using `before(:all)` so it's pretty pointless to clear cookies between examples of that context.\n\nTherefore I would like to write the following:\n\n``` ruby\nfeature 'some feature' do\n  include_context 'reset after'\n\n  before(:all) do\n    create_user\n    create_some_data_for_user\n  end\n\n  def before(:each) do\n    load_page_with_that_data\n  end\n\n  scenario '1' { do_action_1_with_that_data_without_changing_it }\n  scenario '2' { do_action_2_with_that_data_without_changing_it }\nend\n```\n\nBy including that context I would like to tell that cookies should be cleared only after the context, not after each example.\n\nBut I haven't found a way to check inside `config.after` hook whether a particular shared_context has been included into one of parent example groups. I think it could be done in RSpec e.g. by setting some flag (e.g. metadata) inside `find_and_eval_shared` method. User of RSpec would be able to use that flag inside `config.after { |example| ... }` to check if a context was included or not.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-29T17:57:36Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T17:57:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1762","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1762/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1762/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1762/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1762","id":47768578,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0Nzc2ODU3OA==","number":1762,"title":"Auto-included

when you define a shared example group with metadata, the implementation does this:\n\n``` ruby\nmod = Module.new\n(class << mod; self; end).__send__(:define_method, :included) do |host|\n  host.class_exec(&block)\nend\nRSpec.configuration.include mod, *metadata_args\n```\n\nIt delegates to `configuration.include` in order to make the shared group auto-included in example groups that have matching metadata.\n\nThere's a discrepancy with the scoping rules of shared example groups, though: if the shared group is defined within a nested group it is only available for manual inclusion (using `include_context` or similar) within that group or a nested group.  With the metadata auto-inclusion, the shared group would still be included in any matching example group, even if it's \"out of scope\" according to our manual inclusion scoping rules.\n\nWe should

got this brilliant error message today:\n\n```\n`method_missing': `whatever` is not available on an example group (e.g. a `describe` or `context` block). It is only available from within individual examples (e.g. `it` blocks) or from constructs that run in the scope of an example (e.g. `before`, `let`, etc). (RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup::WrongScopeError)\n```\n\nThen I began to wonder why there's no built in way to include support helpers easily. Here's a rough sketch of what I'm thinking would be incredibly useful:\n\n``` ruby\nRSpec.support(:controller_support, type: :controller) do\n  group_helpers do\n    def helper_for_a_describe_block\n    end\n  end\n  example_helpers do\n    def helper_for_a_let_block\n    end\n    def helper_for_an_it_block\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI was earlier repeating this pattern all over the place:\n\n``` ruby\nmodule ControllerSupport\n  # Methods to add to both example groups and examples\n  module Global\n  end\n\n  # Methods to add to example groups (i.e. `describe` or `context` blocks)\n  module GroupHelpers\n  end\n\n  # Add methods to add to examples (i.e. `it` blocks) or constructs that run in\n  # the scope of an example (e.g. `before`, `let`, etc)\n  module ExampleHelpers; end\nend\n\nRSpec.configure do |config|\n  config.extend ControllerSupport::Global, type: :controller\n  config.extend ControllerSupport::GroupHelpers, type: :controller\n  config.include ControllerSupport::Global, type: :controller\n  config.include ControllerSupport::ExampleHelpers, type: :controller\nend\n```\n\nRight now, I use this hackiness to do the dirty work, and it's been a pleasure so far:\n\n``` ruby\ndef RSpec.support(module_name, options = {})\n  RSpec.configure do |config|\n    if defined?(module_name::Global)\n      config.extend module_name::Global, options\n      config.include module_name::Global, options\n    end\n    if defined?(module_name::GroupHelpers)\n      config.extend module_name::GroupHelpers, options\n    end\n    if defined?(module_name::ExampleHelpers)\n      config.include module_name::ExampleHelpers, options\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Now I can do this!\nmodule ModelSupport; end\nRSpec.support(ModelSupport, type: :model)\n```\n\nI'd love to implement this myself with some guidance if you all are interested.\n\nCheers!

No need to specify `type` in `:controller` specs.\nshared_context :current_user, type: :feature do\n  let(:user) { create :user }\n\n  before do\n    login_as user, scope: :user\n  end\nend\n\nshared_context :current_user do\n  let(:user) { create :user }\n\n  before do\n    sign_in user\n  end\nend\n```\n\nAnd it works great, but know I'm getting this warning:\n\n```\nWARNING: Shared example group 'current_user' has been previously defined at:\n  ~/dev/ruby/apps/{...}/spec/support/shared_contexts/current_user.rb:4\n...and you are now defining it at:\n  ~/dev/ruby/apps/{...}/spec/support/shared_contexts/current_user.rb:12\nThe new definition will overwrite the original one.\n```\n\nThe thing is that the new definition **isn't overwriting the original one**. They behave as expected in the `:feature` and `:controller` specs correspondingly.\n\nApologies for my ignorance, I don't know if those attributes supported or how the `shared_context` method implemented, but those `context`s are definitely treated as different ones and the warning logic should probably be updated. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/160356963","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1790#issuecomment-160356963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1790","id":160356963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDM1Njk2Mw==","user":{"login":"xaviershay","id":1714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay","html_url":"https://github.com/xaviershay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-29T01:46:19Z","updated_at":"2015-11-29T01:46:19Z","body":"> One update to this idea: we could consider making config.include support shared group names in addition to module references, rather than introducing a new config.include_context API.\n\nThen it's switching behaviour based on type of the argument?
