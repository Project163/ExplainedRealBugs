TL;DR - Summary\n\nThe way ordering is configured and handled in RSpec is far from intuitive and the use cases aren't compelling or practical IMHO, even though they're potentially extremely useful if properly understood and conveniently implemented.\n## Goal\n\nIdeally, learning from experiences with existing/previous API and current potential use cases would help design a flexible, maintainable, clear, configurable, extensible and simple new API.\n\nSo first I'd like to just collect all the issues and useful use cases in one place, so that any new API proposal would have to take all or most into account.\n### Earlier discussions\n\nI started with a need to run specs in a different order than \"alphabetical\": \n\nThen I unintentionally started a long discussion in the wrong place (PR comments) here: https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/2248#discussion_r65132326\n### List of issues with current/past issues with ordering API\n#### 1. Invisible algorithms.\n\nIt's not clear to the user (no output, insufficient docs) how things are being ordered within RSpec and why. E.g. it's not clear files are sorted alphabetically for the sake of providing consistent input for seeding. There's no doc describing even how the ordering works, e.g. that:\n1. Files are always sorted alphabetically and duplicate entries are removed\n2. Groups (?) are sorted by given ordering algorithm (random by seed).\n3. Items within a group are somehow sorted by metadata (?)\n#### 2. Cmdline order of files not respected.\n\nThis is counter-intuitive, because it's alphabetical, even if the order mode is `:random`. Even if it \"makes sense\" to make randomized orders deterministic, that's already too much \"know how\".\n#### 3. Not out-of-the-box support for unit+acceptance testing\n\nNo useful, intuitive example for a folder named 'spec/acceptance` where the user expects tests there to be run last.\n#### 4. Actual options aren't intuitive in how they work.\n\nE.g. Random with same seed is not random. Files are sorted alphabetically (though this isn't mentioned anywher). `:global` order strategy probably does some magic, depending on whether individual examples have an `:order` tag or not. Strategy is reused for sorting both groups and their examples, except by default. (files are alphabetical, examples are randomized).\n#### 5. Bad practice supported by default.\n\nIt seems like the basic theme behind ordering is to avoid having order-dependent examples. This feels like more of a half-baked CI feature - as opposed to running each example in isolation. The drawback of fully isolated examples (e.g. one per RSpec process) is: they're extremely slow. But on a CI, a fast build time is less of a priority than avoiding bugs.\n\nThe only \"order related\" issues I've ever run into were with:\n1. Threads/objects leaking between specs.\n2. Forgetting a `require`.\n\nThe first needs threads to be joined/killed before the next tests runs, so ordering can't help here much, since it's not deterministic anyway. The second needs running each spec in isolation, for which random ordering also isn't a good replacement for.\n\nI personally think the idea of randomizing tests if overemphasized so much, it's been only detrimental with little pay-off. Rerunning tests simply in normal and then reverse order would likely catch even more issues than a \"random\" set. \n\nSo I'd argue that \"reverse\" would actually be more useful in practice than \"random\".\n#### 6. Ordering gets in the way of workflows.\n\nThis is my biggest issue. A \"workflow\" can mean e.g. \"running files in the order I want\". E.g. I want to run just the unit test, then the functional test, then the acceptance test for one given feature/bug. I don't have the confidence I can achieve this quickly and without making mistakes. It's actually easier to just run 3 separate RSpec processes in sequence, which pretty much means ordering is useless. (Because there's no \"ordering\" if you have only one object).\n\nAlso, with randomizing, fail-fast will return a different result every time. Too many times I thought I fixed something, only to realize it's still buggy a few rspec runs later (once I've forgotten the context already). The \"workaround\" is to set a fixed seed in `.rspec-local`, but if you forget to remove it afterwards, it renders the order randomizing feature useless.\n\nIt's like the only convenient \"choice\" I have is: \"specific random order\" and \"random random order\". Not very good for any intelligent/useful workflow.\n#### 7. Ordering strategy doesn't protect from removing/duplicating entries.\n\nThe idea of passing a list to a sorting strategy (and expecting a sorted list to be returned) seems flawed. It's should be sufficient to have a `compare` method that takes either two groups or two examples and returns the result of comparing, much like `<=>`. Kind of like Ruby's `sort` works.\n\nThis would make configuration simpler, because reverse alphabetical sorting of groups can be done by just switching arguments, e.g. when using `sort`:\n\n``` ruby\n%w( x z y ).sort { |a,b| b <=> a } # reverse alphabetical order\n```\n\nAnd the resulting array is guaranteed to have the same count of items as the input array. Meanwhile, accidentally modifying the given list can have all sorts of hard-to-debug side effects.\n\nIt's also much easier to reason about whether one example should come before another - than to work with partitions or use sort a whole list anyway with a custom compare method (lots more code in configuration).\n\nAnd there's a lot less testing too (as opposed to having lists to work with).\n\nAdditionally, if examples define a custom order themselves, then the `compare` would be skipped for those, so custom `:order` metadata would always work, regardless of the sorting strategy. (So the strategy wouldn't need to take those into account at all and tests would be safe from breakage).\n#### 8. Reusing the same strategy for sorting examples vs groups.\n\nPreviously, these were separate and ordering become example-specific. This doesn't make sense semantically, because examples and groups are different types and potentially need different sorting strategies.\n\nSo with a custom strategy, it's easy to mess up one set (e.g. examples) while tweaking the sorting of another (e.g. groups). It heavily blurs the distinction between files, example groups and examples.\n\nE.g. I'm less likely to have \"acceptance examples\" within a group. I'm more likely to have \"acceptance test\" defined on groups.\n#### 9. I understand SQL, but I don't understand RSpec.\n\nIt should be easier to relate one to the other. I mentioned in another post that RSpec is much like a database client app, because you can expect needs like those that can be expressed in pseudo-SQL, e.g:\n\n``` sql\nselect * from examples \njoin groups on example.group_id = group.id\nwhere example.slow == true and group.type != 'acceptance' # filtering\norder by example.order asc, example.line_number desc # ordering\n```\n\nThere's no reason why selecting and filtering in RSpec shouldn't be as understandable, simple and flexible with the right API. A simple custom `compare` method (or block) with 2 arguments would handle ordering, and a simple `match?` method with 1 argument would handle filtering.\n\nThere's also no reason why filtering couldn't be as generic as well. More filtering options could be handled with just one command-line option, e.g.:\n\n```\nrspec -include 'example.tag==slow && example.filename.matches(unit/**/*_spec.rb) && example.name.includes('foo') && example.failed_previously`\n```\n\nOf course the goal isn't to implement SQL or Arel in RSpec, but just to allow an internal API where this can be implemented reliably and usefully if needed - with minimal trade-offs.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
