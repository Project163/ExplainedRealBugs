When an example group runs, it first [runs its examples](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/v3.1.7/lib/rspec/core/example_group.rb#L453), then [recursively delegates to each of its child example groups](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/v3.1.7/lib/rspec/core/example_group.rb#L454).  This means that the examples of a group will always run before its nested example groups, even if some nested group were defined first.\n> \n> However, with `--order defined`, the items within each category will be run in defined order.\n> \n> This is a subtlety that we didn't bear in mind when writing the docs (or even when naming the `--order defined` option).\n> \n> As for what we should do about it...I'm going to put some thoughts about that on [the issue you opened](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1756).\n\nWe have two routes we can go here:\n- We can update the documentation to clarify that examples are always run before nested groups.\n- We can change the way that it works so that examples and nested groups can be interleaved and will be run in their defined order.\n\nIf we wanted to do the latter, we'd need to come up with a common \"runnable\" interface that examples and example groups both share, and then have each group keep track of a single list of `runnables` as examples and example groups are defined.\n\nThis has a downside, though.  It would complicate the [custom ordering API](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration#register_ordering-instance_method).  Currently the block is given a homogenous list of either examples or example groups; if we allowed them to be interleaved it would create heterogenous lists, which could complicate the logic in the block.  It could potentially break some users (particularly if they have a `register_ordering` block that checks the type of the first item in the list and then assumes all items in the list are of that type).\n\nI think that I favor changing the docs to clarify how it works.

Stating that it is \"_not recommended_\" is not something I would feel comfortable standing behind.\n\n@kevinrutherford From your description of the problem you faced, I would say the way you are utilizing RSpec is not a suggested path to follow. In general, our recommendation is that specs should be able to run in isolation (i.e. I can run a single spec by itself) and thus specs should not rely on other specs being run before them.\n\nIn the few instances where I do want this, they are generally integration specs. I write these as single example \"flows\" which have multiple expectations per example.

just updated my gems and the order is no longer working the way I expected. It feels sort of broken. I like to write my tests before the code. The first test should be the first to fail. I write the code to make that work, it passes, the next test fails, and so on. You know the drill.\n\nUnless you write your spec with a really restrictive and flat notion of contexts, the first to fail could be any test in the spec file. I'm using capybara, so I'll use `features` and `scenarios` in this example:\n\n```\nfeature 'Comments' do\n  background do\n    # create something to put comments on\n  end\n\n  feature 'can be created' do\n    scenario 'by the original author' do\n      ...\n    end\n\n    scenario 'by moderators' do\n      ...\n    end\n\n    scenario 'by other users' do\n      ...\n    end\n  end\n\n  scenario 'can be viewed' do\n    ...\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis might not be the best example, but it does clearly shows how rspec present the developer with a chicken-and-egg problem: it jumps to the `viewing` scenario before any of the `create` scenarios. I think technically, this is correctly written spec but it can't be used for TDD. From a rubist's perspective evaluating specs top-down and then recursively when a nested context is encountered is clearly most expected. It doesn't appear that's possible currently.\n\nI totally accept that I might be missing some key

Your feedback is useful as another datapoint that an RSpec user is disliking how the ordering works.  We may address this in a future release if there is more widespread community

appreciate you looking into that... Browsing the old specs in the history I can see they are a lot more simple. The projects I've been working on have become more complicated and the tests more sophisticated so I'm exercising _all_ my tools more. The project I'm on now is probably my largest in a few years and missed this issue by happenstance until today (which coincided with a gem update, so there was some synchronicity involved here). I have to wonder how many other people are sidestepping it \"just because\".\n\nAll else being equal, I'm really glad to have rspec in my toolkit. It's saved me untold hours and is generally a pleasure to work with.
