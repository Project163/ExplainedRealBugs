In many (maybe most?) of the cases, the value is `true`:\n\n<pre>\ndescribe \"something\", :slow => true, :focus => true, :issue => '79' do\n...\nend\n</pre>\n\n\nIt would be nice to be able to write this:\n\n<pre>\ndescribe \"something\", :slow, :focus, :issue => '79' do\n...\nend\n</pre>\n\n\nEssentially, you can still use a hash if you want, but any symbols given as arguments would become hash keys with the value of `true`.  This should allow you to differentiate between additional describe text and metadata keys:\n\n<pre>\ndescribe Array, \"with 3 items\", :slow, :focus do\n...\nend\n</pre>\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
