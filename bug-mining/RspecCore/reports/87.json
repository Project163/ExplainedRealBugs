In 2.x it seems to be only possible to use 1 if not doing it code-wise.\n\nIt would be great to have also native support for multiple since i'm usually using documentation formatter and html formatter together. This makes sense if test-run is longer so i can see quicker feedback on the console window and more details in html report by using some custom formatter.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
