In cases where you have nested shared example groups, it'd be nice if the whole \"shared example call stack\" was displayed.\n- Once we get that call stack in place exposed from the metadata, this becomes far easier--you can just walk up that call stack to the original entry point to shared examples (e.g. the top-level `it_behaves_like` in a spec file).\n- That said, bear in mind that if you re-run the specs passing that line number, it'll run all of the shared examples, and not just the failing one. \n\n> Is there a chance that something like this will find its way into the RSpec core? So all formatters would print the xxx_spec.rb line even for shared examples?\n\nYep, I'd like to fix things so that any formatters which use `dump_commands_to_rerun_failed_examples` include the originating line for the use of the shared example group.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/13611551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/13611767","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/793#issuecomment-13611767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/793","id":13611767,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjExNzY3","user":{"login":"jmuheim","id":1814983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTQ5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1814983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim","html_url":"https://github.com/jmuheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmuheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-15T15:33:07Z","updated_at":"2013-02-15T15:33:07Z","body":"I'm happy to see that I could start a serious discussion about this.

https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/793\n\nmodule Guard\n  class RSpec\n    class Formatter\n      def self.extract_spec_location(metadata)\n\n        while !(metadata[:location] =~ /_spec.rb:\\d+$/) do\n\n          metadata = metadata[:example_group]\n          raise 'No spec file could be found in meta data!' unless metadata\n\n        end\n\n        metadata[:location]\n      end\n\n      def _failed_paths\n        failed = examples.select { |e| e.execution_result[:status] == 'failed' }\n        failed.map { |e| extract_spec_location(e.metadata[:location]) }\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIs there a better way to fix this issue?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/guard/guard-rspec/issues/243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":104660686,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEwNDY2MDY4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/104660686","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-03-24T04:06:21Z","milestone":{"title":"Post

[minitest-bisect](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest-bisect) project looks really useful for use on minitest-based projects.  I'd like to see something similar in RSpec.  It could be a separate gem (as it is for minitest) but I think it would fit well in rspec-core.  Bisect isn't a feature you normally need or use on an ongoing basis -- it's just when you suddenly hit an order dependency you didn't know you had that RSpec's random ordering has surfaced.  In such a situation, it's sub-optimal to have to install another gem, and you may not even be able to (such as if you run into this situation when you are offline).  Having it built in to rspec-core will keep it available when you need it without you having to plan ahead to have the gem available.\n\nIdeally, the output of the `--bisect` flag would provide you with a command you can run to reproduce the failure with the smallest number of examples that triggers the error.  One thing that would help is a way to select specific examples from the command line.  We have the `-e` flag now that selects examples with matching doc strings, and we have the `file:line_number` syntax, but those are not workable solutions to selecting a specific examples in some situations. Consider that we allow multiple examples to be defined with the same doc string (ruling out `-e`) and the same line can define multiple examples, if you use a loop, ruling out `file:line_number`.  Instead, I was thinking we could introduce a new `--ids` option, which would take a form like:\n\n``` ruby\nrspec --ids 2:14,3:1:20,4:2:1:5\n```\n\n...which would run the 14th example defined in the 2nd example group, the 20th example from the first example group nested within the 3rd global example group, and the 5th example from the 1st group within the 2nd group within the 4th global example group.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1767/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":213709835,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIxMzcwOTgzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/213709835","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cc865dc3ed52fc80d12a8b86869fcd53cc47991c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/commits/cc865dc3ed52fc80d12a8b86869fcd53cc47991c","created_at":"2015-01-03T21:44:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
