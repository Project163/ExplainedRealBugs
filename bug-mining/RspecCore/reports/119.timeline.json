the RakeTask definition.\n\n``` ruby\nnamespace :spec do\n  desc \"Run all specs with rcov in spec directory (excluding plugin specs)\"\n  RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:rcov => 'db:test:prepare') do |t|\n    t.rspec_opts = [\"--profile\", \"--format progress\"]\n    t.rcov       = true\n    t.rcov_opts  = \"--failure-threshold --rails --exclude test/*,spec/*,features/*,factories/*,gems/*\"\n    t.verbose    = false\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI think I figured out the issue. Since rspec-core now requires you to require `rspec/autorun` if not using the `rspec` command, and since this is using the `rcov` command, and since it's a Rails app using rspec-rails which the generated `spec_helper.rb` file requires `rspec/rails` which requires `rspec/core` and never requires `rspec/autorun`, RSpec's autorun never kicks in and then RCov tried to run Test::Unit instead. Adding `require 'rspec/autorun'` inside my `spec_helper.rb` file has allowed me to workaround the issue. Not sure what a good long-term solution would be for the project.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/1150706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cgriego","id":4805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego","html_url":"https://github.com/cgriego","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgriego/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/1150711","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/370#issuecomment-1150711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/370","id":1150711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNTA3MTE=","user":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-05-13T03:23:16Z","updated_at":"2011-05-13T03:23:16Z","body":"What
