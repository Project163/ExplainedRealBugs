remembered one other reason I tend to prefer `inject`...\n\nFor a long time, I would forget the ordering of the yielded arguments, especially given that the ordering of the yielded arguments of `each_with_object` (which is quite similar) is the reverse.  Then I realized that the names of the two methods reveal the ordering of the arguments:\n- `array.each_with_object({}) { |element, hash| }`: Like `each_with_index`, this adds an additional yielded argument _after_ the individual yielded element.  It would be odd for the accumulator object to come first.\n- `array.inject({}) { |hash, element| }`: I read this as \"inject this hash into this array\".  The accumulator comes first because the method name is phrased to focus on what's being injected.\n\nSince thinking that through, I've never again had a problem with the block arg ordering of these two.  I don't think `reduce` suggests the argument ordering in the same way.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/26234881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/26235300","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1110#issuecomment-26235300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1110","id":26235300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjM1MzAw","user":{"login":"xaviershay","id":1714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay","html_url":"https://github.com/xaviershay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-14T04:38:42Z","updated_at":"2013-10-14T04:38:42Z","body":"We
