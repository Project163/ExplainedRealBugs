This is the behaviour expected in `2.14`, but we are thinking about changing it.

So it is more or less a duplicate of #952. \n\n `rspec spec_filename:line_number` is not a specific location for me. It is only a specific location when it directly refers to a simple spec.

In my point of view a specific location would be like `rspec spec_filename:line_number::included_file:line_number::included_file:line_number`.\n\nBut I think my shared example is a realy special
