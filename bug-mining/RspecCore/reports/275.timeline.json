For your case you are using `it_behaves_like` which creates a nested group, and there's a much stronger argument to be made that since it creates a nested group, and nested group metadata takes precedence over metadata inherited from an outer group, the shared metadata should take metadata for that case.\n\nI'll see if it's feasible to implement

when applying shared group metadata to a host, if there were\nany conflicts, the host group metadata would take precedence, but this\ncreated some counterintuitive behavior.  For example, in a case like\nthis:\n\n``` ruby\nRSpec.shared_examples_for \"model stuff\", db: true do\n  it \"does something using the DB\" do\n    # ...\n  end\nend\n\nRSpec.describe \"Some cross cutting concern\", db: false do\n  it_behaves_like \"model stuff\"\nend\n```\n\n...the example from the shared group would NOT have `db: true` metadata\nin spite of the fact that `it_behaves_like` creates a nested group and\nif you manually created a nested group at that spot with `:db`, it would\ntake precedence over the outer `db: false` metadata.\n\nWith this change, metadata applied from a shared group takes precedence\nover host group metadata if the conflicted value was inherited from a\nparent group. If the conflicted value was set directly on the host\ngroup, it still takes precedence.\n\nFixes #2306.\n\n@rspec/rspec: there's definitely room for interpretation in how this should work and I'm not 100% sure this is the behavior we want but I think it's the most reasonable and the most consistent with our metadata inheritance usually works.
