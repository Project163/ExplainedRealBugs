When you run `ruby test.rb`, the backtrace line has `test.rb` (without the full, absolute path).  Our [current logic](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/v3.1.7/lib/rspec/core/notifications.rb#L279-L284) looks for the full, absolute path of the example location, so it fails when you run `ruby test.rb`.  However, if you run `ruby /full/path/to/test.rb`, it'll work.  We might be able to improve our logic so that it works for your case without forcing you to pass the absolute file name but I haven't thought that through far enough to figure out how we'd do
