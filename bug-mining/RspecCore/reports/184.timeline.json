Backtrace filtering is certainly working for me, and I haven't heard of problems from any other users (if it was a widespread problem I'm sure we would get many reports).  Someone will have to troubleshoot the code in rspec-core (running in the context of your spec suite) that should be filtering the backtraces and figure out why it's not.  If you can come up with something I can clone and run to demo the problem (such as a gist), I'll be happy to take a look; if not, you'll have to do that yourself.  If you decide to troubleshoot this, I recommend putting a breakpoint and/or some logging in [this method](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/lib/rspec/core/formatters/helpers.rb#L6-L16)--that's where the backtrace should be filtered.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/11618222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/11621006","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/754#issuecomment-11621006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/754","id":11621006,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjIxMDA2","user":{"login":"jackfranklin","id":193238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/193238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin","html_url":"https://github.com/jackfranklin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-21T17:38:56Z","updated_at":"2012-12-21T17:39:03Z","body":"@myronmarston thanks for your help.
