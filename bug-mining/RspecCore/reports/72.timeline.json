The only reason they use that in cucumber, is 'coz they have text files where they have to make the tags distinctive and stand out in pure text.\n\nI have been looking at Cucumber FM (feature manager) which uses tags extensively but is limited to the current \"symbols only\" approach in cucumber. I proceeded to add hash tags to my own forks of _cucumber_ and _gherkin_, but couldn't figure out where gherkin parses the tags, so they are currently limited to the following format:\n\n@authors:bria_m;sally_k @estimate:3 @wip\n\nwhich would internally translate to a tags hash like this:\n\n{:authors => ['brian_m', 'sally_k'],  :estimate => 3, :wip => true}\n\nMore info here:\nhttp://github.com/kristianmandrup/cucumber\nhttp://github.com/kristianmandrup/gherkin\n\nThis lets you filter scenarios and features that match given criteria, fx all written by a given author with an estimate > 2.\n\ncucumber --tags @authors=brian_m @estimate>2 ~@wip\n\nWould love to see this in effect and usable from command line in rspec 2 :)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/355741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kristianmandrup","id":125005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup","html_url":"https://github.com/kristianmandrup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/355743","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/37#issuecomment-355743","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/37","id":355743,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTc0Mw==","user":{"login":"kristianmandrup","id":125005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup","html_url":"https://github.com/kristianmandrup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristianmandrup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-08-15T15:26:25Z","updated_at":"2010-08-15T15:29:52Z","body":"Example:\n\n$ rspec spec --tags authors:in[brian_m;
