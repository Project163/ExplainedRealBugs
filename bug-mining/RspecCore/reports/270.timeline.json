is more complex than I first realized and not limited to mixing ids and files -- it also applies to mixing locations (e.g. `file_name:line_num`) and files, and as such, is not a new issue.  So I don't consider it a release blocker anymore but would still like to get it addressed in the near term.\n\nTo describe the problem in more detail:\n- We treat location and id filters as being scoped to a given file, and as such they don't apply to other files.  Thus, when you run `rspec path/to/spec_1.rb[1:1] path/to/spec_2.rb` it should run the first example from the first group in `spec_1.rb` and all the specs in `spec_2.rb`.\n- This works under the default RSpec configuration (which is why our existing specs didn't catch it).\n- It does _not_ work when you've configured `filter_run :focus` and `run_all_when_everything_filtered` (which is very common, given that it's in the generated `spec_helper.rb`.\n- The reason it doesn't work is because `run_all_when_everything_filtered`  doesn't do anything in this case.  Examples from `spec_1.rb` are filtered (i.e. all examples but the 1st one in the 1st group), and thus the `:focus` filter is left in effect and it applies to the specs in `spec_2.rb`, and since none of them are filtered, none of them run.\n- The `:focus` filtering does _not_ apply to the spec that is selected from `spec_1.rb` via the ID from the command line.  We decided that when you explicitly select an example from the command line that should take precedence and the example should run.\n- I think the fix will be to move away from `run_all_when_everything_filtered` to a new config option with an improved semantic -- something like `ignore_unmatched_filters`.  The idea of this new config option is that when set, configured filters would only be in effect if they apply to at least one example or group.  So the `:focus` filtering would only apply if something is tagged with `:focus`.  Unlike `run_all_when_everything_filtered`, when `ignore_unmatched_filters` kicks in, it would only ignore the specific filters that are unmatched; other matched filters would be left alone and in effect.\n- I've thought a bit about whether or not `run_all_when_everything_filtered` should simply be changed to do what I've describe above for `ignore_unmatched_filters`.  However, if we make that change, then I don't think that it's behavior aligns with its name at all, and as such it would be confusing.  So I'm thinking that we should instead do the following:\n  - Introduce the new `ignore_unmatched_filters` option\n  - Update the generated `spec_helper.rb` to set `ignore_unmatched_filters` rather than `run_all_when_everything_filtered`\n  - Consider `run_all_when_everything_filtered` deprecated (but not necessarily emit a deprecation warning yet -- that can probably wait until 3.99)\n  - Remove `run_all_when_everything_filtered` in 4.0\n- Alternately, we could keep `run_all_when_everything_filtered` around and not consider it depecated.  However, I can't think of a situation where a user would rather have it than `ignore_unmatched_filters`.\n\nThoughts from @rspec/rspec

number and id filters are considered to be \"scoped\" filters in that they are attached to a specific file and don't apply to examples in other files.  Thus, w/o any other filters in affect:\n- `rspec spec1.rb[1:1] spec2.rb` runs the specified example from spec1.rb and all examples from spec2.rb.\n- `rspec spec1.rb:13 spec2.rb` is similar: runs the specified example (via line number instead of id) from spec1.rb and all examples from spec2.rb.\n\nWhen you throw focus filtering into the mix (e.g. under the [typical configuration](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/2a07aa92560cf6d4ae73ab04ff3b9b565451e83f/lib/rspec/core/project_initializer/spec/spec_helper.rb#L50-L51)):\n- `rspec spec1.rb[1:1] spec2.rb` and `rspec spec1.rb:13 spec2.rb`, when no examples are tagged with `:focus`, runs just the specified example from spec1.rb and nothing from spec2.rb.  (This is the bug that this issue is about).\n- `rspec spec1.rb[1:1] spec2.rb` and `rspec spec1.rb:13 spec2.rb`, when some examples are tagged with `:focus` in spec2.rb, runs the specified example from spec1.rb and the focused examples from spec2.rb. (This is correct, desired behavior).\n- `rspec spec1.rb[1:1] spec2.rb` and `rspec spec1.rb:13 spec2.rb`, when some examples are tagged with `:focus` in spec1.rb, ignores the focused examples since the user has selected a specific example from spec1.rb and CLI-specified examples take precedence.  Again, this is correct, desired behavior.\n\nDoes that help,

So I don't consider it a release blocker anymore but would still like to get it addressed in the near term.\n> \n> To describe the problem in more detail:\n> - We treat location and id filters as being scoped to a given file, and as such they don't apply to other files.  Thus, when you run `rspec path/to/spec_1.rb[1:1] path/to/spec_2.rb` it should run the first example from the first group in `spec_1.rb` and all the specs in `spec_2.rb`.\n> - This works under the default RSpec configuration (which is why our existing specs didn't catch it).\n> - It does _not_ work when you've configured `filter_run :focus` and `run_all_when_everything_filtered` (which is very common, given that it's in the generated `spec_helper.rb`.\n\nSo I think we should fix this, line numbers / ids etc aren't meant to have the same semantics as metadata filtering so the behaviour is incorrect in my opinion\n\n> - I think the fix will be to move away from `run_all_when_everything_filtered` to a new config option with an improved semantic -- something like `ignore_unmatched_filters`.  The idea of this new config option is that when set, configured filters would only be in effect if they apply to at least one example or group.  So the `:focus` filtering would only apply if something is tagged with `:focus`.  Unlike `run_all_when_everything_filtered`, when `ignore_unmatched_filters` kicks in, it would only ignore the specific filters that are unmatched; other matched filters would be left alone and in effect.\n> - I've thought a bit about whether or not `run_all_when_everything_filtered` should simply be changed to do what I've describe above for `ignore_unmatched_filters`.  However, if we make that change, then I don't think that it's behavior aligns with its name at all, and as such it would be confusing.  So I'm thinking that we should instead do the following:\n>   - Introduce the new `ignore_unmatched_filters` option\n>   - Update the generated `spec_helper.rb` to set `ignore_unmatched_filters` rather than `run_all_when_everything_filtered`\n>   - Consider `run_all_when_everything_filtered` deprecated (but not necessarily emit a deprecation warning yet -- that can probably wait until 3.99)\n>   - Remove `run_all_when_everything_filtered` in 4.0\n\nI guess this is semantically the same concept, I'm on board as long as we make it clear why we're ignoring the filter.\n\n> - Alternately, we could keep `run_all_when_everything_filtered` around and not consider it depecated.  However, I can't think of a situation where a user would rather have it than `ignore_unmatched_filters`.\n\nI think we should only have one way of doing things, so I think we should deprecate `run_all_when_everything_filtered` if we opt for `ignore_unmatched_filters`\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/91083318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JonRowe","id":162976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JonRowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/91129712","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1920#issuecomment-91129712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1920","id":91129712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxMTI5NzEy","user":{"login":"xaviershay","id":1714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay","html_url":"https://github.com/xaviershay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xaviershay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-09T06:49:23Z","updated_at":"2015-04-09T06:49:23Z","body":"Reading

you have `config.run_all_when_everything_filtered = true` set and you use `--only-failures` or `--next-failure` and there are no failures in the persistence file, the current behavior is to run _all_

This is counterintuitive because you've told RSpec to run only failures but instead it runs only successes (which happens to be all examples).  This is a consequence of the fact that failure filtering is implemented using the general filtering mechanism, and `run_all_when_everything_filtered` kicks in in this case.\n\nIdeally, if you used `--only-failures` or `--next-failure` and there were none, RSpec would abort quickly with a message stating there are no failures.  If we do that, one open question is what status code to use: on the one hand, the command kinda failed (it failed to find any failures to run) so maybe it should be non-zero.  Also, exiting with a zero status code when no examples were even run seems potentially problematic.  OTOH, I could see someone repeatedly running `rspec --next-failure && say \"done\"` (or similar -- idea inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/pragdave/status/570774584695218176)), and for this use case it would be important for RSpec to exit with a 0 status when it hits a point where there are no more failures to run.\n\nThoughts on what status code should be used for this?\n\nWe're also discussing phasing out `run_all_when_everything_filtered` in #1920 in favor of a new `ignore_unmatched_filters` option, so that should be taken into account for whatever solution we decide upon.\n\n/cc @rspec/rspec

been thinking about this some more, and I've realized that while the solution I proposed above -- `ignore_unmatched_filters` -- solves this issue, it creates other issues.  `rspec --only-failures` currently runs nothing if there are no failures to run.  A new `ignore_unmatched_filters` option would presumably ignore the filter created by `--only-failures` and run all examples instead.  Similarly, if someone runs `rspec --tag my_tag_mispelled` do they really want it to be ignored?  I doubt it.\n\nWhat I've realized is that a global option to ignore is generally problematic.  IIRC, `run_all_when_everything_filtered` was first introduced as a way to leave focus filtering in place and that's really the only use case I see for it.  I think that means that we really want a way to configure just the `:focus` filtering to be ignored if there are no matching examples, instead of configuring _all_ filters to be ignored.\n\nSo now I'm thinking we should introduce a new config option that is a sibling of `filter_run`.  Something like `conditonally_filter_run` or `filter_run_if_any_match` or similar.  Whereas `filter_run` would always apply (assuming `run_all_when_everything_filtered` is not set), this new config option would define a filter that would only apply if any examples match the metadata.\n\nBesides fixing this issue and avoiding an option that globally changes how filters work in undesirable ways, it also reduces the number of lines of config needed to get focus filtering to just one.\n\nThoughts?  And if we go this direction, what should we call the new config option?  \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/181976991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/182742931","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1920#issuecomment-182742931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1920","id":182742931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mjc0MjkzMQ==","user":{"login":"JonRowe","id":162976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JonRowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-11T07:14:07Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T07:14:07Z","body":"I like this, and we could then deprecate `run_all_when_everything_filtered` before RSpec 4?
