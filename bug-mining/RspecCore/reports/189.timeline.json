Now that the subject defines first and the let is handled as an alias to subject, as you go deeper, the target of the name changes each time a new subject is defined.\n\nPrior to this version:\n\n``` ruby\nsubject(:thingy) { 'a thingamabob' }\n```\n\nequated to:\n\n``` ruby\nlet(:thingy) { 'a thingamabob' }\nsubject { thingy }\n```\n\nNow:\n\n``` ruby\nsubject(:thingy) { 'another metasyntactic variable' }\n```\n\nroughly equates to (if subject is available in a let):\n\n``` ruby\nsubject { 'another metasyntactic variable' }\nlet(:thingy) { subject }\n```\n\nI guess it comes down to whether you see a named subject as an alias for \"subject\" or as a name for that specific defined subject value regardless of where you are...\n\nWith this change, many people will have to return to the older syntax of defined let, then subject that points to the let to avoid the value of a named subject changing as they nest subjects.\n\nFor now, that's the fix for my broken tests. I look forward to seeing how this works out.

inner/outer subject confusion when using a named subject.\n\nThis fixes #800 while preserving the behavior we settled on in #757.  However, the complexity of supporting `super` in a named subject (look at that crazy metaprogramming I had to do!) makes me think that we should disable `super` in named subjects altogether instead.  @alindeman and I [discussed this previously](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/757#issuecomment-11770186) and decided that `super` in a named subject should super to the outer subject, not an outer `let` declaration; however, to prevent the bug reported in #800, we have to make the `let` declaration primary with the subject simply an alias to the `let`...which causes `super` to call the parent `let` method, not the parent subject.\n\nSo...I'm thinking of changing this so that it raises a `super() can't be used in a named subject` error instead.  Really, I don't think there's a good use case for supporting it.  It is a bit of a breaking change (since 2.13.0 is out with `super` calling the parent subject), and we need to get a patch release out to fix #800, so that's a bit of a problem, but I'm not sure what to do about it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/14154623","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/800#issuecomment-14154623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/800","id":14154623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTU0NjIz","user":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-27T03:30:14Z","updated_at":"2013-02-27T03:30:14Z","body":"@nbfritz -- thanks for your comments, it helped me track down this bug.
