just pushed a fix to rspec-mocks (rspec/rspec-mocks@39acf194e504346083dcfeee81c6eb30a267e294) to use `skip` instead of `pending` due to the recent changes but I noticed the `skip` arg is not being used as the reason in the output:\n\n```\n  #any_instance when used in conjunction with a `dup` doesn't cause an infinite loop\n    # No reason given\n    # ./spec/rspec/mocks/any_instance_spec.rb:970\n```\n\nNot a merge blocker for beta2.\n\n/cc @xaviershay
