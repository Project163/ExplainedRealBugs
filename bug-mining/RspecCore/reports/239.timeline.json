issue is actually caused by the linked rspec-rails issue (not fixed by :grimacing:). The root of the issue is in rspec-core in how it manages multiple aliases with the same name.\n\nThe default setup does not cause the issue b/c the `spec/rails_helper.rb` loads `spec/spec_helper.rb` first. Since you were testing with `config.expose_dsl_globally = false` set in `spec/spec_helper.rb` it's turned off before either the capybara or rspec-rails aliases are registered. To the `undef_method` call is never made with `feature`.\n\nIn your sample app, you load both the Rails environment (which loads capybara) and rspec-rails while the DSL is still globally exposed; RSpec 3 still defaults to it exposed. This registers the `:feature` alias twice. When you then turn off the global DSL we attempt to undefine `:feature` twice causing the issue.\n\nI have a fix ready to push up once I wrap up a spec for it.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/68386668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cupakromer","id":1524496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer","html_url":"https://github.com/cupakromer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cupakromer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/68387873","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1824#issuecomment-68387873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1824","id":68387873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Mzg3ODcz","user":{"login":"nathany","id":4566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany","html_url":"https://github.com/nathany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-30T19:22:03Z","updated_at":"2014-12-30T19:22:03Z","body":"Thanks for the explanation.
