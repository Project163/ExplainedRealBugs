The weird thing is that <tt>rspec spec/</tt> still has color even when the Spork server is running, and Autotest has color when the Spork server _isn't_ running, so it appears to be an interaction between the three parts (RSpec, Autotest, and Spork). But the only thing that has changed is RSpec 2.0.0.rc to 2.0.0, so the issue ultimately must be with the <tt>rspec</tt> (or <tt>rspec-rails</tt>) gem.\n\nI'd appreciate any suggestions about how to fix this. My guess is that it is related to commit e68923d37af44a46f933f7a5d05fa728ed38552a, but I'm not sure; please let me know if you need any further information to help diagnose the problem. My setup is described in [Chapter 3 of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/chapters/static-pages#top), and this is the only thing keeping me from including RSpec 2.0.0 final in the print edition of the book.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
