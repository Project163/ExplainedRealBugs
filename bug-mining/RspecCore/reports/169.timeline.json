Here are the steps that RSpec takes:\n\n1.) Eval the `before(:all)` block.\n2.) \"store\" the ivars produced from the block.\n\nStep 2 is never called because of the exception in step 1. I started working on a fix for this, but then I started thinking \"what benefit would this provide?\". We shouldn't need to keep access to ivars if an exception happens in a `before` hook -- it is against the normal flow of how RSpec works. The ivars are available in the `after` hooks _if_ the \"flow\" happens correctly (no exceptions were raised).\n\nI understand the pain in your situation; you probably have to manually kill the selenium instance. Whatever you're holding in that ivar in the `before(:all)`, you could probably hold it in a global variable and still have access to it in the `after(:all)` (even with an exception being raised).\n\n@dchelimsky @myronmarston - do you guys think we should retain access to ivars in `after(:all)`'s even if an exception is raised in the `before(:all)`?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/3600916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"justinko","id":14007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko","html_url":"https://github.com/justinko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8268661,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODI2ODY2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/8268661","actor":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-01-22T03:25:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8268662,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgyNjg2NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/8268662","actor":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-01-22T03:25:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8268663,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODI2ODY2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/8268663","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-01-22T03:25:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8268664,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgyNjg2NjQ=","url":"https://api.githu
