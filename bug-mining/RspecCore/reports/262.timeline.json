While we don’t generally want to show lines\n  from gems, it’s better than showing no line at all.\n\nFixes #1991.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":434860392,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzNDg2MDM5Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/434860392","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aadd339c9ebdbffcfad52b0a94c435b787ffdd66","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/commits/aadd339c9ebdbffcfad52b0a94c435b787ffdd66","created_at":"2015-10-14T06:31:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":435359382,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDM1MzU5Mzgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/435359382","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-14T15:44:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3941611878,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5NDE2MTE4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/3941611878","actor":{"login":"MatheusRich","id":20938712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTM4NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20938712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich","html_url":"https://github.com/MatheusRich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"deadd13c8f3df26a7dcea1f0a74f1a051b3a3134","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MatheusRich/rspec-core/commits/deadd13c8f3df26a7dcea1f0a74f1a051b3a3134","created_at":"2020-10-30T14:51:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
