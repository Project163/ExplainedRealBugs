is definitely a regression.  Thanks for putting together the reproduction!\n\nThe regression is caused by 0a4937b8e7986f6702d0750dcc2621284b2a687d / 8772cf56683e7e9b647e46734b02534f526bfd30 (the first commit caused the regression in master (3.3.0.pre) whereas the latter caused it in 3.2.2).  When you run a command line `rspec --tag foo 1_spec.rb:10 2_spec.rb 3_spec.rb`, the line number filter (10) should only apply to `1_spec.rb` where as the tag filter should only apply to `2_spec.rb` and `3_spec.rb`.  So line number filters are treated as being _scoped_ to the specific file they are attached to and should not apply to other spec files.\n\nIn your case, you've got specs defined in a shared example group file, and so the line number filtering isn't applying and they are running in spite of the fact they shouldn't.  I'm not sure what the solution should be but here are a few thoughts:\n- We can differentiate between spec files and non-spec files that define examples via `RSpec.configuration.loaded_spec_files`.  \n- In master, there's a new metadata entry for every example and group that may be helpful here: `:rerun_file_path`.  Whereas `:file_path` is the location on disk where the example is defined, `:rerun_file_path` is the file that needs to be passed as an argument to `rspec` in order to run or rerun a particular example.  For the shared example in your spec, the `:file_path` would be `spec/a_test_that_always_runs_external_examples.rb` where as `:rerun_file_path` would be `spec/minimal_spec.rb`.\n- For line number filtering, it can only apply to examples defined in the specified file (obviously) but examples in other files that have the specified file as the `:rerun_file_path` should not run or be available to filter by a tag or some other mechanism.\n\nDoes that help point you in a direction for trying to work up a PR?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/100938397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/100938699","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1961#issuecomment-100938699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1961","id":100938699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDkzODY5OQ==","user":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-11T15:09:11Z","updated_at":"2015-05-11T15:09:11Z","body":"One other thing...if you use `:rerun_file_path`, that's available in `master` but not in 3-2-maintenance, which means fixing this on 3-2-maintenance would be tricky.

I know there are a few issues around filtering shared_examples (#1837, rspec/rspec#9). I'm not sure if this is related but we're having an issue where specifying a single spec is running that spec plus all shared examples in the file are ran. I've boiled this down to a change from 3.2.1 to 3.2.2 (by adding `gem rspec-core 3.2.1/3.2.2`). It's also occurring in 3.2.3 where we first noticed it. \n\nThe shared example must be declared in an external file. When it was in the same file it was not happening. \n\nI can set up a whole example project to recreate but here is the smallest example I can provide. Sorry for bleeding in the fact I'm obviously using rspec-rails and in a client project. \n\n```\n#spec/support/sharing_is_caring.rb\n\nshared_examples \"sharing is caring\" do\n  describe \"a context\" do\n    it \"is a sample test\" do\n      expect(true).to be true\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n```\n#spec/controllers/test_spec.rb\n\nrequire 'rails_helper'\n\ndescribe \"test runner runs tests\" do\n  it \"has a its own test too\" do\n    expect(true).to be true\n  end\n\n  it_behaves_like \"sharing is caring\"\nend\n```\n\nIn with rspec-core >= 3.2.3 I get the following output.\n\n```\njhirn@MacBook-Pro ~/s/d/mme (consolidate_mentor_group_user_association)> bundle exec rspec ./spec/controllers/test_spec.rb:4\nRun options: include {:locations=>{\"./spec/controllers/test_spec.rb\"=>[4]}}\n 2/2 |======================================================= 100 ========================================================>| Time: 00:00:00\n\nFinished in 0.20333 seconds (files took 3.31 seconds to load)\n2 examples, 0 failures\n```\n\nAs you can see, two tests are executed rather than the `it \"has a its own test too\" do` spec which is on line 4 .\n\nLet me know what other information I can provide and thank you for your time.
