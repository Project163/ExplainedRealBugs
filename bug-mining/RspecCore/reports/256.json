I tracked it down to the fact that the fivemat formatter (which I was using) wasn't handling the `message` event.  RSpec was trying to notify that `--only-failures` wasn't configured properly yet:\n\nhttps://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/5375dcdfdb5460a51d5003de76eb124997fa26ea/lib/rspec/core/world.rb#L170-L174\n\n...which notifies via `message`:\n\nhttps://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/5375dcdfdb5460a51d5003de76eb124997fa26ea/lib/rspec/core/reporter.rb#L181-L185\n\n...but since the formatter didn't listen to that message it silently exited.\n\nThis was bad UX.\n\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here.  I have a PR out to fix the fivemat formatter (tpope/fivemat#24) but there may be other formatters that don't support `message` properly.  Maybe we should treat `message` as special and if no formatter handles that message fall back to `$stdout.puts` so that no message ever drops on the floor?\n","closed_by":{"login":"JonRowe","id":162976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JonRowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
