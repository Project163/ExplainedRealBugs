The code implementing a transaction block typically rescues Exception and rolls the transaction back -- thus any failing test will get a rollback. But throw/catch defeats this, since throwing does not execute any rescue block while unwinding the stack.This is a problem for examples of the form:\n\n```\npending do\n  # database operations\nend\n```\n\nThese will fail to roll back the database operations.\n\nIs it possible to implement `pending` with standard exceptions rather than throw/catch?\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
