This assumes the `bundle` and/or `spec` commands are available via the `$PATH` environment variable.\n\nRubinius does not actually expose the bin-scripts of installed gems. Instead, Rubinius requires you run commands via `rbx -S command here`.\n\nA better solution is to execute the rspec runner command using `Rake::FileUtils#ruby` and prefix the command with a `-S` flag.\n\nPatch: http://github.com/postmodern/rspec-core/commit/7a08cc87c77b81664a612881d756d9a5a29cf0c5\n\nTested against edge Rubinius and Ruby 1.9.2-p0.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
