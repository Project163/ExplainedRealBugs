This way I could just copy&paste the line reference and rerun it, but as it currently is, I have to search in the output before the summary to really see what examples didn't run.\n\n``` ruby\nFailed examples:\n\nrspec ./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:6 # Breadcrumbs logged in as admin user Users behaves like a page with #index breadcrumbs shows the expected breadcrumbs\nrspec ./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:16 # Breadcrumbs logged in as admin user Users behaves like a page with #new breadcrumbs shows the expected breadcrumbs\nrspec ./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:28 # Breadcrumbs logged in as admin user Users behaves like a page with #create breadcrumbs shows the expected breadcrumbs\nrspec ./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:45 # Breadcrumbs logged in as admin user Users behaves like a page with #show breadcrumbs shows the expected breadcrumbs\nrspec ./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:59 # Breadcrumbs logged in as admin user Users behaves like a page with #edit breadcrumbs shows the expected breadcrumbs\nrspec ./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:75 # Breadcrumbs logged in as admin user Users behaves like a page with #update breadcrumbs shows the expected breadcrumbs\n```\n\nAlso, the very useful gem https://github.com/oggy/respec (which let's you re-run failed examples using `respec f`) uses the line reference to remember failed examples. This works perfectly for \"normal\" examples, but for shared examples, it's useless.\n\nContent of `.rspec_failures`:\n\n```\n./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:6\n./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:16\n./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:28\n./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:45\n./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:59\n./spec/support/breadcrumbs.rb:75\n```\n\nIs there a way to fix this? Or am I doing something wrong? It's convenient to have shared examples in their own external files in `spec/support` so they are loaded automatically **before** any other test is.
