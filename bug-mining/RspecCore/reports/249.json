I find the profile information useful but I only occasionally look at it. I _always_ want to see the summary/rerun commands immediately after the tests finish. So I find it annoying having to scroll up to see the summary.\n\nIt appears that RSpec's original order matched my preferences and that the change was introduced in [#1515](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/1515). You can clearly see the order before that PR was profile, summary line, then rerun commands:\n\n``` ruby\ndef dump_summary(summary)\n  dump_profile unless mute_profile_output?(summary.failure_count)\n  output.puts \"\\nFinished in #{summary.formatted_duration}\" +\n  \" (files took #{summary.formatted_load_time} to load)\\n\"\n  output.puts summary.colorize_with ConsoleCodes\n  dump_commands_to_rerun_failed_examples\nend\n```\n\nHowever, the PR changed it so the dump_profile happens after dumping the summary:\n\n``` ruby\n# @method dump_profile\n# @api public\n#\n# This method is invoked after the dumping the summary if profiling is\n# enabled.\n```\n\nWould you consider changing it back to the original order or adding an option to swap the order?\n","closed_by":{"login":"JonRowe","id":162976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JonRowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
