is a first pass at closing rspec/rspec-core#17 by adding support for RSpec.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nFor Rspec users the setup is slightly different than minitest.\r\n\r\n(In rails_helper.rb or spec_helper.rb)\r\n```ruby\r\n# Add Deprecation Toolkit library\r\nrequire 'deprecation_toolkit/rspec'\r\n\r\nRSpec.configure do |config|\r\n  config.deprecation_behavior = :raise\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso it's worth noting that RSpec doesn't support adding custom flags when running tests. So you won't be able to add `--record-deprecations` when running your specs, but instead recording / raising  would have to be changed at the config level (like above).\r\n\r\nFor that I've made a small DSL so you can pass in a symbol of (`:raise`, `:record`, or :`disabled`).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Still to do\r\nI mostly want to open this PR to get some early feedback and see if this approach makes sense.
