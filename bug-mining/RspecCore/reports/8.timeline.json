And I do prefer the 1.9.2 way.\nBut the change was not made to make people use `./spec/file.rb` instead of `spec/file.rb`.\nThe change was made to stop confusion when requiring a script (I believe).\n\nIn all command line tools (general meaning), how much don't accept relative path? Well I don't know a single one that I use frequently. And I do use the shell ;)\n\nbtw, `ruby spec/my_spec.rb` works if you require the libs and 'rspec' yourself.\nSo, clearly, `rspec` is just more handy to run specs.\nIt's a cool feature it adds ./lib to the $LOAD_PATH.\nBut then why should we use an absolute path? Why should we need this './' ?\n\nSo, clearly, adding '.' to the $LOAD_PATH is a bad idea.\nBut I think that `File.expand_path(file)` for the ARGV given to the script is reasonable (and probably even more secure).\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nP.S.: About the patch proposed, maybe it should be better `files_to_run` to be only absolute paths, so they are expanded when interpreted from the command line.\n(in Configuration.files_or_directories_to_run= I think is the best.\nAdding `file = File.expand_path(file)` before the 'if' by example)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/254526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eregon","id":168854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon","html_url":"https://github.com/eregon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eregon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/254703","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/28#issuecomment-254703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/28","id":254703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDcwMw==","user":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-05-26T19:28:21Z","updated_at":"2010-05-26T19:28:21Z","body":"The problem with using absolute paths is that's what gets stored for backtraces.
