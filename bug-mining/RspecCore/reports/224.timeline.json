Add new `include_chain_clauses_in_custom_matcher_descriptions`\n  config option. It will default to `true` in RSpec 4 so we\n  have not put it in the commented-out section.\n- Move `verify_partial_doubles` config option into non-commented\n  out section as well. I want to default it to `true` in RSpec 4\n  as well.\n- Switch from `syntax` config options to `disable_monkey_patching!`\n\nFixes #1645.\n\n/cc @oveddan\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":144739786,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NDczOTc4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/144739786","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b5ea0e658cac04e42f28652c9e99b38167597407","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/commits/b5ea0e658cac04e42f28652c9e99b38167597407","created_at":"2014-07-23T16:36:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":145236046,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ1MjM2MDQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/145236046","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-24T17:11:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3941609583,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5NDE2MDk1ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/3941609583","actor":{"login":"MatheusRich","id":20938712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTM4NzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20938712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich","html_url":"https://github.com/MatheusRich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatheusRich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6a368257dd1819205b048a67e76d1f0e3edb19b5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MatheusRich/rspec-core/commits/6a368257dd1819205b048a67e76d1f0e3edb19b5","created_at":"2020-10-30T14:50:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
