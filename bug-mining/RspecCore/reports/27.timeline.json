first cut at pushed to this branch:\n\nhttp://github.com/wincent/rspec-core/commits/issue-74\n\nSpecifically this commit:\n\nhttp://github.com/wincent/rspec-core/commit/8ff5f2d05f37495b2b724535488fceca8bab0466\n\nThis commit basically just to show that it works. I'd like to remove the duplication, however, wherein the `alias_it_should_behave_like_to` method contains a near-verbatim copy of the `it_should_behave_like` method.\n\nNot sure which way you'd like to remove this duplication, but the way I'd do it would be something like the following:\n\nMake a new method, similar to `define_example_method`, which actually includes the shared examples. This method would be called something like `include_shared_examples` and it would take the shared example group name, the \"reporting label\", and the customization block as parameters. Something like:\n\n```\ndef include_shared_examples(name, report_label = 'it should behave like', &customization_block)\n  shared_block = world.shared_example_groups[name]\n  raise \"Could not find shared example group named #{name.inspect}\" unless shared_block\n\n  shared_group = describe(\"#{report_label} #{name}\", &shared_block)\n  shared_group.class_eval &customization_block if customization_block\n  shared_group\nend\n```\n\n`it_should_behave_like` and `alias_it_should_behave_like_to` would then just delegate to this method, boiling down to basically:\n\n```\ndef self.it_should_behave_like(name, &customization_block)\n  include_shared_examples(name, &customization_block)\nend\n\ndef self.alias_it_should_behave_like_to(new_name, report_label)\n  module_eval(<<-END_RUBY, __FILE__, __LINE__)\n    def self.#{new_name}(name, &customization_block)\n      include_shared_examples(name, #{report_label.inspect}, &customization_block)\n    end\n  END_RUBY\nend\n```\n\nHaven't actually done it yet (typed in browser, so usual disclaimers apply). What would you do?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/316770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wincent","id":7074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent","html_url":"https://github.com/wincent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wincent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/316806","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/74#issuecomment-316806","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/74","id":316806,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjgwNg==","user":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-07-18T11:18:06Z","updated_at":"2010-07-18T11:18:06Z","body":"How
