hooks are documented as being responsible to run the example:\n\nhttp://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Hooks#around-instance_method\n\nHowever, it's an easy thing to forget, and when it's forgotten it can be quite confusing (see #1581 for an example).  To help people avoid this mistake, I think it would be useful if we gave them an error or warning when the example has not been run.  We can figure this out by keeping track on the yielded example object of whether or not `run` has been called or not.\n\nA couple open issues/questions:\n- Error or warning?  I would generally lean towards an error for things like this.  However, we probably can't do that in a minor release as it'll be a breaking change (although, it'll probably alert them to a real problem).  A warning, on the otherhand, seems OK to add in a minor release.\n- It's conceivable that some users may choose not to run the example in an around hook as a way of skipping the example.  We have first class APIs to skip so doing that is pretty non-standard but it's something to keep in mind.  This also suggests it should be a warning.\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
