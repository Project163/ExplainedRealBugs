(My preferred solution).\n\nThat changes the semantics of the class, though.  Structs provide definitions of `==`, `eql?` and `hash` based on the values of the attributes passed to `Struct.new`.  If we specifically do not want those semantics for a class than we should change to `attr_reader` and `initialize` like you said, but otherwise, it'd be a breaking change.  Why do you dislike the for I suggest above so much?  I understand it's a bit unorthodox but it preserves the semantics of the class (which, for existing structs that are part of our public API is very important, IMO).  It doesn't bother me at all.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/61827552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/61905187","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1765#issuecomment-61905187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1765","id":61905187,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTA1MTg3","user":{"login":"JonRowe","id":162976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe","html_url":"https://github.com/JonRowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonRowe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-06T00:02:06Z","updated_at":"2014-11-06T00:02:06Z","body":">  Why do you dislike the for I suggest above so much?
