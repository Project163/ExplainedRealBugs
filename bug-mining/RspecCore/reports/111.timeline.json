updated a work project to HEAD and immediately ran into a bunch of `NoMethodError`:\n\n```\n     NoMethodError:\n       undefined method `fetch_or_store' for nil:NilClass\n```\n\nI traced it down to a poorly written spec of mine that did the equivalent of:\n\n``` ruby\nlet(:redis) { logic_to_get_redis_instance }\nbefore do\n  MyJobPipeline.configure do |c|\n    c.define_redis_instance_for { |key| redis }\n  end\nend\n```\n\nCalling `define_redis_instance_for` mutates `MyJobPipeline` global state.  I should be resetting it back after the examples but forgot to.  The `define_redis_instance_for` blocks retains a reference to the example, and calls `redis` on it each time `MyJobPipeline` invokes the configured block.\n\nBefore #1858 was merged, this poorly written spec didn't cause problems, since `__memoized` was deifned as `@__memoized ||= {}` -- so if the variable was `nil`, it would merely get re-initialized to a blank hash.  As of #1858, we no longer have the `||= {}` logic -- instead `@__memoized` is eagerly initialized.   After the example completes, all instance variables are set to `nil` (see b51be2c42b5cd281549ee0af2af455d304b92b04 which addressed #321), so the when the `let` method is invoked after the example has completed, it raises a `NoMethodError`.\n\nUltimately, my spec is buggy and should be fixed (and I will) but the experience of RSpec raising a `NoMethodError` in this case is poor and I think we should address that, too.  If I can accidentally forget to reset the global state like this, users can, too.\n\nThe question is...how do we address this w/o bringing back the memory leak of #321?\n\nI'm thinking that maybe we can remove the clearing of the ivars entirely, and instead figure out what's retaining a reference to the example group instance and clear that instead.  That should be faster, anyway as it's only 1 thing to clear instead of N things (for N ivars).\n\nAny reason that wouldn't work?  @dchelimsky, when fixing #321, did you consider the route of clearing the reference to the example group instance rather than clearing the instance's references to its ivars?  (If you don't remember, as would be totally reasonable, that's fine, but figured I'd ask).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1921/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":291612076,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTYxMjA3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/291612076","actor":{"login":"JoshCheek","id":77495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshCheek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6b101e16d7b49c164bc147ff50745d040f9e05c6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JoshCheek/rspec-core/commits/6b101e16d7b49c164bc147ff50745d040f9e05c6","created_at":"2015-04-28T05:40:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":291613097,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTYxMzA5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/291613097","actor":{"login":"JoshCheek","id":77495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshCheek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"58c25745e711c35389dea106c1a9d0b2e1ce7a57","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JoshCheek/rspec-core/commits/58c25745e711c35389dea106c1a9d0b2e1ce7a57","created_at":"2015-04-28T05:43:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":291613948,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTYxMzk0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/291613948","actor":{"login":"JoshCheek","id":77495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshCheek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"000214dc5575b912733d8662303c48c1371da9b9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JoshCheek/rspec-core/commits/000214dc5575b912733d8662303c48c1371da9b9","created_at":"2015-04-28T05:44:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":291614248,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTYxNDI0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/291614248","actor":{"login":"JoshCheek","id":77495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshCheek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshChee

this by no longer clearing the example's ivars.\n\nFixes rspec/rspec-core#1921\n## Context\n- Originally clearing ivars due to memory leak:\n  https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/321\n- Threadsafe memoized helpers caused `__memoized` to stop lazily initializing:\n  https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/321\n- This caused it to be permawiped by by the resetting of the example's ivars:\n  https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1921\n\nHowever, this patch tests the behaviour of the memory leak,\nrather than its mechanics, which shows that it was fixed at some point.\nSo we simply remove that
