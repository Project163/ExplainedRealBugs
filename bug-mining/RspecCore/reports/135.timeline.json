I _have_ to use `skip_bundler` to allow the warnings to be printed (which I want--I'm trying to keep VCR warning-free these days).\n\nSo...I think it'd be nice to keep a `skip_bundler` option that can

The `-w` issue is just an example of one case where I found `skip_bundler` useful.  I imagine there will be other times in the future where it may prove useful.\n\nI think I'm OK with using `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` to detect the default setting of whether or not `bundle exec` should be used, but I also like the flexibility of keeping the `skip_bundler` option.
