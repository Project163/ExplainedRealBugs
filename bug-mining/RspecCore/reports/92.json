Is it possible to make an option to disable such a behaviour?\n\nTwo reasons:\n- I may want to make something else without bundler but with file Gemfile in my root directory. Sure enough, that's a bad idea, but I don't want my specs to break.\n- Bundler takes a loooooong time to preload. I lose a great deal of performance whenever `bundle exec` is called\n\nI think it is safe to assume bundler exec to be a reasonable default for testing but there could be a case when I want to disable that behaviour.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
