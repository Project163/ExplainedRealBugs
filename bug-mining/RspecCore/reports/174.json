I don't expect RSpec to run any examples at all. Yet when I run this file I get:\n\n```\n$ rspec weird_spec.rb -f d\n\na car\n  makes noise\n\nFinished in 0.00029 seconds\n1 example, 0 failures\n```\n\nIt appears that this problem is entirely caused by the ':foo => true' metadata on the shared example and the spec. If I remove ':foo =>  true', from `shared_examples`, or remove it from `describe`, or change its value so that the `shared_example` and the `describe` have different 'foo' values, then RSpec works as expected.\n\nRSpec 2.6.4.\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
