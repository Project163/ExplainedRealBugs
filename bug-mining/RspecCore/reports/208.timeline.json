precision. This often\nleads to a confusing failure message when two time objects differ by\nfractional seconds. The matcher returns a failure but the diff shows\nidentical values. Microseconds have been added to the diff output for\n`Time`.\n\nBy default `DateTime#inspect` outputs enough precision to prevent this\nproblem. `ActiveSupport` monkey patches `#inspect` to print a more human\nreadable but ambiguous representation. If `ActiveSupport` is defined a\ncustom format string is used for `DateTime` that has enough precision\nto differentiate the two objects.\n\nFixes

IMO this behavior is non-intuitive.  rspec/rspec-core#1114 seems to have made an exception for when the inner describe is an instance of String, which makes sense, because `described_class.should be_a(Class)`.  However, I argue that this should be consistent for all cases where the inner describe is not a Class.  Either take its class, or skip it and move to the outer describe block, but don't return an instance.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec/issues/31/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec/issues/31/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/52551911","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1114#issuecomment-52551911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1114","id":52551911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTUxOTEx","user":{"login":"rkh","id":30442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh","html_url":"https://github.com/rkh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-18T20:41:41Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T21:06:14Z","body":"I think this broke the following behavior:\n\n``` ruby\ndescribe SomeClass do\n  subject(:some_instance) { described_class.new }\n  describe :some_method do\n    example \"some behavior\" do\n      expect(some_instance).to ...\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nMakes upgrading complex test suits a pain, especially since 2.99 does not warn about the change.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/52551911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rkh","id":30442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh","html_url":"https://github.com/rkh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/52552803","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1114#issuecomment-52552803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1114","id":52552803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTUyODAz","user":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-18T20:48:41Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T20:48:41Z","body":"@rkh -- Yep, we definitely broke that.
