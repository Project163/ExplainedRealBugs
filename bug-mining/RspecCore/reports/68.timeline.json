Sometimes having the older RSpec gems floating around causes problems. Try running\n\n```\n$ gem list rspec\n```\n\nand remove everything there that is related to RSpec 2.0.0. This will involve not only <tt>rspec</tt> and <tt>rspec-rails</tt>, but also <tt>rspec-core</tt>, <tt>rspec-mocks</tt>, and <tt>rspec-expectations</tt>:\n\n```\n$ gem uninstall rspec-expectations -v 2.0.0\n```\n\nand so on.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/482574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"railstutorial","id":35562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial","html_url":"https://github.com/railstutorial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/railstutorial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/482597","html_url":"https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/184#issuecomment-482597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/184","id":482597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjU5Nw==","user":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-10-21T01:37:03Z","updated_at":"2010-10-21T01:37:03Z","body":"Thank you for finding that.
