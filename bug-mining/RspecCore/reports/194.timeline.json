This results in the following metadata hash for our example:\n\n```\n{\n    :caller => ...,\n    :description => \"should == \\\"an object\\\"\", \n    :description_args = [], \n    :example_group => ..., \n    :example_group_block => #<Proc: ...>, \n    :execution_result => ...,\n}\n```\n\nNo `:full_description` entry in sight.\n\nThis means that, when someone calls `example.description` after the test is run, they get the generated matcher description, because the implementation of `Example#description` sees that `metadata[:description]` is set. But when someone calls `example.full_description` or `example.metadata[:full_description]`, both fall through to this implementation, from the `ExampleMetadata` module:\n\n``` ruby\ndef full_description\n  build_description_from(self[:example_group][:full_description], *self[:description_args])\nend\n```\n\nHmm... I see the parent's full description, the empty list of description_args... but where's the example's description itself? We're not taking into account that in this case the description didn't come from the args at all, it came from the generated matcher. That, I believe, is the root cause.\n\nI think the best behavior is to respect the description args above all, but _only if they're given_. Failing that, we should use the generated description if it's available, and then we do I dunno what (stick with the above, or go back to \"example at ...\"). Going with this behavior would fix my issue.\n\nSo, my suggested fix is to have `#full_description` take `metadata[:description]` into account:\n\n``` ruby\ndef full_description\n  if self[:description]\n    build_description_from(self[:example_group][:full_description], self[:description])\n  else\n    build_description_from(self[:example_group][:full_description], *self[:description_args])\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIt's not the cleanest patch, because it appears on the surface to be undermining the behavior I described above, prioritizing whatever it finds in `self[:description]`, generated or otherwise, above `self[:description_args]`. However, it does fix my issue, and I'm not sure how better to express it. If `metadata[:description]` is set, I think it could contain either the contents of `metadata[:description_args]` or the generated matcher description (any other possibilities?). And it looks to me from `Example#assign_generated_description` that if `metadata[:description]` is already filled out (from the description args), the previous contents will win. So really, I think what you're going to see is: if we fall through to the else, `self[:description_args]` is going to be empty. But I have yet to prove that.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/comments/15596752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ods94065","id":75564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065","html_url":"https://github.com/ods94065","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ods94065/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":44514615,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0NDUxNDYxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/44514615","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-04-09T10:26:44Z","assignee":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":44519842,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0NTE5ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/events/44519842","actor":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"882c314bda413ec9b2de35c986f3a6913d423cc8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/commits/882c314bda413ec9b2de35c986f3a6913d423cc8","created_at":"2013-04-09T11:24:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","fol
