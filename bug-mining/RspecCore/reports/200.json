My initial thought was that there were 130 lines from the prior test run (even though it should overwrite the file each test run), so I deleted it an ran again.  Same deal.  (Actually, on the first time it had ~ 205 lines of the same deprecation. The 136 lines above was from the second time).\n\nThere are a few problems here:\n- The `6 deprecations logged to ./log/rspec-deprecations.log` message is totally wrong compared to what printed.  Actually, looking at my code -- I think that particular call site was encountered 6 times during the run, so that's my guess of where 6 times came from.\n- Given it was the same call site each time, the deprecation message was identical.  I don't think there's any reason to ever print the same identical deprecation message more than once, no matter how many times it's call site is executed.\n- There's some really odd bug causing _a lot_ of extra duplicates to show up in the deprecation output file.  No idea why.\n\n/cc @soulcutter \n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
