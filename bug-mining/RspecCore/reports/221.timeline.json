That doesn't seem completely correct. See the output for this on RSpec 3.0.0.rc1:\n\nThat output is exactly what I'd expect.  What is incorrect about what I said?\n\n> Either you'd need to check the grand-parent, or if this is a loop, it'll take one more iteration cycle.\n\n...or check to see if the `:parent_example_group` return value is an empty hash, as @janko-m mentioned.\n\n> @myronmarston since your initial intent was for the null object pattern, I'm not sure the current implementation fits. You will eventually hit a nil. Thoughts?\n\nYeah, I'm thinking that it was probably a mistake.  At this point, I think I'd rather it not set the empty hash.  I'm of two minds of whether or not we should change it, though:\n- This doesn't exactly fall into the category of \"bug fix\" changes we're focused on now for 3.0.0 final.\n- However, this would be a breaking change post 3.0 and thus this change couldn't be made after 3.0 final comes out until 4.0.  (Unless we want to introduce a config option....and I don't want to go there).\n- That said, with 3.0.0.rc1 out for less than a week it's highly unlikely anyone relies upon this behavior yet.  Put another way: right now is the moment when this change will cause the least amount of pain...the longer we wait, the more pain this will cause as the more 3rd-party things may rely on the current behavior.\n\nI _think_ my instinct is that the community would be best served by making this change but I'm on the fence about given the semi-breaking nature of this change I'm on the fence.\n\nThoughts from @JonRowe / @xaviershay / @samphippen /

That output is exactly what I'd expect. What is incorrect about what I said?\n\nI think it was my interpretation of how things were worded. I would have expected `[:parent_example_group]` to always return `{}`.\n\nI agree this is something we should fix before GA. If we don't think it is the behavior we should have, even if we originally intended it fix a specific problem, I think it's still a bug. To me, this is a design flaw of a behavior change. In general, I view design flaws as :bug:s, since they don't fully meet the original requirement.
