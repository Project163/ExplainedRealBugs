is a followup to #1474.\n\nGiven this spec file:\n\n``` ruby\nRSpec.describe \"Foo\" do\n  context \"when bar\" do\n    it \"does one thing on 1.8\", :if => RUBY_VERSION < '1.9' do\n      expect(RUBY_VERSION).to be < '1.9'\n    end\n\n    it 'does something else on 1.9+', :unless => RUBY_VERSION < '1.9' do\n      expect(RUBY_VERSION).to be >= '1.9'\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI would expect `bin/rspec -e \"when bar\"` to run only one of the examples -- the first one if running ruby 1.8, and the 2nd otherwise.  This worked in 2.x but is now broken in master.  I git bisected it and found the culprit is ffd904cfa6e325c59362c3bdf272d67bf9e63311 from PR #1195 by @JonRowe.\n","closed_by":{"login":"myronmarston","id":49391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston","html_url":"https://github.com/myronmarston","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/1484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
