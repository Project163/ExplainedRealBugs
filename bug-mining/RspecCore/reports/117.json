After it finishes, the specs and results are not discarded. Invoking `RSpec::Core::Runner.run` repeatedly yields output with the specs doubled/tripled/etc. Is there a way to make RSpec discard the results of a run in order to start fresh at the next invocation?\n\nEDIT: It's not only the specs that are doubled, the results are as well. I think this might be because the test/implementation files have already been `require`d and are thus not reloaded by the second invocation.\n\nMy use case is that I want to notify the user that something went wrong via growl/libnotify when s/he is doing BDD. To do that, I need the last Exception RSpec raised (if any), and I found wrapping RSpec::Core::Runner.run into `begin`, `rescue`, `end` to be the simplest way to achieve this.\n\nDemonstration:\n\n```\n$ rspec --version\n2.5.2\n$ irb\n>> require 'rspec'\n=> true\n>> RSpec::Core::Runner.run(['spec'], STDERR, STDOUT)\n\nAscii85\n  #encode\n    should [...]\n  #decode\n    should [...]\n\nFinished in 0.07314 seconds\n14 examples, 0 failures\n=> true\n>> RSpec::Core::Runner.run(['spec'], STDERR, STDOUT)\n/home/datawraith/projects/Ascii85/spec/lib/ascii85_spec.rb:7: warning: already initialized constant TEST_CASES\n\nAscii85\n  #encode\n    should [...]\n  #decode\n    should [...]\n\nAscii85\n  #encode\n    should [...]\n  #decode\n    should [...]\n\nFinished in 0.09018 seconds\n42 examples, 0 failures\n=> true\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"dchelimsky","id":1075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky","html_url":"https://github.com/dchelimsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rspec/rspec-core/issues/367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
