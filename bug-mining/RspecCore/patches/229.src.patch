-  Scenario: `subject` in top level group
+  A named `subject` improves on the explicit `subject` by assigning it a contextually
+  semantic name. Since a named `subject` is an explicit `subject`, it still defines the value
+  that is returned by the `subject` method in the example scope. However, it defines an
+  additional helper method with the provided name. This helper method is memoized.
+  The value is cached across multiple calls in the same example but not across examples.
+
+  We recommend using the named helper method over `subject` in examples.
+
+  For more information about declaring a `subject` see the [API docs](http://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/MemoizedHelpers/ClassMethods#subject-instance_method).
