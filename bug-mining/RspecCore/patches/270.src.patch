+Feature: filter_run_when_matching
+
+  You can configure a _conditional_ filter that only applies if there are any matching
+  examples using `config.filter_run_when_matching`. This is commonly used for focus
+  filtering:
+
+  ```ruby
+  RSpec.configure do |c|
+    c.filter_run_when_matching :focus
+  end
+  ```
+
+  This configuration allows you to filter to specific examples or groups by tagging
+  them with `:focus` metadata. When no example or groups are focused (which should be
+  the norm since it's intended to be a temporary change), the filter will be ignored.
+
+  RSpec also provides aliases--`fit`, `fdescribe` and `fcontext`--as a shorthand for
+  `it`, `describe` and `context` with `:focus` metadata, making it easy to temporarily
+  focus an example or group by prefixing an `f`.
+
+  Background:
+    Given a file named "spec/spec_helper.rb" with:
+      """ruby
+      RSpec.configure do |c|
+        c.filter_run_when_matching :focus
+      end
+      """
+    And a file named ".rspec" with:
+      """
+      --require spec_helper
+      """
+    And a file named "spec/example_spec.rb" with:
+      """ruby
+      RSpec.describe "A group" do
+        it "has a passing example" do
+        end
+
+        context "a nested group" do
+          it "also has a passing example" do
+          end
+        end
+      end
+      """
+
+  Scenario: The filter is ignored when nothing is focused
+    When I run `rspec --format doc`
+    Then it should pass with "2 examples, 0 failures"
+    And the output should contain:
+      """
