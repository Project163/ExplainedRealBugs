+### `context` is no longer a top-level method
+
+We removed `context` from the main object because it was creating conflicts with
+IRB and some users who had `Context` domain objects. `describe` is still there,
+so if you want to use `context` at the top level, just alias it:
+
+    alias :context, :describe
+
+Of course, you can still use `context` to declare a nested group:
+
+    describe "something" do
+      context "in some context" do
+        it "does something" do
+          # ...
+        end
+      end
+    end
