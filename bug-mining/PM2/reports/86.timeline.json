Debian 9, windows 8/10, OSX\r\nPM2: 3.2.4\r\n\r\nI have a fork with a work in progress branch that solves some minor issues running\r\nscripts on windows and linux.\r\n\r\nWe run a mixture of windows and linux on the desktop.  I am trying to use pm2\r\nto run some processes in dev mode. One of these is `webpack -d --watch`.\r\n\r\nAfter an npm install webpack gets set up like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp/\r\n   node_modules/\r\n      .bin/\r\n         webpack              # this is a shell script\r\n         webpack.cmd          # windows cmd file\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly common pattern (git-windows, ruby etc) follow to make the\r\n`whatever` command work on both platforms. Linux will find the shell script,\r\nwindows will find (and prefer) the cmd so when you issue `webpack` the right\r\none gets run.\r\n\r\nTo make things a little harder, webpack is installed in the root of the app but\r\nneeds to be called from sub-folders. We get around this with `yarn run` which\r\ndoes the same as `npm run` and puts the right node_modules/.bin on the path to\r\nfind the command.\r\n\r\nI tried this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    script: 'yarn',\r\n    args: [ 'webpack', '-d', '--watch'],\r\n    interpreter: 'none'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it fails to start webpack because it tries to spawm: `C:\\PROGRAM FILES (X86)\\YARN\\BIN\\YARN.CMD`\r\nwhich triggers a `C:\\PROGRAM not found` because it's not correctly quoted/escaped.\r\n\r\nI tried:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    script: 'yarn webpack',\r\n    args: [ '-d', '--watch'],\r\n    interpreter: 'none'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    script: '\"c:/program files (x86)/yarn/bin/yarn\"',\r\n    args: ['weback', '-d', '--watch'],\r\n    interpreter: 'none'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut both give an error 'bash and sh not available in $PATH' from [Common.js]\r\nbecause there are spaces in the command. Much like #3767 which is closed for\r\nthe specific case of backslash but not in general.\r\n\r\nI tried a few more and hit #2037 trying to launch the cmd directly.\r\n\r\nUsing the full path to the webpack main js file works\r\n`../node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js` and since the pm2 config is js, I could\r\nwrite code to export the right structure based on os.platform so I think there\r\nare solutions without changing pm2.\r\n\r\nI looked though the code and figured we could make\r\nspawn use the shell itself which makes commands with spaces cross platform\r\n(#3767), allows it to work on windows with scripts that are not js (e.g\r\ngit-windows, ruby) and (I think) will solve launching a .cmd file as well\r\n(#2037).\r\n\r\nThis does remove the ipc handle when the script has interpreter 'none',\r\nbut AFAIK the ipc is only supported when the child is node see [node docs].\r\n\r\nThe results of my investigation are here:\r\nhttps://github.com/CityScience/pm2/pull/1/files.\r\n\r\nBefore I go further, I wanted to ask:\r\n\r\n1. Is this a positive change to make?\r\n2. If so, should it apply to 'none' or add a new interpreter option so that\r\n   none remains backward compatible?\r\n3. Aside from adding some tests and updating the docs is there anything else?\r\n\r\n[node docs]: https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_options_stdio\r\n[Common.js]:

./server\r\n\r\nTried also use /usr/bin/make && ./server but it doesn't work too.\r\nIf I run ./server separately that works\r\nI suppose I can use sh file to run both command but make you know the
