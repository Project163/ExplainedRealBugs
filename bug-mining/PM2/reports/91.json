There the import statement is attempting to import the ESM script using the file path instead of a file scheme.\r\n\r\n## How could we reproduce this issue?\r\nTry starting a script within an ES module package: `pm2.start ('reference/to/esm-package/script.js')`, then find the error in the `err` file for the process. \r\n\r\n## Supporting information\r\nPM2 version:  v4.4.1\r\nNode version: v13.7.0\r\nOS: windows\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind submitting a PR for a fix. It simply requires converting the given path to a file URL using `url.pathToFileURL()`.\r\nSo, instead of `import(process.env.pm_exec_path);`, we should now have `import(url.pathToFileURL(process.env.pm_exec_path));`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Unitech","id":757747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Nzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/757747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/4839/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/4839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
