I start a process, then stop it and delete it. I no longer see the process in `pm2 list`. If I try starting the process again, I see errors indicating ports are already used (similar to #350 ). I check for processes on those ports using the `netstat` command and manually kill them. At this point, if I check `pm2 list` again, the process is back on the list.\n\nA few times I've been able to stop and delete the process, then just wait a while, check `pm2 list` again and see that the process is back on the list.\n\nPM2 version: 0.9.5\nNodeJS version: v0.10.30\nOS Version: Ubuntu 14.04\n\nHere's the file I use when starting PM2:\n\n``` json\n {\n  \"apps\" : [\n  {\n    \"name\"   : \"web\",\n    \"script\" : \"/usr/bin/node-debug\",\n    \"args\": \"['index.js', '--debug-brk=false']\",\n    \"exec_mode\" : \"fork_mode\",\n    \"exec_interpreter\": \"none\",\n    \"ignoreWatch\" : [\"client\"],\n    \"watch\"       : \"./\",\n    \"env\" : {\n        \"NODE_ENV\":\"development\",\n        \"PORT\": 8000\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\" : \"SASS\",\n    \"script\" : \"/home/vagrant/.gem/ruby/2.1.0/bin/sass\",\n    \"args\": \"['--watch', 'client/styles/sass/main.scss:client/styles/main.css']\",\n    \"exec_mode\" : \"fork_mode\",\n    \"exec_interpreter\": \"none\"\n  }\n  ]\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"soyuka","id":1321971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka","html_url":"https://github.com/soyuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
