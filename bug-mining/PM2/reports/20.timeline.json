haven't found anything about this security topic mentioned before, so here is an issue to talk about it.\n\nAt this time it's possible to start `pm2` with a dedicated user, and it's good.\n\nBut :\n- the `pm2` process can be killed by any user simply logged on the production system: `pm2 kill`\n- all the applications managed by `pm2` can be listed/stopped by any user simply logged on the production system: `pm2 list`, `pm2 stop all`\n\nA possible security model could be based on filesystem rights. This is very Unix. When called, `pm2` could check the calling user rights on the `.pm2` directory:\n- If the calling user has read rights on the `.pm2` directory (i.e. can open `r` the directory) → the user is allowed to run `pm2 list`\n- If the calling user has write rights on the `.pm2` directory  (i.e. can open `w` the directory) → the user is allowed to run `pm2 stop`\n\nThat way all the permissions will be dealt on the filesystem level. What do you think?\n\nCheers,\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/260/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":152856596,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1Mjg1NjU5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/events/152856596","actor":{"login":"Unitech","id":757747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Nzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/757747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c865318d2bbc51ea29388e189741ee80aa73a191","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/commits/c865318d2bbc51ea29388e189741ee80aa73a191","created_at":"2014-08-14T13:40:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":156215627,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTU2MjE1NjI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/events/156215627","actor":{"login":"Unitech","id":757747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Nzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/757747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c865318d2bbc51ea29388e189741ee80aa73a191","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/commits/c865318d2bbc51ea29388e189741ee80aa73a191","created_at":"2014-08-22T18:36:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/comments/311440616","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/487#issuecomment-311440616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/487","id":311440616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMTQ0MDYxNg==","user":{"login":"luciomr","id":5596085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1OTYwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5596085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr","html_url":"https://github.com/luciomr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luciomr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-27T18:12:51Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T18:12:51Z","body":"@soyuka 's comment pointed me to the right path.\r\n\r\nI had previously installed pm2 globally, and then I was using it locally in an app. Turns out that my ~/.pm2 folder was only accessible to the root user (root created this folder when I was running pm2 globally).
