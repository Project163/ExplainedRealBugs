If a script does not need to listen to a connection, it can manually tell PM2 that the process has started up by calling `process.send(\\'online\\')`.\\n\\n<a name=\"a8\"/>\\n## Startup script\\n\\nPM2 has the amazing ability to **generate startup scripts and configure them**.\\nPM2 is also smart enough to **save all your process list** and to **bring back all your processes on restart**.\\n\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 startup [ubuntu|centos|gentoo|systemd]\\n`\\n\\nOnce you have started the apps and want to keep them on server reboot do:\\n\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 save\\n`\\n\\n**Warning** It\\'s tricky to make this feature work generically, so once PM2 has setup your startup script, reboot your server to make sure that PM2 has launched your apps!\\n\\n### More information\\n\\nThree types of startup scripts are available:\\n\\n- SystemV init script (with the option `ubuntu` or `centos`)\\n- OpenRC init script (with the option `gentoo`)\\n- SystemD init script (with the `systemd` option)\\n\\nThe startup options are using:\\n\\n- **ubuntu** will use `updaterc.d` and the script `lib/scripts/pm2-init.sh`\\n- **centos** will use `chkconfig` and the script `lib/scripts/pm2-init-centos.sh`\\n- **gentoo** will use `rc-update` and the script `lib/scripts/pm2`\\n- **systemd** will use `systemctl` and the script `lib/scripts/pm2.service`\\n\\n### User permissions\\n\\nLet\\'s say you want the startup script to be executed under another user.\\n\\nJust use the `-u <username>` option !\\n\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 startup ubuntu -u www\\n`\\n\\n### Related commands\\n\\nDump all processes status and environment managed by PM2:\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 dump\\n`\\nIt populates the file `~/.pm2/dump.pm2` by default.\\n\\nTo bring back the latest dump:\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 resurrect\\n`\\n\\n<a name=\"a890\"/>\\n## Watch & Restart\\n\\nPM2 can automatically restart your app when a file changes in the current directory or its subdirectories:\\n\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 start app.js --watch\\n`\\n\\nIf `--watch` is enabled, stopping it won\\'t stop watching:\\n- `pm2 stop 0` \\'ll not stop watching\\n- `pm2 stop --watch 0` \\'ll stop watching\\n\\nRestart toggle the `watch` parameter when triggered.\\n\\nTo watch specifics paths, please use a JSON app declaration, `watch` can take a string or an array of paths.

But there is no [`reload`](#reloading-without-downtime) or `gracefulReload` command.\\n\\n**By using the fork mode you will lose core features of pm2 like the automatic clusterization of your code over all CPUs available and the 0s reload.**\\n\\nSo use it if you only need a forever-like behaviour.\\n\\nHere is how to start your app within a fork:\\n\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 start app.js -x   # Will start your app.js in fork mode\\n$ pm2 list              # You will see that on the row \"mode\" it\\'s written \"fork\"\\n`\\n\\nYou can also exec scripts written in other languages:\\n\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 start my-bash-script.sh -x --interpreter bash\\n\\n$ pm2 start my-python-script.py -x --interpreter python\\n`\\n\\nThe interpreter is deduced from the file extension from the [following list](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/blob/master/lib/interpreter.json).\\n\\n<a name=\"a96\"/>\\n## JSON app configuration via pipe from stdout\\n\\nPull-requests:\\n- [#273](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/pull/273)\\n- [#279](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/pull/279)\\n\\n`bash\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\nread -d \\'\\' my_json <<_EOF_\\n[{\\n    \"name\"       : \"app1\",\\n    \"script\"     : \"/home/projects/pm2_nodetest/app.js\",\\n    \"instances\"  : \"4\",\\n    \"error_file\" : \"./logz/child-err.log\",\\n    \"out_file\"   : \"./logz/child-out.log\",\\n    \"pid_file\"   : \"./logz/child.pid\",\\n    \"exec_mode\"  : \"cluster_mode\",\\n    \"port\"       : 4200\\n}]\\n_EOF_\\n\\necho $my_json | pm2 start -\\n`\\n\\n<a name=\"a149\"/>\\n## Is my production server ready for PM2?\\n\\nJust try the tests before using PM2 on your production server\\n\\n`bash\\n$ git clone https://github.com/Unitech/pm2.git\\n$ cd pm2\\n$ npm install  # Or do NODE_ENV=development npm install if some packages are missing\\n$ npm test\\n`\\n\\nIf a test is broken please report us issues [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues?state=open)\\nAlso make sure you have all dependencies needed. For Ubuntu:\\n\\n`bash\\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\\n# nvm is a Node.js version manager - https://github.com/creationix/nvm\\n$ wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh\\n$ nvm install v0.11.10\\n$ nvm use v0.11.10\\n$ nvm alias default v0.11.10\\n`\\n\\n<a name=\"a27\"/>\\n## Contributing/Development mode\\n\\nTo hack PM2, it\\'s very simple:\\n\\n`bash\\n$ pm2 kill   # kill the current pm2\\n$ git clone my_pm2_fork.git\\n$ cd pm2/\\n$ DEBUG=* PM2_DEBUG=true ./bin/pm2 --no-daemon\\n`\\n\\nEach time you edit the code, be sure to kill and restart PM2 to make changes taking effect.\\n\\n## Install PM2 development\\n\\n`bash\\n$ npm install git://github.com/Unitech/pm2#development -g\\n`\\n\\n<a name=\"a21\"/>\\n## Known bugs and workarounds\\n\\nFirst, install the lastest PM2 version:\\n\\n`bash\\n$ npm install -g pm2@latest\\n`\\n\\n### Node 0.10.x doesn\\'t free the script port when stopped. It\\'s due to the Node.js cluster module.\\nSo if you feel that this problem is important for your use case, use the [fork mode](#execute-any-script-what-is-fork-mode-) instead.\\nBy using the fork mode you will lose core features of PM2 like the automatic clusterization of your code over all CPUs available and the 0s reload.\\n\\n`\\n$ pm2 start index.js -x  # start my app in fork mode\\n`\\n\\nFor more information about this, see [issue #74](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/74).\\n\\n### `Cannot read property \\'getsockname\\' of undefined`\\n\\nWhen using the cluster mode (by default) you can\\'t use ports from 0 to 1024. If you really need to exec in this range use the [fork mode](#a23) with the `-x` parameter.\\nBy using the fork mode you will lose core features of pm2 like the automatic clusterization of your code over all CPUs available and the 0s reload.\\n\\n### User tips from issues\\n- [Vagrant and pm2 #289](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/289#issuecomment-42900019)\\n- [Start the same app on different ports #322](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/322#issuecomment-46792733)\\n- [Using ansible with pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/88#issuecomment-49106686)\\n- [Cron string as argument](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/496#issuecomment-49323861)\\n- [Restart when process reaches a specific memory amount](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/141)\\n\\n<a name=\"a20\"/>\\n## External resources and articles\\n\\n- [Goodbye node-forever, hello pm2](http://devo.ps/blog/2013/06/26/goodbye-node-forever-hello-pm2.html)\\n- http://www.allaboutghost.com/keep-ghost-running-with-pm2/\\n- http://blog.ponyfoo.com/2013/09/19/deploying-node-apps-to-aws-using-grunt\\n- http://www.allaboutghost.com/keep-ghost-running-with-pm2/\\n- http://bioselemental.com/keeping-ghost-alive-with-pm2/\\n- http://blog.chyld.net/installing-ghost-on-ubuntu-13-10-aws-ec2-instance-with-pm2/\\n- http://blog.marvinroger.fr/gerer-ses-applications-node-en-production-pm2/\\n- https://www.codersgrid.com/2013/06/29/pm2-process-manager-for-node-js/\\n- http://www.z-car.com/blog/programming/how-to-rotate-logs-using-pm2-process-manager-for-node-js\\n- http://yosoftware.com/blog/7-tips-for-a-node-js/\\n- https://www.exponential.io/blog/nodeday-2014-moving-a-large-developer-workforce-to-nodejs\\n- http://blog.rapsli.ch/posts/2013/2013-10-17-node-monitor-pm2.html\\n- https://coderwall.com/p/igdqyw\\n- http://revdancatt.com/2013/09/17/node-day-1-getting-the-server-installing-node-and-pm2/\\n- https://medium.com/tech-talk/e7c0b0e5ce3c\\n\\n## Contributors\\n\\n`\\n   195  tknew2\\n   184  Alexandre Strzelewicz\\n    20  Alex Kocharin\\n     8  soyuka\\n     6  sailxjx\\n     5  Bret Copeland\\n     4  AS\\n     4  Ville Walveranta\\n     4  achingbrain\\n     3  Ben Postlethwaite\\n     3  Evan You\\n     2  Frederico Silva\\n     2  Ivan Seidel\\n     2  MATSUU Takuto\\n     2  Oleg\\n     2  Willian\\n     2  Yani Iliev\\n     1  Almog Melamed\\n     1  Brent Burgoyne\\n     1  Daniel Pihlstrom\\n     1  Ed Hubbell\\n     1  Eugene Lucash\\n     1  Gil Pedersen\\n     1  Hao-kang Den\\n     1  John Hurliman\\n     1  Jose V.

PR Changes\r\n1. Removed the committed node_modules directory and its contents  from the main branch of the repository\r\n2. Added a gitignore file to the repository to help in maintaining repository cleanliness and management ease  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Rational\r\n\r\nHello @ualbertalib,\r\n\r\n[&commat;johnaberlin](https://twitter.com/johnaberlin) on Twitter here. \r\n\r\nAs I was writing the WADL 2017 portion of the JCDL 2017 [trip report](http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/search/label/trip%20report) us at the [Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group](http://oduwsdl.github.io/) (@oduwsdl) do after each conference event attended, \r\nI noticed that your repo had the node_modules from the project's front end committed.\r\n\r\nThe node_modules directory typically does not get committed to the main repository/branch (typically a separate branch) and is considered bad practice \r\nsee (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-best-practices, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11459475/should-i-check-in-node-modules-to-git-when-creating-a-node-js-app-on-heroku, https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/622 and http://web.archive.org/web/20150206044312/http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html).\r\n\r\nThe biggest reason this is not done is due to the large size of this directory and its contents (21,609 file change diff), as well as the size of the repository and commit history.\r\nEach time a contributor to the project adds or updates a dependency to the package.json that dependency and its own dependencies will be added to the repo increasing repo size.\r\nAnd that this project will be added to the @iipc [awesome-web-archiving](https://github.com/iipc/awesome-web-archiving) list here on GitHub soon https://twitter.com/anjacks0n/status/877998711183360000\r\n\r\nHopefully, when the project gets added to the awesome list additional contributors will come a calling. Thus not having the front ends node_modules directory committed will make reviewing their contributions easier as well make internal development smoother especially when cloning for the first time and branch management.  \r\n\r\nIf you are wondering about my credentials and knowledge about node.js development I have two of my own node.js projects featured on [awesome-web-archiving](https://github.com/iipc/awesome-web-archiving): [node-warc](https://github.com/N0taN3rd/node-warc) and [WAIL](https://github.com/n0tan3rd/wail) (Poster at JCDL)\r\n\r\nAwesome project! Excited to see what the future holds for it :+1: !\r\n
