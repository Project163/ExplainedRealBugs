I tried the same behavior in the CLI, the -f or --force argument will behave weirdly. it wont start more than one process at a time. \n...\n#### Steps to reproduce\n\nI did this in the repl having 2 online processes\n\n```\n> var pm2 = require('pm2');\npm2.stop(0)//0 uses modem.js \n//this call has a different name than the one that is stopped\npm2.start('modem.js', {name:'anothername'',force:true,scriptArgs:'xxx yyy' )\n```\n\nit wont load another instance of the process with the name, it will delete de previous process and create one with the name 'anothername' the behavior I need is that it creates another process with another name\n#### Software versions used\n\n```\nOS         :ubuntu 16.04\nnode.js    :v5\nPM2        :I have used several, even next, same behaviour\n```\n#### PM2 Log output\n\nUse the command: `tail --lines 50 ~/.pm2/pm2.log`\n\n```\n2016-08-16 14:32:22: Script /home/herrkin/dev/work/smsinterface/modem.js had too many unstable restarts (16).
