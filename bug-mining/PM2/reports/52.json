Why we have to use babel-node under iojs? It's not a dependency of babel.\n2. When PM2 start a script, it forks a worker but find the source of the soft link, here is a e.g.:\n  I have start a script like this(under iojs):\n\n``` bash\n  pm2 start app.js --next-gen-js\n```\n\n  I will get two process:\n\n``` bash\n  node /path/to/babe-node/cli app.js\n  /path/to/iojs/cli /path/to/node_modules/babel-node/lib/_babel-node app.js\n```\n\n  In this case, when the process restart, the 'port in use' error alway throw.\n","closed_by":{"login":"soyuka","id":1321971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka","html_url":"https://github.com/soyuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1444/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
