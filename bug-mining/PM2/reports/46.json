Is there a way to run pm2 with `--no-daemon` flag and without log streaming? I log into one file with `--merge-logs` flag so it is unnecessary for me to log to `stdout` concurrently. \n2. Is there a way to split log output from application and from pm2 into separated log files?\n3. I am encountering strange error while runnnig app. My application is running in docker container, and this container periodically dies because of this PM2 error:\n\n```\n14:18:04 PM2 -softReload- Old worker disconnected\n14:18:04 PM2 Stopping app:user-fe-api id:_old_15\n14:18:04 PM2 190 pid can not be killed { [Error: kill ESRCH] code: 'ESRCH', errno: 'ESRCH', syscall: 'kill' }\n```\n\nIs there any advice what to do with this error?\n\nI am running on `iojs-2.3.3` and `pm2-0.14.3`.\n\nThanks for your reply.\n\nO.\n","closed_by":{"login":"zdychacek","id":2000174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDAxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2000174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek","html_url":"https://github.com/zdychacek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
