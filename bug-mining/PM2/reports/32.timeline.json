can now change chokidar options through the `watch_options` variable in the schema.\n\n@caseywebdev wrote:\n\n> I ran into this issue in my own project using chokidar w/ vagrant/parallels/boot2docker. The problem is that the atomic file watching option is being defaulted to when, over NFS, your only option is file polling as inotify events will not be triggered. My solution was to add a command line option to opt into usePolling and now everything is working again.\n\nSo, you can change the `atomic` parameter to `true` or `false` or change the `usePolling` parameter to fit your needs. \nIf I understood this issue, it wasn't really pm2-related more chokidar-related. Try playing with those parameters and if you can't fix it please come back to us!\n\n/edit: \n\nI've added some docs about the chokidar use: https://github.com/Unitech/PM2/blob/master/ADVANCED_README.md#watch--restart. \n\nPM2 is giving those default options to chokidar:\n\n```\nvar watch_options = {\n  persistent    : true,\n  ignoreInitial : true\n}\n```\n\nOther options are the one defined by chokidar, for example `usePolling` is `false`.\n\n/edit 2: while using NFS use `usePolling: true`  see
