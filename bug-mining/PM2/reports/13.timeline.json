Alex:\n\n`pm2 restart path|scriptname` command exists for a long time, recently I found some issues with this command, for example:\n\nI have a node service (and others) named 'striker' on my server, the startup script is something like '/usr/local/repos/striker/bin/striker', and I deployed two version of this script, which one is 'release' versions and another is 'general availability' version. \n\nWhen I start these two service with pm2, it works well.\n\n```\n┌────────────┬────┬─────────┬──────┬────────┬──────┬───────────┬────────┬───────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ App Name   │ id │ mode    │ PID  │ status │ port

'God/Methods.findByName' function. I wonder how many people will use `restart` command with path or script name. So I removed `find by path/script name` in `findByName` function, just keep it **simple** and **clear**. What's your opinion?\n\nCheers!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/comments/48171076","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/558#issuecomment-48171076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/558","id":48171076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTcxMDc2","user":{"login":"soyuka","id":1321971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka","html_url":"https://github.com/soyuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-07T12:18:10Z","updated_at":"2014-07-07T12:18:10Z","body":"Quoting for ease: \nhttps://github.com/Unitech/pm2/blob/master/lib/God/Methods.js#L82\n\nI agree that it should only test the \"name\" not the path basename.
