out the following questions:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What's going wrong?**\r\nUsing application declartion trying to have a \"cron\" job kind of task running every \"X\" minutes, if the app that need to run have \"process.exit()\" command the status column on \"pm2 list\" returns \"stopped\" and sometimes \"errored\".\r\n\r\n**How could we reproduce this issue?**\r\nusing a .config.js file and simple js script file with these:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  /**\r\n   * Application configuration section\r\n   * http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/\r\n   */\r\n  apps : [\r\n    // First application\r\n    {\r\n      name      : \"cron_simpleConsole\",\r\n      script    : \"/home/pm2schedule_test.js\",\r\n      args: \"myargs\",\r\n      cron_restart: \"*/1 * * * *\",\r\n      autorestart: false,\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe simple js file\r\n```js\r\nvar env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';\r\nvar arg = process.argv[2];\r\nconsole.log('I was executed! - ',env,'-',arg,'-', Date().toLocaleString());\r\nprocess.exit();\r\n```\r\nNote: **this is just example code of using process.exit(), it is not the code i use but it has the same result i am trying to fix/understand**\r\n\r\nrunning this config with pm2 will cause it to run once and be stopped/errored and never run again.\r\nI know some will say \"process.exit()\" should not be called but sometimes i have no choice or else it big code refactoring which is not what i am after.\r\n\r\nIs this how it is suppose to be? thanks!\r\n## Supporting information\r\n\r\n```\r\nPM2 version:
