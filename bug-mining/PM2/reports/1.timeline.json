What's going wrong?\r\n\r\nWhen performing a graceful exit on Windows, any use of console messaging kills the process.\r\n\r\n## How could we reproduce this issue?\r\n\r\n1. Use `shutdown_with_message` to create a test job\r\n2. In the test job, on receiving the process.on('message') with the 'shutdown' message, log to console\r\n3. Add a second console statement after the first message from step #2\r\n4. Run the job in PM2\r\n5. You won't see the second console statement in step #3 because the process exits\r\n\r\n## Supporting information\r\n\r\nI suspect there is a possible conflict with logging.  In other words, PM2 still wants to perform some stream redirection but the log streams are shut down.  I'm not sure, but I know the PM2 logs themselves only indicate a zero-exit-code process termination on SIGINT.  I'm not able to intercept SIGINT so my guess is this occurring somewhere else within PM2's code.\r\n\r\nIt's an odd bug but took me at least an hour of debugging.\r\n\r\n``````\r\n--- PM2 report

What's going wrong?\r\n\r\nMy pm2 config file has 2 interpreter_args in the string. The second option does not appear to be parsed or enabled.\r\n\r\nArg #1 : --no-experimental-fetch\r\nArg #2 : --trace-warnings\r\n\r\n## How could we reproduce this issue?\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  name              : \"[REDACTED]\",\r\n  args              : \"\",\r\n  cwd               : \"[REDACTED]\",\r\n  env               : {\r\n      NODE_ENV      : \"development\",\r\n  },\r\n  interpreter_args  : \"--no-experimental-fetch --trace-warnings\",\r\n  script            : \"[REDACTED].js\",\r\n  watch             : false\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Supporting information\r\n\r\nWhen I use `pm2 monit` I only see Arg #1 enabled. [See below]\r\n```\r\nApp Name              [REDACTED]\r\nNamespace             default\r\nVersion               0.4.0\r\nRestarts              351\r\nUptime                37m\r\nScript path           [REDACTED]/[REDACTED].js\r\nScript args           --[REDACTED] --[REDACTED] --[REDACTED]\r\nInterpreter           node\r\nInterpreter args      --no-experimental-fetch\r\nExec mode             fork\r\nNode.js version       18.17.1\r\n```\r\nYou can see [above] that only the first argument is displayed. But there are 3 script arguments that are all passed.\r\n\r\nIn testing this app, I got the following log message from the app:\r\n\r\n`6|[REDACTED]      | (Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)`\r\n\r\nThis is what lead me to see via `pm2 monit` that the second node interpreter arg was not being passed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Run the following commands\r\n$ pm2
