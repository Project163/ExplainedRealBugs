parseInt(process.env.PM2_API_PORT)  || 9615,\n</code>\n\nThat means that if I want to set the web interface port I should simply define $PM2_API_PORT variable, otherwise the system takes the default 9615 value.\n\nIf it's possible to make the same with pm2.log and pm2.pid files:\n\n<code>\nPM2_LOG_FILE_PATH  : p.join(process.env.PM2_LOG_DIR || p.resolve(process.env.HOME, '.pm2'),
