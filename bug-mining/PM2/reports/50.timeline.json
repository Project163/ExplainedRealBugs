I'm relying on pm2 for most of my log handling needs, and it'd be swell\nif log rotation and archiving also \"just worked\" by default. That\npm2-logrotate project isn't a production-quality solution IMO. Basically it\njust does a synchronous read, write, truncate, which I'd expect would lead\nto data loss. The real-deal logrotate does some pretty fancy stuff to make\nsure the cutover is seamless. Perhaps the feature here could be a command\nthat installs an OS-appropriate logrotate configuration, similar to \"pm2\nstartup\" but \"pm2 logrotate\". Of course nothing prevents anyone from doing\nthis themselves. It'd just be slick to have it integrated into pm2 since it\nalready does so much stuff around logs.\n\nOn Sun, Jul 5, 2015 at 7:40 AM Antoine Bluchet notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> What keeps you of adding a logrotate yourself?
