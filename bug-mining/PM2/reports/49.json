Unfortunately on our production machine it crashes at least once a day.\n\nkern.log:\n`Jun 22 15:06:02 Ubuntu-1404-trusty-64-minimal kernel: [569531.959543] PM2 v0.14.1: Go[19539]: segfault at 3fffffffa0 ip 0000000000902e38 sp 00007fff99f29290 error 4 in nodejs[400000+b60000]`\n\nWe tried to add upstart to call `pm2 resurrect` in case pm2 dies, but apparently that doesn't work too. Couldn't really check that one though.\n\nWe have node v0.12.4. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing the same issue? It's really a shame, I loved keymetrics interface, but I can't use it without pm2 on the server.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jorge-d","id":1178099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1178099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d","html_url":"https://github.com/jorge-d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jorge-d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
