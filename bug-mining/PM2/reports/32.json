This shared folder is exposed as a docker volume.\n- Launches several docker containers, one of which runs PM2 to launch a Node.JS script. PM2 watches a sub-directory of the above docker volume.\n\nIn version 0.12.1 of PM2, I could edit a watched file on my Mac OS X host and PM2 would correctly restart the application. In (at least) 0.12.3 of PM2, this is no longer the case. If I SSH into the Virtualbox and touch the same file there, PM2 restarts the application.\n\nI've debugged this for a couple of days and tried many different Vagrant/Virtualbox/Docker configurations thinking the issue lay there. But on a whim I tried installing an older version of PM2 that had been working in a similar project, and things started to work. I noticed that there were some file watching changes in 0.12.2. Perhaps some of these changes are causing this behaviour?\n","closed_by":{"login":"soyuka","id":1321971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka","html_url":"https://github.com/soyuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
