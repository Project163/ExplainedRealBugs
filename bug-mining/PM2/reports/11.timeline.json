is an attempt to address part of https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/268 - if you run pm2 as root, everything it starts also runs as root.\n\nIt adds two options to the command line `--run-as-user` and `--run-as-group`.\n\nIf you are running `pm2` as root, and you start a process like this:\n\n```\n# pm2 --run-as-user foo start test.js\n```\n\n..then pm2 will fork the current process (as `root`), set up the child's logs and pid file (as `root`, in /root/.pm2), then switch to user `foo` to require and run `test.js`.  Because the logs were opened before the privilege drop the process can still write to them even though the new user doesn't have the permissions to do so.\n\nIf you then do `ps aux | grep pm2` you'll see something like:\n\n```\nroot            31568   0.0  0.0  2432784    476 s009  R+    7:30PM   0:00.00 grep pm2\nfoo             31564   0.0  0.1  3057912  23156   ??

Ss    7:30PM   0:00.12 pm2: Satan Daemonizer \n```\n\n..which shows that `pm2` is still running as `root` whereas the managed process `test.js` is running as `foo`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":137662163,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM3NjYyMTYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/events/137662163","actor":{"login":"soyuka","id":1321971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka","html_url":"https://github.com/soyuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0a934f506a655b4ded1b43c913d5b573ec2de9f1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/commits/0a934f506a655b4ded1b43c913d5b573ec2de9f1","created_at":"2014-07-02T22:51:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":137662164,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEzNzY2MjE2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/events/137662164","actor":{"login":"Unitech","id":757747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Nzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/757747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fcf6d9f2c8d3b2327cd0b3e1a02f8a1d68489500","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/commits/fcf6d9f2c8d3b2327cd0b3e1a02f8a1d68489500","created_at":"2014-07-02T22:51:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
