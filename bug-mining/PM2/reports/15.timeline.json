is a weird one. Hopefully I can explain clearly. Let's say that I run `pm2 start a.js -- 3000` and _a.js_ calls `require('child_process').exec('pm2 start b.js -- 4000')` then _b.js_ will receive 3000 as it's argument instead of 4000, as expected. This is true even if _a.js_ uses the API, e.g. `pm2.start('b.js', {rawArgs: ['--', 4000]})`. The child process seems to inherit the command line arguments of the parent.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/941/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
