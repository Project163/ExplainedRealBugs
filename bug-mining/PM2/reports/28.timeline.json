Vagrant (1.7.2) with Virtualbox (4.3.20) on Mac OS X 10.10.1 and a Vagrant configuration which does the following:\n- Uses Vagrant's build-in docker support to provision a virtual machine that mounts a NFS shared folder. This shared folder is exposed as a docker volume.\n- Launches several docker containers, one of which runs PM2 to launch a Node.JS script. PM2 watches a sub-directory of the above docker volume.\n\nIn version 0.12.1 of PM2, I could edit a watched file on my Mac OS X host and PM2 would correctly restart the application. In (at least) 0.12.3 of PM2, this is no longer the case. If I SSH into the Virtualbox and touch the same file there, PM2 restarts the application.\n\nI've debugged this for a couple of days and tried many different Vagrant/Virtualbox/Docker configurations thinking the issue lay there. But on a whim I tried installing an older version of PM2 that had been working in a similar project, and things started to work. I noticed that there were some file watching changes in 0.12.2. Perhaps some of these changes are causing this

deployment process releases a new version of the code into a versioned folder e.g. wwwapi_v1.0.60. We then create / update a symbolic link wwwapi that points to the version folder.We start the application from symbolic link wwwapi using the following json file:\n[{\n  \"name\"             : \"s008.wwwapi\",\n  \"args\"             : \"['port=10800', 'host=0.0.0.0', 'platformKey=s008']\",\n  \"script\"           : \"app.js\",\n  \"cwd\"              : \"/var/www/s008/xxx.yyy.com/wwwapi\",\n  \"log_date_format\"  : \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z\",\n  \"error_file\"       : \"/var/log/www/s008/xxx.yyy.com/wwwapi/stderr.log\",\n  \"out_file\"         : \"/var/log/www/s008/xxx.yyy.com/wwwapi/stdout.log\",\n  \"min_uptime\"       : \"1000s\",\n  \"max_restarts\"     : 15,\n  \"watch\"            : true,\n  \"ignoreWatch\"      : [\"[\\/\\\\]\\./\", \"node_modules\" ],\n  \"merge_logs\"       : true,\n  \"exec_interpreter\" : \"node\",\n  \"exec_mode\"        : \"fork\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"NODE_ENV\": \"s008\"\n  }\n}]\n\nWhen we switch the symbolic link it fails to auto restart the application. This worked on version 12.4 (node v0.10.30 and Centos 6.5) but upgrading to version 12.14  (node v0.10.30 and Centos 6.5) has broken the auto restart process. \n\nTouching a file inside the symbolic directory caused the restart process if the symbolic link hasn't been updated. If the symbolic link updates, touching a file won't cause the restart.\n\nIs there a new flag to make it work this way, or is this an issue that needs fixing?\n\nThanks\n\nCraig\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"snyk-bot","id":19733683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzMzNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19733683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/snyk-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T16:36:43Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T16:36:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allcky/pm2/issues/7","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allcky/pm2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allcky/pm2/issues/7/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allcky/pm2/issues/7/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/allcky/pm2/issues/7/events","html_url":"https://github.com/allcky/pm2/pull/7","id":1100552058,"node_id":"PR_kwDOByG-FM4w3mLG","number":7,"title":"[Snyk]
