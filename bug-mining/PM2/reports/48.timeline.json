Last try I then did `pm2 show index` (index.js) and got a result, but a 2nd try moments later of `pm2 show index` and Here's what I got:\n\n```\n[PM2] Spawning PM2 daemon\n[PM2] PM2 Successfully daemonized\n[PM2][WARN] index doesn't exist\n```\n\nI see an instance of Node.exe running still so I'm guessing that PM2 is still running, but without even accessing my app (so I know I didn't crash it) which runs fine on its own and with forever, I'm guessing that its thread is no longer there.\n\nI also tried setting PM2_HOME and when I start my app, I get a conf.js and module_conf.json file in that folder. I then tried `pm2 start index.js` again and it wouldn't even start. I then killed that node.exe instance I saw and tried again. This time I got a logs and pids folder and pm2.og and pm2.pid files in that folder, but when I tried `pm2 list` it seemed to hang up and when I tried `pm2 show index` I got the same result as above.\n\nNow that I have a log file, I'm seeing what's going on:\n\n`TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined node_modules\\pm2\\node_modules\\pidusage\\lib\\stats.js:136:26` stdout is undefined which makes sense since on stats.js:135, stdout is an empty string.\n\nIf I put a check in place there and setup the stats object to have null values for the 3 children and try again, then I get an error at 152 raised by async `Error: Callback was already called.`\n\nWas this tested on Windows?
