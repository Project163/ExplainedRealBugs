I'm using pm2 with babel-node interpreter and I find it impossible to kill the app once it has started. I first noticed that reloading after code changes didn't work and logs showed \n\n```\nPM2 Change detected for app name: insights-dev - restarting\nPM2 Stopping app:insights-dev id:0\nPM2 App name:insights-dev id:0 exited with code SIGTERM\nPM2 Process with pid 17912 killed\nPM2 Starting execution sequence in -fork mode- for app name:insights-dev id:0\nPM2 App name:insights-dev id:0 online\ninsights-dev-0 Port 3000 is already in use\n```\n\nin repeat.\n\nAfter checking `pm2 ls`, I see this:\n\n```\n┌──────────────┬────┬──────┬───────┬────────┬─────────┬────────┬─────────────┬──────────┐\n│ App name     │ id │ mode │ pid   │ status │ restart │ uptime │ memory      │ watching │\n├──────────────┼────┼──────┼───────┼────────┼─────────┼────────┼─────────────┼──────────┤\n│ insights-dev │ 0  │ fork │ 18495 │ online │ 26      │ 2s     │ 18.605 MB   │  enabled │\n└──────────────┴────┴──────┴───────┴────────┴─────────┴────────┴─────────────┴──────────┘\n```\n\nand the restart number keeps going up.\n\nEven if I run `pm2 delete all` and `pm2 kill`, if I then try to restart the app, I'll have the same problem and I can see the process running with `ps aux | grep babel-node'\n\n```\n17938   0.0  1.1  3179668 180928   ??

I've tried with pm2 installed locally, globally, both and the same for babel.\n\nAny ideas? What more info could I provide to help you identify the problem?\n\nEdit:\n\nTo clarify, I'm running pm2 from a dev.json file, with only options being: \n\n```\n\"autorestart\": true,\n\"exec_interpreter\": \"babel-node\",\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1559/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
