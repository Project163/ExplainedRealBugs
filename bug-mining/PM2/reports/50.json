My server's storage was full because of my application's PM2 log file -which was 25GB in size :fearful: As a result, the application stopped working. I think this is something serious that should be considered when setting up default behavior with collecting log files.\n\nI guess integration with logrotate can be an option. Just like nginx. As you probably know, nginx -by default- uses logrotate to compress and remove old log files. IMHO PM2 should have something similar which would prevent edge cases like I experienced. \n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"soyuka","id":1321971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka","html_url":"https://github.com/soyuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
