I need to log these messages coming from PM2 too. So redirect to `/dev/null` is not a solution for me :(\n\nActually, my second question is related to the following. I would like to have an option to separate log outputs coming from PM2 and from my application. I mean, one log file with all messages prefixed with `PM2` (those coming from PM2) and second log file with application specific logs. Can I separate logs somehow in this way?\n\nAd 3) Unfortunately this error is appearing periodically all the time :( Before I've updated pm2 from version 0.14.1 to 0.14.3 I had a problem with the following error: `FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - process out of memory`. Today I've done update to v0.14.3 and new error started to appear: `{ [Error: kill ESRCH] code: 'ESRCH', errno: 'ESRCH', syscall: 'kill' }` \n\nI am attaching json configuration with which I run the app:\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"admin-fe-api\",\n    \"script\": \"dist/app.js\",\n    \"node_args\": [\n        \"--max_old_space_size=400\",\n        \"--es_staging\",\n        \"--harmony_proxies\"\n    ],\n    \"log_file\": \"/var/....\",\n    \"instances\": 15,\n    \"max_memory_restart\" : \"300M\",\n    \"merge_logs\": true,\n    \"exec_mode\": \"cluster_mode\",\n    \"vizion\": false\n}\n```\n\nI can see from my log, that workers are restarted several times/minute, when the traffic is high.\n\nHere is another death output:\n\n```\n17:09:32 PM2 [PM2][WORKER] Process 13 restarted because it uses 0 memory and has ONLINE status\n17:09:32 PM2 Stopping app:user-fe-api id:13\n17:09:32 PM2 App name:user-fe-api id:13 disconnected\n17:09:32 PM2 170 pid can not be

much for any help.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/comments/119637611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zdychacek","id":2000174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDAxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2000174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek","html_url":"https://github.com/zdychacek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":355574645,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU1NTc0NjQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/events/355574645","actor":{"login":"zdychacek","id":2000174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDAxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2000174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek","html_url":"https://github.com/zdychacek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdychacek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-07-14T17:06:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/comments/123754260","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/1422#issuecomment-123754260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/1422","id":123754260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMzc1NDI2MA==","user":{"login":"Unitech","id":757747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Nzc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/757747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech","html_url":"https://github.com/Unitech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Unitech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-22T15:12:45Z","updated_at":"2015-07-22T15:12:45Z","body":"Refixed
