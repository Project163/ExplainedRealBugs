Thank you for the PM2 project, it's great!\nI've got a question about pm2.log and pm2.pid files. As far as I know these files are always located in ~/.pm2/ directory and there is now way to change it via configuration.\nIs it possible to add customization for the location of these files?\nIt would be great to have separate path settings for pm2.log and pm2.pid respectively.\n\nFor example:\n\n/var/log/my_project/pm2.log\n/var/run/my_project/pm2.pid\n\nThank you!\n","closed_by":{"login":"soyuka","id":1321971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka","html_url":"https://github.com/soyuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soyuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/438/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Unitech/pm2/issues/438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
