Even running the `kill <pid>` command, the process still exists and, as you said, is back on the pm2 list. \n\nI think the issue might be related to the option `--watch` +  `pm2 restart`, and this seems to be a known bug in issue https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/494. My solution is: running `pm2 kill`, maybe not good enough, but  the zombie processes finally be
