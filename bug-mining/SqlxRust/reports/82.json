Bug Description\r\n\r\n``PgConnection::connect()`` executed with no password gives 'Failed to open `.pgpass` file', while this is a completely normal use case, so it should cause no warnings.\r\n\r\nThis seems some recent regression, as my code was not showing the warnings before switching to ``sqlx 0.8``.\r\n\r\nConnecting to a local database with no password is perfectly normal and can be perfectly safe (PostgreSQL 'ident' authentication uses local system user account security).\r\n\r\nThis is similar to #3466, but covers even more basic use case, when no ``PgConnectOptions`` are used.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() {\r\n    env_logger::builder()\r\n        .filter(None, log::LevelFilter::Info)\r\n        .init();\r\n    use sqlx::Connection;\r\n    sqlx::postgres::PgConnection::connect(\"postgres:///test\")\r\n        .await\r\n        .unwrap();\r\n    println!(\"connected!\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code output:\r\n```text\r\n$ target/debug/sqlxtest\r\n[2024-09-30T08:36:30Z WARN  sqlx_postgres::options::pgpass] Failed to open `.pgpass` file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" } path=/home/jajcus/.pgpass\r\nconnected!\r\n```\r\n\r\n``psql`` does not complain in this case:\r\n```text\r\n$ psql test\r\npsql (16.4 (Ubuntu 16.4-0ubuntu0.24.04.2))\r\nType \"help\" for help.\r\n\r\ntest=# \\q\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Info\r\n* SQLx version: 0.8.2\r\n* SQLx features enabled: \"runtime-tokio\", \"tls-native-tls\", \"postgres\"\r\n* Database server and version: PostgreSQL 16.4\r\n* Operating system: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS Linux\r\n* `rustc --version`: rustc 1.80.0 (051478957
