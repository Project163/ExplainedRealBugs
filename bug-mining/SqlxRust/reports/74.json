Bug Description\r\nafter upgrading to `0.7.0` I'm getting this error when using https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/trait.Type.html#transparent\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `Vec<i64>: PgHasArrayType` is not satisfied\r\n --> src/lib.rs:1:10\r\n  |\r\n1 | #[derive(sqlx::Type)]\r\n  |          ^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `PgHasArrayType` is not implemented for `Vec<i64>`\r\n  |\r\n  = help: the trait `PgHasArrayType` is implemented for `Vec<u8>`\r\n  = help: see issue #48214\r\n  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `sqlx::Type` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\r\n\r\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.\r\nerror: could not compile `sqlx-test2` (lib) due to previous error\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n```console\r\ncargo init --lib sqlx-test\r\n```\r\n`src/lib.rs`:\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(sqlx::Type)]\r\n#[sqlx(transparent)]\r\npub struct ScriptHashes(pub Vec<i64>);\r\n```\r\n`Cargo.toml`:\r\n```rust\r\n[package]\r\nname = \"sqlx-test2\"\r\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\r\nedition = \"2021\"\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\nsqlx = { version = \"0.7.0\", features = [\r\n    \"macros\",\r\n    \"postgres\",\r\n] }\r\n```\r\nthen\r\n```console\r\ncargo build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Info\r\n* SQLx version: 0.7.0\r\n* SQLx features enabled: `macros` and `postgres`\r\n* Database server and version: Postgres 14 or 15\r\n* Operating system: linux\r\n* `rustc --version`: rustc 1.70.0 (90c541806 2023-05-31)\r\n\r\n### additional info\r\n* issue doesn't occur with version `0.6.3`\r\n* I think that this might be related
