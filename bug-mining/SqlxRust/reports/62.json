I can only query this api `DB_MAXCONN`(defined in .env) times, after that sqlx will get stuck at `pool.begin`, even `/nostuck` will get stuck too. `/test` shows that actix_web is working well.  \r\nI don't know what's wrong with `/stuck`, it seems that in this api the connection isn't returned to the pool. What I'm trying to do in this api is I want to do something background without blocking the response, `jh.join` on line 130 is only there to demonstrate the problem, I won't join the thread in actual code.","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
