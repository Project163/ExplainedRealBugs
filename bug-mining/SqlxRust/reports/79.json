This leads to silent overflows/invalid decoding.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n[I've implemented a minimal reproduction here.](https://github.com/elsirion/sqlx-repro/blob/master/src/main.rs) The relevant part:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet db = AnyPool::connect(\"sqlite::memory:\").await?;\r\nlet mut connection = db.acquire().await?;\r\n\r\n// 4294967297 = 2^32\r\nlet number = query_as::<_, (i64,)>(\"SELECT 4294967296\")\r\n    .fetch_one(connection.as_mut())\r\n    .await?\r\n    .0;\r\n\r\nassert_eq!(number, 4294967296);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis panics with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nassertion `left == right` failed\r\n  left: 0\r\n right: 4294967296\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Info\r\n* SQLx version: `0.7.4`\r\n* SQLx features enabled: `\"runtime-tokio\", \"any\", \"sqlite\"`\r\n* Database server and version: SQLite (`libsqlite3-sys v0.27.0`)\r\n* Operating system: NixOS/Linux\r\n* `rustc --version`: `rustc 1.76.0 (07dca489a 2024-02-04)`\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nFor anyone looking for a workaround: just cast the integer to `TEXT` in SQL and then parse it on the rust side. I'm currently doing this in one of my weekend hack projects: https://github.com/elsirion/fedimint-observer/blob/181aa61e3be51993bd531d9b072375f2f0113618/src/federation/mod.rs#L626-L651","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
