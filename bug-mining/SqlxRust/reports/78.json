Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen the elapsed time for a query goes over some amount, there is a log for a warn. The message then only contained the query itself and again in another field a truncated version of the query. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA clear \"query took too long\"  in one of those fields would help convey what might seem like a random warn. The time was already a problem, but was known, and time was spent trying to figure out if there was another issue at play.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nAs its the library itself that has the logging, there is nothing I can do as long query times are not an error that can be matched on. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nversion 0.7.1\r\npostgres 15\r\n\r\nLooks like this is the line where the logic for the log happens:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/7e7dded8afd93fd74d6d6f65cd9187fea78b4d0f/sqlx-core/src/logger.rs#L86-L93\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/2669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/2669/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
