Basically, if I have an endpoint `password`, the various routing macros will create a struct with name `password`. In Rust, a structure name cannot be used as an identifier for a variable, which is exactly what happens when using the `query!` macro with for example 'password' as a parameter. I don't exactly know how the macro works, so I sadly cannot give any suggestions on how to fix this.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the error I am getting when compiling:\r\n```rust\r\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\r\n  --> backend/src/auth.rs:11:8\r\n   |\r\n11 |       if sqlx::query!(\r\n   |  ________^\r\n12 | |         r#\"\r\n13 | |         SELECT * FROM users WHERE\r\n14 | |             uname = $1 AND  \r\n15 | |            password = $2;\r\n16 | |    \"#,\r\n17 | |        &payload.identifier,\r\n18 | |         &payload.password,\r\n19 | |     )\r\n   | |     ^\r\n   | |     |\r\n   | |     expected struct `String`, found struct `password`\r\n   | |     this expression has type `String`\r\n   | |_____`password` is interpreted as a unit struct, not a new binding\r\n   |       help: introduce a new binding instead: `other_password`\r\n...\r\n63 |   #[post(\"/password\")]\r\n   |   -------------------- unit struct defined here\r\n   |\r\n   = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\r\n\r\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\r\n  --> backend/src/auth.rs:11:8\r\n   |\r\n11 |       if sqlx::query!(\r\n   |  ________^\r\n12 | |         r#\"\r\n13 | |         SELECT * FROM users WHERE\r\n14 | |             uname = $1 AND  \r\n15 | |            password = $2;\r\n16 | |    \"#,\r\n17 | |        &payload.identifier,\r\n18 | |         &payload.password,\r\n19 | |     )\r\n   | |_____^ expected struct `String`, found struct `password`\r\n```\r\nI'm not looking for a workaround, just thought I'd let you know this was an issue.","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1322/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
