by @hsivonen to put resolution options at the top for folks who come here:\r\n\r\n__To resolve this compilation error, update SQLx to 0.8.3 and/or update Rust to 1.81 or later.__\r\n\r\nThis compilation error is due to a combination of:\r\n1. SQLx unnecessarily turning off the default features of `url`, and from a proc macro context specifically. (Request for SQLx not to do that: https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3589)\r\n2. `url` 2.5.3 (and `idna` 1.0.3) conditionally raising MSRV to 1.81 when default features are off (from #831). Conditionally raising MSRV to 1.81 is not a semver break, because raising MSRV isn't a semver break.\r\n3. `resolver = \"2\"`, which is implied by `edition = \"2021\"` performing feature resolution for proc macro dependencies separately from normal dependencies, so a normal dependency on `url` with default features enabled does not cause default features to be enabled for the proc macro case.\r\n\r\nOriginal report follows:\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Note that this crate implements the [URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) not RFC 1738 or RFC 3986\r\n\r\n**Describe the

問題\r\n\r\n20241207現在、この sqlx-core の内部依存の変更を受け、書籍の手順を  1.78.0 で動かすことは出来ません。\r\n\r\nsqlx-core -> url -> idna が 1.81.0 以降を要求します。\r\n\r\n## 再現方法\r\n\r\nrust-toolchain.toml で 1.78.0 を指定したまま、Cargo.lock を削除して cargo build し直すと、ビルドに失敗します。\r\n\r\n```\r\n# git clone <repo>\r\n$ git switch chapter3\r\n$ rm -r Cargo.toml target\r\n$ cargo build\r\n....\r\nerror[E0658]: use of unstable library feature

だけ無視したのでこの状態になりました。\r\n\r\n\r\n## 問題の発生理由\r\n\r\nsqlx-core が依存する url crate は \"version\"=\"^2.2.2\" が指定されており、今の状態で更新すると 2.5.2  から 2.5.4  に上がります。その推移的依存関係の idna が 0.5.0 -> 1.0.7 に更新され、これは 1.81 以降でしかビルドできません。\r\n\r\n## 対応案\r\n\r\nこの本の手順を再現するために 1.78.0 を指定すると、Cargo.lock を移植しない限り、逆に動かない状態になります。\r\n\r\n1.78.0 のままで動かすワークアラウンドとして、このリポジトリのCargo.lock をコピーすると問題を回避できるのは確認できています。 \r\n\r\nじゃあ 1.81.0 にあげるとそのまま解決するかと言うと、次の use が追加で必要になりました。\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nuse axum::extract::State;\r\n```\r\n\r\nこれは `async fn health_check_db(State(db): State<PgPool>) -> StatusCode {` でパターンマッチするための State の参照の解決ですが、マクロ解決か何かの影響を受けて書籍のコードは動きません。\r\n\r\nなので、いずれにせよ何らかの対応をしないとこのリポジトリを動かすことができません。\r\n\r\n- 1.78.0 で Cargo.lock を移植する\r\n- 1.81.0  に `use axum::extract::State;` を追加する\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-web-app-book/rusty-book-manager/issues/9/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-web-app-book/rusty-book-manager/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16000944611,"node_id":"UE_lADODb6dM86c-oLHzwAAAAO5uwnj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/events/16000944611","actor":{"login":"eiswind","id":1238044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzgwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1238044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind","html_url":"https://github.com/eiswind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eiswind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unsubscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-20T15:45:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16023349578,"node_id":"SE_lADODb6dM86c-oLHzwAAAAO7EOlK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/events/16023349578","actor":{"login":"Dante-Broggi","id":34220985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjIwOTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34220985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi","html_url":"https://github.com/Dante-Broggi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dante-Broggi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-22T04:50:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
