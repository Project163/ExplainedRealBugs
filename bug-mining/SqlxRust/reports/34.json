Unfortunately this regresses localized databases (e.g. lc_messages = fr_FR.UTF8) for versions >= 9.6, because the `S` field is also localized and thus an \"unknown severity\" error is generated.\r\n\r\nA potential fix could be to parse the two fields separately (say `severity_v: Option<PgSeverity>` and `severity_s: Option<PgSeverity>`) and then doing a `severity_v.or(severity_s).unwrap_or(PgSeverity::Log)`. If this sounds like the right approach I can come up with a patch.","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
