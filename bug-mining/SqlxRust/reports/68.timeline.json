I was able to reproduce this with a specific Vitess version and we're going to look into it. This issue can be closed. :-)\r\n\r\nMore details here from the PlanetScale side. The issue here is more nuanced than \"this is a regression\" because this breaking is something we actually consider a bug fix. The change was made specifically here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/10163/files#diff-9d2575386e98a47276e4d5c75e73cdefec7078a95ea4e159b50806a8c3099c1bR101\r\n\r\nVitess has the notion of certain SQL mode flags that are unsupported to be changed by the end user. `PIPES_AS_CONCAT` is included in that set of flags, but before that fix we didn't properly validate and error when clients end up setting unsupported flags. \r\n\r\nBefore this fix, what this can result in, is wrong results being returned. Vitess itself also parses the SQL queries and for example in the case of sharded setups has to aggregate and combine results from different MySQL instances. This means that we also have an SQL evaluation engine in Vitess.\r\n\r\nThat parser and evaluation engine only deal with the standard MySQL dialect. Options like `PIPES_AS_CONCAT` or `ANSI_QUOTES` change the actual parsing of SQL queries which is not something Vitess supports. This means that before when we didn't explicitly error on this, you would get silently potentially wrong results returned whenever an `||` was used in a query (depending on details like sharding and other factors of where this query was evaluated, in Vitess, MySQL or in both). \r\n\r\nIn order the avoid this silent broken behavior, what we needed to do was explicitly blocking these changes since we don't have any current plans to support modes like `ANSI_QUOTES` or `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`. \r\n\r\nIs it possible that `sqlx` is willing to consider not setting / needing `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`? And instead for example use the `CONCAT()` function when two strings need to be concatenated?
