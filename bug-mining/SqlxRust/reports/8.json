It supports the PostgreSQL protocol, but [it apparently requires](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/show-vars.html) IntervalStyle to be set to `postgres` instead of `iso_8601`.\r\n\r\nSQLx sets it to the latter here:\r\nhttps://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/d2695068995e3e530854b8a2f52da23c3aa7b588/sqlx-core/src/postgres/connection.rs#L108\r\nWhich results in:\r\n```\r\nError: invalid value for parameter \"IntervalStyle\": \"iso_8601\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs supporting `postgres` here easy for SQLx, or would it be a significant headache? I was worried about `INTERVAL` fields but they seem to be returned to the consumer as strings, since conversion to Duration impls haven't been written yet.\r\n\r\nWhen I naively changed the field to `postgres` in my fork, connection succeeded and queries work.","closed_by":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
