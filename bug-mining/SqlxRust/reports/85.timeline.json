If this occurs, the leader will execute the portion of the plan below the Gather node entirely by itself, almost as if the Gather node were not present. This will happen if any of the following conditions are met:\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> [...]\r\n> The client sends an Execute message with a non-zero fetch count. See the discussion of the [extended query protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY). Since [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html) currently provides no way to send such a message, this can only occur when using a client that does not rely on libpq. If this is a frequent occurrence, it may be a good idea to set [max_parallel_workers_per_gather](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS-PER-GATHER) to zero in sessions where it is likely, so as to avoid generating query plans that may be suboptimal when run serially.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely unfortunate coincidence. \r\n\r\nWe currently send an Execute with a limit of 1 for `fetch_optional` and `fetch_one` to ensure the server does not waste resources sending additional rows if the user forgot to ensure that the query only returns one row. If the query returns additional rows, the server will be forced to send them all, and the driver would have to read through and discard them before it would be able to issue another command.\r\n\r\nThe only way to escape this requires closing the connection or calling `pg_cancel_backend()` from another connection.\r\n\r\nWe do send a fetch limit of zero for `.fetch()` but this also means that the server will keep sending rows even if the stream is dropped. I had plans to use non-zero fetch limits in the future to allow queries to be cancelled from the client side, since the driver could request rows in batches.\r\n\r\nThis must be what `node-postgres` does, which is why it has this problem with streaming queries but we don't.\r\n\r\nI would personally consider this a Postgres bug, although I can sort of understand why they punted on this. Having to enforce a limit would require additional synchronization between the workers. Though it makes me wonder how it handles `LIMIT` at the query level. The query planner must take that into account somehow, but the limit from the Execute message must not trigger a re-plan.\r\n\r\nFor aggregate queries like `SELECT sum(...)`, however, I would expect this to be trivial to handle. Without windowing, your repro query will only ever produce at most one row, so the limit on the Execute message shouldn't matter. That's likely just a special case that hasn't been covered.\r\n\r\nThe fix is theoretically trivial, as we could just always send a zero for the limit on Execute: https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/6b337668dedfed5a40f08df75e45121ec3a947e2/sqlx-postgres/src/connection/executor.rs#L250\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't likely be an issue for `.fetch_one()` and `.fetch_optional()` as long as the user is careful to ensure the query doesn't return a lot of additional rows. For completeness, we already warn about this in the documentation: https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/query/struct.Query.html#note-for-best-performance-ensure-the-query-returns-at-most-one-row\r\n\r\nFor `.fetch()`, however, we'd probably want to make this behavior toggleable, to ensure that users who need interruptible queries can have them.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it'd be nice if Postgres just handled this correctly, but someone would have to put in that work.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/comments/2579967070/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/comments/2581830357","html_url":"https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3673#issuecomment-2581830357","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3673","id":2581830357,"node_id":"IC_kwDODb6dM86Z45rV","user":{"login":"twitu","id":23196890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk2ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23196890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu","html_url":"https://github.com/twitu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twitu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-10T05:49:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T05:50:23Z","body":"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. Indeed, this is a subtle implementation detail.\r\n\r\nSo my understanding is that without limit = 0, the db will send all the selected rows. Even if `fetch_one`drops the stream after reading one row, the db will keep producing rows. This of course means wasted computation for a single row fetch. However setting limit = 1, means that the executor does not use parallel workers.\r\n\r\nIt is tricky because while `fetch_one` kind of implies that executor will only do the work needed to fetch one row but I also want the single row fetch to be as fast as possible. I, personally, am more inclined towards having the limit set to 0 for `fetch_one` and `fetch_optional` especially with the docs
