changes:\r\n\r\n* integer decoding will now loudly error on overflow instead of silently truncating.\r\n* some usages of the `query!()` macros might change an `i32` to an `i64`.\r\n\r\nAlso adds support for *decoding* `u64`s because there's no reason not to.\r\n\r\nCloses #3179\r\n\r\nSupercedes #3180\r\n\r\n@elsirion can you try this and confirm it fixes the problem?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12391023842,"node_id":"REFE_lADODb6dM86E4Em6zwAAAALikATi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/events/12391023842","actor":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"77c3fbda8ef20743b3898f893482f4fabaa686c8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/commits/77c3fbda8ef20743b3898f893482f4fabaa686c8","created_at":"2024-04-08T11:08:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12391045737,"node_id":"REFE_lADODb6dM86E4Em6zwAAAALikFpp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/events/12391045737","actor":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cef6cadc972463e1eecfc6b7a39ba9d09b879fe3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/commits/cef6cadc972463e1eecfc6b7a39ba9d09b879fe3","created_at":"2024-04-08T11:10:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12391070855,"node_id":"REFE_lADODb6dM86E4Em6zwAAAALikLyH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/events/12391070855","actor":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"effe29d0d541d5bee339ff76baec122f75e36297","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/commits/effe29d0d541d5bee339ff76baec122f75e36297","created_at":"2024-04-08T11:12:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12395378916,"node_id":"REFE_lADODb6dM86E4Em6zwAAAALi0njk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/events/12395378916","actor":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/user
