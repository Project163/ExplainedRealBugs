way SQLx can support more server versions, including CockroachDB, which only supports the `postgres` style.\r\n\r\nOf note: If we wanted to support conversion of PostgresSQL's `INTERVAL`s to a special type, we'd have to support all IntervalStyles anyway, in case somebody used `SET SESSION IntervalStyle` to change it after connection is established.\r\n\r\nFixes #130.\r\nI believe the current `master` struggles with Postgres tests a little so CI might fail.\r\n\r\nThanks for the immediate response
