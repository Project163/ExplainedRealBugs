URI and IRI are just confusing. In practice a single algorithm is used for both so keeping them distinct is not helping anyone. URL also easily wins the [search result popularity contest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=url,uri).\r\n\r\nWe already have `DATABASE_URL` and that's not going anywhere, so using \"URI\" in other places to refer to the same string format is just unnecessarily confusing.\r\n\r\nThis should be more or less a trivial find-replace so if someone wants an easy blip on their \"Contributions\" graph, this is a good issue to tackle.
