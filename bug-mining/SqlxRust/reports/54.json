Something like this would be better in my opinion:\r\n\r\n    [dependencies]\r\n    sqlx = { version = \"0.5\", features = [ \"postgres\" ] }\r\n    async-std = { version = \"1.9\", features = [ \"attributes\" ] }\r\n\r\n    # or for tokio runtime\r\n    # sqlx = { version = \"0.5\", features = [ \"runtime-tokio-rustls\" , \"postgres\" ] }\r\n    # tokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\r\n\r\nalso I saw from a pull request  #1479 that the async-std runtime is not on by default, so it even has to be like this (but untested):\r\n\r\n    [dependencies]\r\n    sqlx = { version = \"0.5\", features = [ \"runtime-async-std-native-tls\", \"postgres\" ] }\r\n    async-std = { version = \"1.9\", features = [ \"attributes\" ] }\r\n\r\n    # or for tokio runtime\r\n    # sqlx = { version = \"0.5\", features = [ \"runtime-tokio-rustls\" , \"postgres\" ] }\r\n    # tokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
