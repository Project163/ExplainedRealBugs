is happening because `#[sqlx::test]` emits code with the `#[test]` attribute in it (expecting the `#[test]` from std) but because you've shadowed that with `#[macro_use] extern crate sqlx;` it just recurses into itself instead.\r\n\r\nIt looks like `#[tokio::test]` avoids this problem by referencing the `#[test]` attribute with its fully qualified path: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/master/tokio-macros/src/entry.rs#L378\r\n\r\nSo the fix would be to just do the same thing [here](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/sqlx-macros/src/test_attr.rs#L55) and [here](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/sqlx-macros/src/test_attr.rs#L108).\r\n\r\nIn the
