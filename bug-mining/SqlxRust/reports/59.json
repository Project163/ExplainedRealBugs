WHERE something IN ($1)` with `$1` bound to my slice of `Transparent` values.\r\n\r\nPer [the relevant FAQ entry](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-do-a-select--where-foo-in--query), I tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsqlx::query(\"SELECT ... WHERE something = ANY($1);\")\r\n    .bind(values) // values is &[Transparent]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut compiling this gives me the error `` the trait `PgHasArrayType` is not implemented for `Transparent` ``.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I map out the inner primitive value by doing something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet primitive_values: Vec<_> = values.iter().map(|v| v.0).collect();\r\nsqlx::query(\"SELECT ... WHERE something = ANY($1);\")\r\n    .bind(&primitive_values) // primitive_values is &[i32]\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen I *don't* get the compiler error.\r\n\r\nI expected both of these to compile and function in the same way.\r\n\r\nI've tried to make a minimal test case [in this PR I made to my own fork](https://github.com/integer32llc/sqlx/pull/1/files) so that I could demonstrate [the compiler error happens in CI](https://github.com/integer32llc/sqlx/runs/5502833712?check_suite_focus=true#step:7:98).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to submit that test case as a PR here if it's useful, but I wasn't sure enough that this use case is supported or that I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
