I have a number of queries using the sqlx::query function that run in sequence and after the upgrade I see the following error seemingly at random:\r\n\r\n`thread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'unable to close due to unfinalized statements or unfinished backups', .cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/sqlx-core-0.5.7/src/sqlite/connection/handle.rs:68:17`\r\n\r\nIf I downgrade back to version 0.5.5 I no longer experience this issue. I have the following features enabled: \"runtime-tokio-native-tls\", \"sqlite\", \"migrate\". Version of SQLite is 3.31.1-4ubuntu0.2 amd64, running on Ubuntu Focal.\r\n\r\nFor now running version 0.5.5 allows me to continue so it's not critical but I wanted to make sure an issue was opened.
