Tried to base it on our discussion as closely as possible.","closed_by":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/87/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
