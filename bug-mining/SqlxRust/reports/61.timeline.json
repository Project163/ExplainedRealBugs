took a stab at #60. The real way to do this, I think, is with an `OUTER JOIN` on users and responses, so you can do an `ORDER BY responses.response DESC` and get the users that have responded first. However, `OUTER JOIN` seems to be broken in some cases, see https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1249.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I do two selects, first only selecting candidates who have accepted, and only if that fails do I then fall back to the original select.\r\n\r\nUntil that bug gets fixed, I can't think of a better way to do this 🤷‍♀️\r\n\r\nThis might be easiest to review commit by commit.

Either the query is DISTINCT or else the ON or USING clause on the LEFT JOIN constrains the join such that it matches only a single row \r\n\r\nas `user_state.user_id`and `account.user_id` are `UNIQUE`, it will always return a single row,\r\n\r\nI think a successful test of the left join strength reduction also causing a problem is:\r\n> A LEFT JOIN can sometimes be converted into an ordinary JOIN if there are terms in the WHERE clause that guarantee that the two joins will give identical results.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"accounts\" (\r\n    \"user_id\" TEXT
