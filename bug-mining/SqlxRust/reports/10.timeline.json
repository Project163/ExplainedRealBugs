No combination of different syntax when specifying a database url allows for a connection to a server where no password is present.  \r\n\r\nWhen attempting to connect to a database URL where no password is present, either the username of the connection will be interpreted incorrectly, or the blank/empty/\"null\" password will.  \r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Have a mysql/MariaDB database without a password\r\n2. Specify database url and connect via SQLx\r\n3. Connection will fail due to syntax handling of database URL string in one of two ways\r\n\r\nI have attempted all possible ways of specifying the database URL that I can think of.  Here are a few of the ones I have tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet database_url = \"mysql://username:@localhost/database\";\r\nlet database_url = \"mysql://username:@localhost/database?password=\";\r\nlet database_url = \"mysql://username:''@localhost/database?password=\";\r\nlet database_url = \"mysql://'username':@localhost/database?password=\";\r\nlet database_url = \"mysql://username@localhost/database?user=username\";\r\nlet database_url = \"mysql://username:@localhost/database?user=username\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake the first line as an example.  The password should be recognized as nonexistent by SQLx, and treated as such.  Instead, the user will be met with an error that the connection failed such as follows: `Access denied for user ''@'localhost' to database xxx`.  Note the two single quotes before the @ character, indicating that the username is read as null as opposed to the password.  Attempts to remedy this do not offer any resolution, as specifying any value at all for a password will result in a failed connection due to the password not matching the database's lack of one.  \r\n\r\nThis seems similar to a previous bug found here: https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/203  \r\n\r\n### Info\r\n* SQLx version: 0.8.1\r\n* SQLx features enabled: \"runtime-async-std\", \"mysql\"\r\n* Database server and version: MariaDB Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.11.8-MariaDB\r\n* Operating system: Rocky Linux\r\n* `rustc --version`: rustc 1.79.0 (129f3b996 2024-06-10)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/3484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
