Noticed my CI starting failing with 35 errors some time this afternoon when installing `sqlx-cli`. The exact errors all vary, but they all make reference to the the derive macro `Clap`. Comparing my most recent successful logs, it looks like the CLI is now pulling in `clap_derive` v3.0.0-beta.4 when it was using v3.0.0-beta.2.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this on my local machine after uninstalling and attempting to reinstall.","closed_by":{"login":"abonander","id":3198595,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTg1OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3198595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander","html_url":"https://github.com/abonander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abonander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1378/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/1378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
