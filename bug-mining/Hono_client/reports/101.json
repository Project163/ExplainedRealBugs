with Command and Control, the adapter sends the command to the device it sends a request-id. This request-id needs to be used to send the command response back to the adapter from the device. (It is not defined how this id is structured or how long it is)\r\n\r\nIt need to transport the reply-id to build or find the AMQP response link and also the correlation-id to send with each command response to the application.\r\n\r\nAt the the moment this reply-id is very long, because it is build up of two UUIDs.\r\n\r\nThis could be reduced in our client implementation:\r\n\r\n- The message-id, which is always scoped to the one link could be a simple counter.\r\n- The uniqueness of the link (for this tenant/device combination) depends on the application and how much instances will communicate with the device at the same time. So this should be settable by the application. In most cases a single character like 'a' should be enough.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pellmann","id":12810428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODEwNDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12810428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann","html_url":"https://github.com/pellmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pellmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/707/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
