observed behaviour:**\r\n1) Hono PA connecting to Hono Messaging\r\n2) Due to issues on network layer the IP address of Hono Messaging was a blackhole (receiving messages but never replying)\r\n3) Due to ProtonClientOptions.setReconnectAttempts(-1)\r\nio/vertx/core/impl/netClientImpl.java:doConnect will retry forever (TCP SYN).\r\n\r\n**Points that need improvement:**\r\n* This will not perform a new lookup of the IP address. Especially in the situations when a DNS name is backed by many (changing) IP addresses, the client might be able to recover by doing a fresh lookup.\r\n* Hono disconnect handler does not get called, thus no logging.\r\n\r\n**I was able to reproduce the behaviour using the Example client:**\r\n* ProtonClientOptions.setReconnectAttempts(-1)\r\n* Use an http endpoint as destination (which will silently discard amqp traffic)\r\n* I see the same TCP SYN forever without recovery\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to change the Proton reconnect to a value that makes sense: 2\r\nIf the handshake does not work on the Proton level, control shall move back to Hono's reconnect handler.\r\n\r\nWe can then introduce a HonoReconnectAttempts that will control the number of reattempts done by Hono's reconnect handler.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am proposing this is that in my opinion a client should behave as graceful as possible. With this behavioural change, the client will be able to recover from some real world error conditions.\r\n\r\nSome pseudo code:\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/client/impl/HonoClientImpl.java b/client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/client/impl/HonoClientImpl.java\r\nindex 27c8efa..3872ace 100644\r\n--- a/client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/client/impl/HonoClientImpl.java\r\n+++ b/client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/client/impl/HonoClientImpl.java\r\n@@ -30,6 +30,7 @@ import java.util.function.BiConsumer;\r\n import java.util.function.Consumer;\r\n import java.util.function.Supplier;\r\n \r\n+import io.vertx.core.net.NetClientOptions;\r\n import org.apache.qpid.proton.amqp.Symbol;\r\n import org.apache.qpid.proton.message.Message;\r\n import org.eclipse.hono.cache.CacheProvider;\r\n@@ -389,13 +390,16 @@ public class HonoClientImpl implements HonoClient {\r\n             final Handler<AsyncResult<HonoClient>> connectionHandler,\r\n             final Handler<ProtonConnection> disconnectHandler) {\r\n \r\n+        int honoReconnects = 1000;\r\n+        LOG.info(\"Failed :(\", connectionFailureCause);\r\n+\r\n         if (shuttingDown.get()) {\r\n             // no need to try to re-connect\r\n             connectionHandler.handle(Future.failedFuture(new IllegalStateException(\"client is shut down\")));\r\n-        } else if (clientOptions.getReconnectAttempts() - reconnectAttempts.get() == 0) {\r\n+        } else if (honoReconnects - reconnectAttempts.get() == 0) {\r\n             reconnectAttempts = new AtomicInteger(0);\r\n             LOG.debug(\"max number of attempts [{}] to re-connect to peer [{}:{}] have been made, giving up\",\r\n-                    clientOptions.getReconnectAttempts(), connectionFactory.getHost(), connectionFactory.getPort());\r\n+                    honoReconnects, connectionFactory.getHost(), connectionFactory.getPort());\r\n             if (connectionFailureCause == null) {\r\n                 connectionHandler.handle(Future.failedFuture(\r\n                         new ServerErrorException(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_UNAVAILABLE, \"failed to connect\")));\r\ndiff --git a/example/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/example/AbstractExampleClient.java b/example/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/example/AbstractExampleClient.java\r\nindex 6a9d135..35ff0d9 100644\r\n--- a/example/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/example/AbstractExampleClient.java\r\n+++ b/example/src/main/java/org/eclipse/hono/example/AbstractExampleClient.java\r\n@@ -35,6 +35,7 @@ abstract class AbstractExampleClient {\r\n \r\n     protected final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());\r\n     protected final int DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS = 1000;\r\n+    protected final int DEFAULT_PROTON_CONNECT_RETRIES = 2;\r\n \r\n     protected Context ctx;\r\n     @Value(value = \"${tenant.id}\")\r\n@@ -66,6 +67,6 @@ abstract class AbstractExampleClient {\r\n     }\r\n \r\n     protected final ProtonClientOptions getClientOptions() {\r\n-        return new ProtonClientOptions().setConnectTimeout(DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS).setReconnectAttempts(2);\r\n+        return new ProtonClientOptions().setConnectTimeout(DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS).setReconnectAttempts(DEFAULT_PROTON_CONNECT_RETRIES);\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"pho-enix","id":19666623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjY2NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19666623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix","html_url":"https://github.com/pho-enix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pho-enix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
