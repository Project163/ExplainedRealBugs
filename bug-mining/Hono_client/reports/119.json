the underlying implementation offers such a possibility.\r\nMethods for `getting the current credits` and to `set a drain handler` are necessary to offer.\r\n\r\nRemark: to rely on the `ttd` event is not sufficient, since the event may be delivered at a point of time when a `flow frame` (that announces new credits) was not received yet - resulting in no credits if a `send` is invoked directly after receiving the `ttd` event.","closed_by":{"login":"sysexcontrol","id":24588266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTg4MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24588266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol","html_url":"https://github.com/sysexcontrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
