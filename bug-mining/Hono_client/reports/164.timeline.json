019-05-14T13:22:52Z","body":"Here's how I would suggest introducing these changes:\r\n\r\n- Next Hono milestone (M4): \r\n  - **Introduce new endpoint for sending commands (with gateway-mapping feature)**\r\nApplications can already use the new `control_request/${tenant_id}` endpoint and the provided command client classes will use that too.\r\nThe existing `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}` endpoint will still work, but will lack the gateway-mapping feature.\r\n  - Add support for using `control_response/${tenant_id}/${reply_id}` as command response receiver address. The existing `control/${tenant_id}/${reply_id}` address shall still work as well. [1]\r\n  - Deprecate both the `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}` endpoint for sending commands and the `control/${tenant_id}/${reply_id}` endpoint for receiving command responses.\r\n- Hono 1.0 or possibly later:\r\n  - For Command sender links:\r\nChange `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}` to `control_request_internal/${tenant_id}/${device_id}`.\r\nOnly Protocol Adapter users shall get access to `control_request_internal` addresses then.\r\n  - For Command response receiver links:\r\nMake `control/${tenant_id}/${reply_id}` an invalid address; only `control_response/${tenant_id}/${reply_id}` shall be used.\r\n\r\n[1] Supporting both response address styles will require some changes in the current implementation (e.g. also in the `CommandConsumerFactory` interface). Things would be easier if we could switch from the old to the new pattern in one go. But then there would be no smooth migration
