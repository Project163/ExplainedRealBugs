Given the following setup:\r\n\r\n- flowLatency of 200ms leads to no credit issues in our infrastructure from time to time\r\n- So I thought flowLatency of 1000ms should be really enough even in our setup\r\n\r\nWe now get \"always\" credits, however the creation of the sender gets delayed very often by a second. This causes for example that the device needs to wait 1 second for a response to a telemetry message or a command sender for the command response.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible from a technical point of view to wait for credits only as long as required (as CreditBasedSender does)? Do you think this would be an improvement for hono client or do you just say \"get your infrastructure fixed\"? \r\n\r\nEven with this in place we would still have the \"issue\" that sender links with no corresponding receiver links need to wait the maximum amount of time.","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
