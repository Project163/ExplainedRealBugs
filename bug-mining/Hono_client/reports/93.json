there is a `HonoClient#connect()` method, but no `HonoClient#disconnect()` method.\r\n\r\nA \"disconnect\" method is for example needed in a scenario where the open frame of the connection contained permissions from an authorization service and these permissions in the service have changed since opening the connection, making it necessary to disconnect and re-open the connection.\r\n\r\nI could imagine a simple method with no parameters and return value here:\r\n``\r\nvoid disconnect();\r\n``\r\nNotification of a finished disconnect will be done on the `disconnectHandler` supplied to the `connect` method.","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
