Hono documentation says Events should be flagged as *durable*, and for good reason[1]:\r\n\r\n> Events provide a different quality of service for messages sent to the Event endpoint by setting the durable property of the message header to `true`.\r\n\r\nHowever the outgoing messages are not set *durable*. There is a method `addEndpointSpecificProperties` which should take care of this, but it seems never to be called.\r\n\r\nI think this originates from the confusing number of \"send*\" methods. Maybe it is time to clean those up.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.eclipse.org/hono/api/event-api/","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
