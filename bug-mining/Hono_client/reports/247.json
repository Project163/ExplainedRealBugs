`honoConnection.disconnect` on a HonoConnection, where a connection attempt is currently in progress, doesn't lead to the connection attempt to be aborted.\r\nThis means the HonoConnection will possibly be connected after that although the invoking code doesn't expect it to be and although the HonoConnection object possibly isn't being worked with anymore.\r\n\r\nFor the Hono Integration tests this could mean that unused connections get created that aren't getting disconnected and thereby fill up the Qdrouter `maxConnectionsPerHost` limit defined in the `qdrouterd-with-broker.json`.","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
