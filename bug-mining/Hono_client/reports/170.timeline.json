case there are a lot of traces being generated for a particular tenant, it would be a good feature to have an option to only force sampling of *error traces* for that particular tenant.\r\n\r\nThis

`trace-sampling-mode-per-device` can be set with a map value where a field with the device id as name and a value of \"all\" (meaning sampling of all traces is enforced) or \"default\" is set.\r\n````\r\n  {\r\n    \"tenant-id\": \"DEFAULT_TENANT\",\r\n    \"enabled\": true,\r\n    \"trace-sampling-mode-per-device\": {\r\n      \"4711\": \"all\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n````\r\n\r\n**Limitations:**\r\nThe sampling of traces can only be enforced by setting a \"sampling-priority\" tag on all spans that shall be sampled. That means that all spans created and finished *before* getting the tenant Json can not be taken into account here. For example, from all the spans created as part of uploading telemetry data in the HTTP protocol adapter:\r\n````\r\nhono-adapter-http: POST\r\n  hono-adapter-http: authenticate device\r\n    hono-adapter-http: get Credentials\r\n      hono-service-device-registry: process request message\r\n        hono-service-device-registry: get Credentials\r\n    hono-adapter-http: validate Credentials\r\n  hono-adapter-http: upload telemetry\r\n    hono-adapter-http: get Tenant by ID\r\n      hono-service-device-registry: process request message\r\n        hono-service-device-registry: get Tenant\r\n    hono-adapter-http: assert Device Registration\r\n      hono-service-device-registry: process request message\r\n        hono-service-device-registry: assert Device Registration\r\nhono-adapter-http: forward Telemetry data\r\n````\r\nonly these get forcefully sampled for now:\r\n````\r\nhono-adapter-http: POST\r\n  hono-adapter-http: upload telemetry\r\n    hono-adapter-http: assert Device Registration\r\n      hono-service-device-registry: process request message\r\n        hono-service-device-registry: assert Device Registration\r\nhono-adapter-http: forward Telemetry data\r\n````\r\n\r\n**Scope:**\r\nAs part of this PR, the feature has been implemented for the HTTP, MQTT and AMQP adapters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1356/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2486205256,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNDg2MjA1MjU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2486205256","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-16T13:43:41Z","assignee":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2486206001,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI0ODYyMDYwMDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2486206001","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-16T13:43:55Z","label":{"name":"Tracing","color":"69efac"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2486206386,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDI0ODYyMDYzODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2486206386","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-16T13:44:03Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2486585738,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5j
