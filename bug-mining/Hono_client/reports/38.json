AMQP messages produced by protocol adapters for telemetry/event data currently contain the originating device's registration assertion in the message's *application-properties* as defined by the *Telemetry* and *Event* APIs. However, *application-properties* are required to be propagated by any intermediary AMQP node, which means that we forward the assertion from Hono Messaging to the AMQP Messaging Network and from there to the final consumer of the data. This seems to be a waste of bandwidth since the assertions are only required and processed by Hono Messaging. It therefore seems to make sense to move the registration assertion to the AMQP *delivery-annotations* and have Hono Messaging simply remove it when forwarding a telemetry/event message downstream.","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
