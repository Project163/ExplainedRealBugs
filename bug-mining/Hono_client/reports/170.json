OpenTracing Specification allows setting a specific tag (`sampling.priority` - see [Span tags](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md#span-tags-table)), \r\nwith which it can be enforced that trace spans are actually captured in the Tracing component.\r\n\r\nTo enable debugging of problems related to messages of a specific tenant in Hono, it would be good to be able to define such an enforced trace sampling for all spans regarding that specific tenant.\r\n\r\nFor that, the tenant JSON structure, as defined in the Tenant API, could be extended with an additional, optional attribute: `tracing-sampling-priority` (integer). \r\nIt's semantics should follow the one given for the `sampling.priority` tag:\r\n````\r\nIf greater than 0, a hint to the Tracer to do its best to capture the trace. \r\nIf 0, a hint to the trace to not-capture the trace. \r\nIf absent, the Tracer should use its default sampling mechanism.\r\n````\r\nFor completeness, I would suggest having a value of `-1` be equivalent with the value being absent.\r\n\r\nThis `tracing-sampling-priority` setting of a tenant should then be applied (in the sense of setting the `sampling.priority` tag) to the traces associated with that tenant.\r\n\r\nEDIT: this issue shall track the implementation of this feature for the HTTP adapter only.","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
