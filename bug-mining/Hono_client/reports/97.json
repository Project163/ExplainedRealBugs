is often hard to follow specific problems from end-to-end. This is true in particular with many different devices talking to Hono with different adapters on one side and also many different consumers and tenants on the other side.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for the solution developer to get an idea of the real message flow and what happens. It is also hard to identify a problem if a customers calls the DevOps with \"My message never arrives..\".\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nAllow an option in  the Device Registry to set a device (or a class of devices or a tenant) in a debug state. This could trigger different actions (dependent an the specific state):\r\n\r\n- Extend the normal tracing/logging of the components, that are involved. Typically at least the Adapter and Hono Messaging.\r\n- Add debugging information of each involved component to the message. This could be done with specified message properties.\r\n\r\nWDYT?","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/319/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
