`HonoConnection.createSender()` doesn't allow the link target address to be `null`.\r\n\r\nThat is however a valid use case since a `null` address is used to establish a sender link to the anonymous relay (see [here](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/anonterm/v1.0/anonterm-v1.0.html) or the [ProtonConnection](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-proton/blob/c02a1a4bce17daf8626c9eb11afd30857ffdbf02/src/main/java/io/vertx/proton/ProtonConnection.java#L77) class).\r\n\r\nAnd that is especially useful for creating a telemetry/event sender link to the Hono AMQP adapter, which requires such a link on the anonymous relay.","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1541/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
