relates to #930 and #1073.\r\n\r\nThe old northbound and southbound \"control\" endpoints should be removed.\r\nThis also entails removing the bit flag encoded in the device-facing reply-to address (see `org.eclipse.hono.client.Command#FLAG_*`) and removing the \"*LegacyEndpoint*\" test classes (having `useLegacyCommandEndpoint` return true).\r\n\r\nNote: The `CommandConsumerFactoryImpl` still needs to work with two kinds of receiver links. The receiver link with the \"control\" address needs its address renamed to something like \"cmd_internal\". `DelegatedCommandSenderImpl` needs to target that endpoint then.\r\n\r\nIt has still got to be decided, at which point these things should be done.","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
