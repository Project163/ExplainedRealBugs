the protocol adapters set a TTL on downstream events as follows:\r\n1. if message contains a TTL, keep it\r\n2.1. otherwise, if a default TTL is set at the tenant level, use it\r\n2.2. if a default TTL is set at the device level, use it.\r\n\r\nIn production environments, however, a service provider will probably want to be able to set an upper limit for message TTL in order to ensure reasonable resource utilization.\r\n\r\nIn such a scenario, the *max TTL* would not be settable by the tenant but by the service provider only and the protocol adapters should ensure that the TTL set on a downstream event does not exceed the max TTL. It seems to make sense to be able to support both, a *default TTL* and a *max TTL* at the tenant level so that downstream events can get a default TTL value but adapters can also use the max TTL as an upper limit if a default TTL is specified at the device level by the device owner.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
