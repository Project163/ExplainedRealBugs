All ulong keys, and all symbolic keys except those beginning with \"x-\" are reserved. Keys beginning with \"x-opt-\" MUST be ignored if not understood. On receiving an annotation key which is not understood, and which does not begin with \"x-opt\", the receiving AMQP container MUST detach the link with a not-implemented error. \r\n\r\nWhat seems to happen right now is that the `MessageAnnotationsInjectAdapter` is being used in combination with the `TEXT_MAP` format, which would directly inject `uber-trace-id` and `uberctx-*` into the message annotation map (see: `io.jaegertracing.internal.propagation.TextMapCodec`):\r\n\r\nSo it might happen, that a receiver simply closes this link when the annotation is present in the map.\r\n\r\nThe proposal would be to use something like `x-opt-opentracing-trace-id` and `x-opt-opentracing-ctx-` instead.
