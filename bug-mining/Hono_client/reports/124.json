The adapter therefore gets no indication whether the command has been accepted by the device and thus immediately sends back an *accepted* disposition to the application as soon as it has published the command (using QoS 0).\r\n\r\nWe already allow devices to publish their response to a command using QoS 1 so it seems to make sense to support QoS 1 for the other direction as well. Allowing the device to indicate a QoS level of 1 in its SUBSCRIBE packet would give the adapter a chance to use the PUBACK from the device as a trigger to send back the *accepted* disposition to the application. If no PUBACK arrives from the device the adapter could either simply do nothing, i.e. do not send back a disposition frame at all or it could send back a *released* disposition after a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/832/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
