relates to #1012 and #1046 and is about where to write/read trace-context information in AMQP messages sent/received by Hono.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when sending AMQP messages, Hono puts trace-context information in the *message annotations* of the message, inside a `x-opt-trace-context` map. This `x-opt-trace-context` map name is purely arbitrary and not specified in any standard. This means that when using AMQP messaging in connection with Eclipse Ditto for example (e.g. via the iot-packages [cloud2edge](https://github.com/eclipse/packages/tree/master/packages/cloud2edge) chart with the [AMQP messaging](https://github.com/eclipse/packages/blob/master/packages/cloud2edge/profileAmqpMessaging-values.yaml) and [tracing](https://github.com/eclipse/packages/blob/master/packages/cloud2edge/profileTracing-values.yaml) profiles), there are no combined traces between Hono and Ditto, as Ditto reads/writes trace-context information differently (Ditto uses the AMQP message *application properties*).\r\n\r\nAs for a standard format in this regard, there is a W3C First Public Working Draft of an AMQP trace context protocol specification (see https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-amqp/).\r\nThe \"[2.1 Trace context fields placement in a message](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context-amqp/#trace-context-fields-placement-in-a-message)\" chapter there basically states:\r\n- Message publishers write tracing context values in the message **_application-properties_** (which are immutable)\r\n- Intermediaries cannot edit the *message-annotations*, instead they use the **_message-annotations_** to include their trace context\r\n\r\nTo note here is that the _message annotations_ must only contain registered keys or keys that start with `x-`.\r\nThe `traceparent` and `tracestate` keys have not been registered yet - there's an [open issue](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context-amqp/issues/2) for that.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>For context: Definition of AMQP Application properties</summary>\r\n  \r\n\r\n> The application-properties section is a part of the bare message used for structured application data. Intermediaries can use the data within this structure for the purposes of filtering or routing.\r\n> \r\n> The keys of this map are restricted to be of type string (which excludes the possibility of a null key) and the values are restricted to be of simple types only, that is, excluding map, list, and array types. \r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>For context: Definition of AMQP message annotations</summary>\r\n  \r\n\r\n> The message-annotations section is used for properties of the message which are aimed at the infrastructure and SHOULD be propagated across every delivery step. Message annotations convey information about the message. Intermediaries MUST propagate the annotations unless the annotations are explicitly augmented or modified (e.g., by the use of the modified outcome).\r\n> \r\n> The capabilities negotiated on link attach and on the source and target can be used to establish which annotations a peer understands; however, in a network of AMQP intermediaries it might not be possible to know if every intermediary will understand the annotation. Note that for some annotations it might not be necessary for the intermediary to understand their purpose, i.e., they could be used purely as an attribute which can be filtered on.\r\n> \r\n> A registry of defined annotations and their meanings is maintained [AMQPMESSANN].\r\n> \r\n> If the message-annotations section is omitted, it is equivalent to a message-annotations section containing an empty map of annotations. \r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI think the most straightforward way to allow integration of Hono traces with other applications would be to let Hono write the trace-context to the message ***application properties***.\r\nOn a purely technical level, Hono is anyway the publisher, not an intermediary, of the AMQP messages. This is the case even for AMQP telemetry/event messages received by the AMQP adapter - their properties/message annotations are not adopted for the corresponding messages that the AMQP adapter sends downstream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/3597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/3597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
