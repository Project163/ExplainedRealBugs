protocol adapters create AMQP sender links for events and telemetry data for each tenant on the first message for a particular tenant. However, these links get never closed. Would it be an improvement to close these links after some time of inactivity, as links require some memory on both ends? From my point of view this inactivity period might be quite high per default, e.g. one day. \r\n\r\nBackground: We execute some system tests periodically with new tenant for each test and delete these tenants afterwards. Over time we get many open sender links in protocol adapters that will never be needed again. These sender links get closed only when the connection gets closed, e.g. when we restart protocol adapter.\r\n\r\nWDYT? Is this requirement to specific to our setup or might others also run into this issue?","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1188/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
