#1916 has been created for using the ttd as the lifespan of the mapping entry in the device connection service.\r\n\r\nFor the cases where no ttd is given and a periodic refresh of the mapping entry shall be done, a new Device Connection API method is needed for the refresh operation, performing a _conditional update_. \r\nIt has to be ensured that the refresh operation doesn't overwrite a different adapter instance value, set in the meantime by a command subscription from another adapter instance.\r\nFor that, a new `replaceCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` operation, with parameters in analogy to `Map.replace(key,oldValue,newValue)`, should be introduced in the Device Connection

is for #1858 and replaces #1922:\r\n\"Command handling adapter instance\" entries may expire.\r\nTherefore, getting a NOT FOUND result when invoking `removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance()` shouldn't be treated as an error.\r\n\r\nFor that, the `DeviceConnectionClient.removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` method has been changed to return a `Future<Boolean>` now (instead of `Future<Void>`), with a `false` value returned if a NOT FOUND was received from the server.\r\n\r\nWhen a command consumer is closed, the `removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` method is still called every time - just to be on the safe side, even though the entry might have been already deleted because it has expired.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3279041814,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyNzkwNDE4MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/3279041814","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"57b0b8380895834c237516ad153422841ba3b30b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/commits/57b0b8380895834c237516ad153422841ba3b30b","created_at":"2020-04-28T07:54:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
