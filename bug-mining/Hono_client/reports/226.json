from the discussion in https://github.com/eclipse/hono/pull/2108#issuecomment-672876675:\r\n\r\nWhen processing an incoming telemetry/event message in a protocol adapter, the associated tenant should be determined at the beginning of the message processing and the `TenantObject` should be put in the `ExecutionContext` (e.g. `MqttContext`) for that request . \r\n\r\nThis allows to decide early on, which trace sampling mode to use for that request, and for example also allows to check the concurrent connections for that tenant before doing more expensive checks later on in request processing.\r\n\r\nWhile the tenant retrieval is already done early on right now, the `TenantObject` isn't made available via the `ExecutionContext` yet.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
