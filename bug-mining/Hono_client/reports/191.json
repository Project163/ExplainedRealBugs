the implementation of #930, we have added support for gateways creating command subscriptions without having to use individual device ids. \r\n\r\nThe gateway will for example just create a MQTT subscription or AMQP receiver link on the `command` topic/link address. Northbound applications will send commands with the specific device id in the message address and the gateway mapping logic (based on the `lastKnownGateway` information for the device) will forward such commands to the corresponding gateway.\r\n\r\n*What is not currently possible* in such a scenario is that the applications will get notified of when a particular device is ready to receive commands.\r\n\r\nThat however is a cornerstone of the Hono command & control feature in how it is defined for non-gateway devices.\r\n\r\nIn order to support this principle also for gateways, the command handling logic in the protocol adapters should be adapted to enable gateways to alternatively subscribe for commands of a specific device.\r\nHono currently doesn't support this because there would be *device*-specific AMQP consumers created in the protocol adapter, whereas the gateway mapping logic would always redirect the command to a *gateway*-specific consumer.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving such a command subscription with a device id from a gateway, the protocol adapter should forward a corresponding notification with the device id to the northbound application.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, the goal here would be to have gateways be able to\r\n- either create a single subscription for commands regarding *all devices* that are currently mapped to the gateway (there will be no individual device-ready-for-commands notification here)\r\n- or create individual command subscriptions for specific devices - with corresponding downstream notifications.\r\n\r\n---\r\nAs to the implementation of this:\r\nEven though the device id is given with the subscription request, the protocol adapter shall create/use a gateway-specific command consumer and map the command received on that consumer to the original device of that command.","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1523/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
