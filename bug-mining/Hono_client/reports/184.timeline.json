This \"terminal error\" will stop the client from trying to re-connect, and it seems like it never will re-try again. For as long as process is alive. So effectively, the process would be dead now.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the protocol adapters has been implemented this way deliberately in order to prevent useless connection attempts to services with which no connection can be established due to misconfiguration (on either the client or server side).\r\n\r\n> It looks to me, as if the correct way to signal the \"terminal error\", is not through the \"readiness\" check, but through the \"liveness\" check instead.\r\n\r\nI do not think that there is a right or wrong way here. We need to address two different scenarios here:\r\n1. The service we try to connect to is implemented/configured correctly but is not (yet) ready for operation, i.e. it is in the process of starting up or we have temporarily lost network connection to it. In any case, once we are able to reach the service, a connection will be established.\r\n2. The service is wrongly implemented or there is a configuration mismatch between the adapter and the service. This means that no matter how often we try to connect to the adapter, the connection attempt will always fail unless the configuration/implementation is fixed.\r\n\r\nThe first case is already covered by the current re-connect behavior. \r\n\r\n> Additionally, I would question the idea of a terminal error altogether. From what I see in our case, it has to do with an invalid service credential. So that problem will go away in a minute.\r\n\r\nWhile the problem might be easy to fix (in most cases), whether it happens or not depends on an operator to become aware of it. I agree that with the current implementation this will be hard to detect as the adapter process seems to be running happily while in fact it doesn't try to (re-)establish a connection anymore.\r\n\r\n> I think we should:\r\n    Trigger a liveness failure in case of a terminal error.\r\n    Event for a terminal error, allow to try again.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the second item is supposed to mean. But I would rather simply allow the adapter to try to re-connect in case of a terminal error instead of restarting the whole pod based on a failed liveness check, which is much slower and more costly.\r\n\r\nFMPOV the readiness check is still the right way to make sure that\r\n1. operators become aware of a problem with the adapter/service\r\n1. allow the adapter to *auto recover* from the existing problem\r\n\r\nThe liveness check does not add much value here FMPOV because we would use it basically do the same as the HonoClient already does, i.e. trying to establish the connection once more.\r\n\r\nHowever, the startup of the adapter does not need to depend on the successful establishment of the connections to the services because with the re-try behavior of the HonoClient, we already make sure that the connections get established eventually and the readiness check already signals to Kubernetes when this is the case.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/527356411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T08:20:09Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T08:20:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1472","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1472/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1472/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1472/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/pull/1472","id":488444338,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzEzNDYyNDQx","number":1472,"title":"[#1471]
