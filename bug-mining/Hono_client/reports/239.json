new AMQP 1.0 adapter client for accessing Hono's service APIs currently simply wraps the legacy client implementation under the hood. This also means that responses from the services are being cached at the tenant scoped link level. As a consequence, the cache is being removed/cleared if the underlying connection to the service is lost. This is in stark contrast to the overall intention of caching the responses in the first place, which is to be able to return values from the cache until the connection has been re-established.\r\n\r\nThe new client interfaces all accept the tenant ID as a parameter and therefore allow to cache values for all tenants at the service client level. The (new) client implementations need to be updated accordingly.","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
