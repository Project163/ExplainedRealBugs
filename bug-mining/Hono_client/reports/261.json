Some of the early PoC work align with this, showing that protocol adapters can reduce ~2x memory footprint with Quarkus JVM image and ~4x with the native one. Also, the startup times are improved for an order of magnitude.\r\n\r\nThis is an umbrella issue for this work which will consists of multiple tasks of introducing the Quarkus alternative for all Hono services in parallel to what we have now. And finally remove the Spring boot dependency when it's not needed anymore.","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2103/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
