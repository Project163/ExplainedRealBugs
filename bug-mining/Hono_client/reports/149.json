So far by messaging flow (specifically through HTTP protocol) a lookup operation against the credentials store is to be performed each time the device sends message through the adapter. That might turn to be costly in term of many resulting request timeouts when applying huge messaging load to the adapter. Therefore, implementing lookup caching mechanism for device credentials in the adapter may solve the issue here.","closed_by":{"login":"almheida","id":46742841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzQyODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46742841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida","html_url":"https://github.com/almheida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/almheida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
