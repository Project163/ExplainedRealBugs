That said, a particular device can have arbitrary *authentication ID*s associated with it (using the Credentials API). This accounts for use cases where a device is capable of using multiple transport protocols (and authentication mechanisms) or rotating keys.\r\nHowever, when a device connects to a protocol adapter and gets authenticated, its *device ID* is resolved based on the credentials (*auth ID* + secret) the device provides. Thus, if two devices use the same credentials during authentication, they are resolved to the same *device ID*, i.e. Hono treats them as the same device.\r\nWith gateways there are two scenarios possible:\r\n\r\n1. The gateway *acts on behalf of* the sensors attached to it, i.e. each sensor is represented by its own *device ID* in Hono and the gateway effectively acts as a proxy only and is not represented by a *device ID* in Hono.\r\n1. The sensors attached to the gateway are managed as *resources* or *properties* of the gateway itself but only the gateway is represented by a *device ID* in Hono. The Eclipse Kura gateway for example follows this approach.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/346244133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1353357561,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzNTMzNTc1NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/1353357561","actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-22T05:00:45Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/346264848","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/416#issuecomment-346264848","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/416","id":346264848,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjI2NDg0OA==","user":{"login":"zubairhamed","id":2336402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzY0MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2336402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed","html_url":"https://github.com/zubairhamed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zubairhamed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-22T07:24:10Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T07:24:10Z","body":"Hi

We have been giving this some thought but it would probably require some more sophisticated authorization model than what we currently have in place.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/346277254/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/346844979","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/416#issuecomment-346844979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/416","id":346844979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Njg0NDk3OQ==","user":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-24T14:51:22Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T14:51:22Z","body":"One possible approach to the use case where a gateway *acts on behalf* of another device:\r\n1. The gateway connects to adapter and provides credentials for authenticating the gateway, the gateway also includes tenant and device ID of the device it wants to report data for (e.g. in a header or the request URI)\r\n1. The adapter authenticates the gateway in the usual way\r\n1. The adapter asks the Device Registration service to issue a *registration assertion* for the *impersonated* device. For that purpose we add a new variant of the *assert device registration* operation to the Device Registration API which takes as input both the gateway's (tenant-id, device-id) tuple and the *impersonated* device's (tenant-id, device-id) tuple.\r\n1. Based on the data on record, the Device Registration implementation can determine, if the gateway is allowed to *act on behalf of* the *impersonated* device and issue the token for the *impersonated* device.\r\n1. The adapter can then proceed as usual, i.e. forward the data including the token to Hono Messaging.\r\n\r\nThis way we could *gradually* introduce support for this kind of gateway operation by \r\n1.
