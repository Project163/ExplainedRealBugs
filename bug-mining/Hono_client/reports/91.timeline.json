On Docker Swarm this might happen because the service will be resolvable via DNS as soon as Docker has started the container (I believe). On Kubernetes it will be resolvable only once the configured readiness check succeeds. Have you configured a readiness check? In general, though, the verticle implementing the service as well as the endpoint implementation that handles requests, are started before the AMQP listener is bound. So I would assume that once a client can actually connect to the Auth Server's AMQP port, a SASL handshake should be possible.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to see the log output of the Auth Server at the time the client tries to connect.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/384976957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/385384475","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/605#issuecomment-385384475","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/605","id":385384475,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTM4NDQ3NQ==","user":{"login":"DanielMaier-BSI","id":9269795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNjk3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9269795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielMaier-BSI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-30T12:29:51Z","updated_at":"2018-04-30T13:47:08Z","body":"Here are the full logs of hono auth: [hono-auth.log](https://github.com/eclipse/hono/files/1960440/hono-auth.log)\r\n\r\nWe have set readiness check on hono auth to check for TCP port 5672.

Re-trying the connection does not make much sense in this case because the credentials will remain invalid, thus trapping the client in an endless loop of (futile) re-connect attempts.\r\n\r\nThe vertx-proton SASL client currently provides no means to determine the root cause of a failed SASL handshake, e.g. an internal problem with accessing the backend store (a DB or Hono Auth). Whenever a handshake fails, the client assumes that it is because of bad credentials.\r\n\r\nSo, what can we do? We could either reinstate the original behavior of the HonoClient to always try to re-connect, regardless of the reason for failure. Or your client code could handle the ClientErrorException with the 401 code and try to connect again.\r\n\r\nIn the long run it would probably make sense to create a PR in vertx-proton to allow clients to access the outcome of a SASL handshake in order to determine the root cause (bad credentials vs. system problem) and handle them
