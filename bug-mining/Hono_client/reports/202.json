current `DeviceConnectionClientImpl` that is part of Hono's client module connects to a Device Connection service implementation using AMQP 1.0.\r\nThe Device Connection service implementation that ships with Hono uses an Infinispan data gri for storing the device connection information. Hono's standard protocol adapters could also connect directly to the data grid in order to read/write the connection info, thus skipping the Device Connection service and saving a network hop and protocol translation.
