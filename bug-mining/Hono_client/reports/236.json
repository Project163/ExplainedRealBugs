current Command & Control implementation uses tenant scoped `command/[tenantId]` links to initially receive commands from a downstream application. After having received a command message on that link, the protocol adapter instance that the command target device is connected to is being identified and the command is sent/routed to that adapter instance.\r\n\r\nCurrently, each adapter supports these tenant-scoped links and the corresponding routing logic.\r\n\r\nThis means added complexity for protocol adapter implementations and makes command processing also somewhat unintuitive (a command may be received first by an AMQP adapter and then routed to an MQTT adapter for example).\r\nIt also means that potential issues in a custom protocol adapter could have consequences for commands directed at one of the standard Hono protocol adapters (if these command messages are received by the custom protocol adapter first).\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the idea of introducing a separate component that will first receive **all** command messages and then route them to the appropriate protocol adapter instance.\r\nSuch a `CommandRouting` component could then include also the implementation of the current `DeviceConnectionService`. That means that the `CommandRouting` implementation has the service to identify the target protocol adapter instance of a command message right inside its own component. Thinking further along this line, we can just as well replace the `DeviceConnectionService` with the `CommandRouting` service.\r\n\r\nOperations of the new `CommandRouting` service (to be used by the protocol adapters):\r\n- `setLastKnownGatewayForDevice(tenant, device, gateway)`\r\n- `registerCommandConsumer(tenant, device, consumerId, lifespan)`\r\n- `unregisterCommandConsumer(tenant, device, consumerId)`\r\n\r\n(~~`consumerId` here means the same as what was called `adapterInstanceId` in the *DeviceConnectionAPI*; `adapterInstanceId` was a bit misleading, as there are usually multiple such consumers per adapter instance, corresponding to the number of vert.x verticle instances~~ EDIT: using `adapterInstanceId` is probably more appropriate since we want to keep the number of related resources (e.g. Kafka topics) low. That requires mapping incoming commands to the vert.x verticles (via vert.x event bus), though.)\r\n\r\nFor #1276, this method will probably be needed as well:\r\n- `registerCommandConsumer(tenant, device, correlationId, consumerId, lifespan)`\r\n\r\nThe `AdapterInstancesLivenessService` (#2028) will then also be incorporated into the `CommandRouting` service. For that, an additional, optional operation could be added:\r\n- `ping(consumerId)`\r\n\r\nThis would then be used by custom protocol adapters that are not in the same kubernetes cluster as the other adapters and the `CommandRouting` component.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2029/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
