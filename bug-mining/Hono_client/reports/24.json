Metrics can be reported to services understanding the graphite format.\r\nBetter support for integration with existing device registry and identity management systems by means of refactoring of Hono server into three micro-services (see Architectural Changes section).\r\nIntroduced a set of base classes for implementing services in general and services implemening Device Registration and Authentication API in particular.\r\nSupport Kubernetes as a deployment platform.\r\nOverall improvement of resilience in context of connection failures.\r\nJMeter plugin for load tests, which includes samplers for a Hono sender (acts as an adapter) and a Hono receiver (acts as a solution/application). Also a sample plan is provided.\r\nBug fixes.","creator":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":20,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-03-30T13:45:19Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T07:52:38Z","due_on":"2017-07-03T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-07-03T17:24:56Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-02T12:49:09Z","updated_at":"2017-05-02T14:05:10Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T14:05:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"The patterns discussed and established by the Credentials API, e.g. using the standard `subject` property instead of the `action` application-property, need to be incorporated into the Device Registration API.","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
