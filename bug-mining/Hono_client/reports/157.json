Users are free to choose `${reply_id}`. If an application wants to receive all responses of one tenant, hono docs recommend to use an arbitrary (short) string as `${reply_id}` without `${device_id}` and to keep the receiver link open. \r\n\r\nHowever, protocol adapters use a very similar addressing scheme to receive commands from applications in the form of `control/${tenant_id}/${device_id}`. If `${device_id}` == `${reply_id}` we now have two competing receiver links and messaging network can not distinguish if a message should be sent to protocol adapter or to the application.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution would be to change addressing scheme for responses to \r\n`response/${tenant_id}/${reply_id}`. Of course this would require an API change.\r\n\r\nWDYT?","closed_by":{"login":"DanielMaier-BSI","id":9269795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNjk3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9269795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielMaier-BSI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMaier-BSI/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1073/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
