Motivation:\r\n1. It is always good to have as little dependencies as possible\r\n2. Spring framework is not really needed. The only uses are:\r\n  -  SpringUtils.isEmpty() which could be easily replaced with something like:\r\n`public boolean isEmpty(String str) {`\r\n` return str == null || str.length() == 0; // or str == null || str.isEmpty()`\r\n` }`\r\n Note that SpringUtils.isEmpty() checks objects (not strings only) but Hono client uses it only for strings (as far as I understand).\r\n  - For Cache manager API which is used to hold named caches. This could be easily replaced (if I'm not missing something) with a lightweight abstraction like:\r\n ` interface  CacheManager {`\r\n `   Cache getCache(String name);`\r\n ` }`\r\n ` interface Cache<K, V> {`\r\n `    void put(K key, V value);`\r\n `    V get(K key);`\r\n `    void evict(K key); // or invalidate `\r\n ` }`\r\n   This could be instantiated wrapping Spring cache manger or other cache implementation, e.g. Guava cache. If you do that you will support easier integration of other caches (not Spring only) and it will be a benefit for the users.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
