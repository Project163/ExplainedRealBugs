#356 we have decided to prefer *AT_LEAST_ONCE* delivery for telemetry as well, in order to improve end to end flow control. This should be changed to *AT_LEAST_ONCE*.\r\n\r\nChanging this will have an impact on the MQTT adapter, though, because the MQTT adapter currently waits for messages to be settled, before considering a message being successfully processed. For events this is the right thing to do. However, when changing delivery semantics for `TelemetrySenderImpl`, this will result in unwanted delays when forwarding telemetry messages because the messages will no longer be sent pre-settled.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/443/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
