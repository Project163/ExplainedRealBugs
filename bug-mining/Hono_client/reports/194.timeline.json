In the second step, the device connects for which there are no credentials and no registration in the device registry. Both are created. On subsequent connections of the device, the data is stored in the Device Registry and the authentication process is the same as always.\r\n\r\nThe first step is pretty straight forward because you only need to add a CA certificate as trust anchor. One thing is IMHO still to do here:  \r\nThe tenant configuration should be extended by a property that allows you to grant and deny permission to each trust anchor to use it for JiT provisioning.\r\n\r\n## API changes \r\n\r\nFor triggering the device provisioning by the Protocol Adapter (PA) in the second step I see several options that I would like to discuss:\r\n\r\n1. Following the current pattern for APIs in Hono, we add another API. This could be called \"Provisioning API\" and offer an operation \"provision\" to which the information from the client certificate is sent.\r\n2. Alternatively we can try to use the existing \"Get\" operation of the Credentials API to create credentials \"Just in Time\" if none are found in the Device Registry and the tenant configuration allows JiT provisioning.\r\n3. One option that lies between the first two alternatives would be to add the new (optional) operation \"provision\" to the Credentials API.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of Option 1 is that this operation could easily be offered by other components and systems, requiring only a configuration change on the PA from Hono's point of view. This would certainly be the most flexible option, but we would have another API with only one operation.\r\n\r\nOption 2 would be fully transparent for the PA. The advantage that we don't have to change anything there, comes with the disadvantage that the PA doesn't \"know\" about it and can't react with a larger timeout to a longer duration of the provisioning process. In addition, the registration information is implicitly generated when another API is called. This is not obvious and makes it difficult to understand Hono. This would also be a practical problem if (in the future) a PA would call the Registration API *before* the Credentials API.\r\n\r\nOption 3 has the advantage over option 2 of being clearer in the communication with the PA, since the PA must explicitly initiate the process. It shares the problem with option 2 that the credentials API also generates the registration information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tenant-ID and Device-ID\r\n\r\nIf we use JiT Provisioning only for client certificate-based authentication, the device does not need to know either Tenant-ID or Device-ID. Therefore, the Device-ID can easily be generated during JiT Provisioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Integration with External Systems\r\n\r\nWe should assume that in productive deployments external systems have to be addressed during the provisioning process. Option 1 offers the most flexible support for such a use case. There, any system could offer the API instead of the support having to be built into and delegated from the Device Registry.\r\n\r\nIf you think of the Eclipse Packages project and look for example at the joint use of Hono and Ditto an additional feature would be required.\r\nTo configure a \"Thing\" in Ditto you need a set of information like Policies, Features, Attributes. For this it would make sense to save a \"Template\" for the creation of the \"Thing\" together with the CA certificate during the Tenant configuration. The template should contain variables which are then filled with data from the client certificate during device provisioning.\r\nIn addition to Ditto, other components might also benefit from this feature (possibly it can also be used in Hono for the registration information).\r\nThe question is whether we want to address this in this issue ( it would need to be supported by the Hono Device Registry) or whether the problem should be delegated to the Packages project.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/547900118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"b-abel","id":7031135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzExMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7031135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel","html_url":"https://github.com/b-abel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/b-abel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/547913052","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1296#issuecomment-547913052","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1296","id":547913052,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzkxMzA1Mg==","user":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T13:50:37Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T13:50:37Z","body":"@b-abel thanks for laying out the options.

An adapter will invoke the Credentials service's *get* operation to determine the device ID based on the auth ID (the client certificate's subject DN in this case). If the registry supports JiT provisioning in its *get*operation, then everything is fine and from the adapter's point of view this looks just like the device had already been provisioned.\r\n\r\nSo let's assume that the adapters *always* try to *get* credentials first. If the *get* fails (404) then the adapter could still invoke a separate API operation, either using a dedicated *Provisioning* API or another operation on the Credentials API. This way we could *gradually* introduce the feature in custom device registry implementations first and later add support for configuring protocol adapters with an (optional) provisioning endpoint which they can invoke to register devices on the fly if the *get* operation on Credentials failed and the Tenant is configured to support JiT provisioning.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to Option 1 and 3 we could even simply define the payload of a *Hono provisioning message* and support configuration of an HTTP endpoint per tenant which the adapters POST the provisioning message to.\r\n\r\n> To configure a \"Thing\" in Ditto you need a set of information like Policies, Features, Attributes.

What is your opinion to this proposal?\r\n> \r\n> > Why not store the template for JiT provisioning of devices in Ditto itself? FMPOV we only need to notify Ditto about the fact that we have provisioned a device for a particular tenant on the fly. The creation of the policy, features etc for the device is then the responsibility of Ditto. There is no need to store this information in Hono, or is there?\r\n\r\nAs Ditto I would assume to handle a special Hono message (e.g. via another defined content-type) whenever a device was just-in-time-provisioned.\r\n\r\nI see three options where to \"put\" more metadata about the device creation:\r\n* let the Hono tenant define arbitrary data to send along with those JiT messages\r\n   * that way he would be free to configure additional information for all northbound applications in those messages\r\n* let Ditto define that information\r\n   * could be part of the configured \"connection\" to Hono and a special \"payload mapping\"\r\n* let a provisioning API in front of Hono/Ditto hold that information\r\n   * this would have to be invoked for JiT connected devices (causing a potentially strange call circularity)\r\n   * downside from that is that this API would need to have a persistence then\r\n\r\nNo matter where it is done, which data would be \"applied\" could be based on a \"device-id\" pattern\r\n* e.g. all device ids matching a pattern <xyz> could get a \"device type\" and a policyId (or similar authorization information) assigned\r\n\r\nMy gut feeling is that when specifying such data only in Ditto, some important information of the newly connected device may be lost in the \"JiT message\". For example when not only the device-id is relevant for determining which JiT message data to send but other meta-data which is only available at a device-connectivity layer.\r\n\r\nDon't you see that other systems than Ditto would benefit from more JiT provisioning information?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/547998683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thjaeckle","id":1331526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzE1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1331526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle","html_url":"https://github.com/thjaeckle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2756772336,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1Njc3MjMzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2756772336","actor":{"login":"thjaeckle","id":1331526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzE1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1331526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle","html_url":"https://github.com/thjaeckle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T16:38:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2756772338,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTY3NzIzMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2756772338","actor":{"login":"thjaeckle","id":1331526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzE1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1331526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle","html_url":"https://github.com/thjaeckle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thjaeckle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T16:38:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
