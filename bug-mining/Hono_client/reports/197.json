of #1673:\r\n\r\nAs implemented for #1673, the connection check in the HonoConnectionImpl class (`checkConnected` method) now waits for an ongoing connection attempt to finish.\r\nIt is implemented in such a way that this wait period spans across multiple reconnect attempts.\r\n\r\nIf the configured number of reconnect attempts is not limited (which is the default), there is no timeout mechanism currently in place for the `checkConnected` method.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that in case that all device registry instances become unavailable, the first telemetry/event request will _not_ time out. (Subsequent requests will time out, internally producing an \"already trying to create a client for ..\" error.)\r\n\r\nTo solve this, I suggest letting `checkConnected` wait at most the configured `connect timeout` period (configured in ClientConfigProperties).\r\n(An alternative would be to let `checkConnected` only wait for _one_ reconnect attempt. But in practise, upon shutting down of one device registry instance, there could be some quickly coming \"connection refused\" errors for the reconnect attempts before another device registry instance is targeted, therefore doing multiple reconnect attempts would be better.)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
