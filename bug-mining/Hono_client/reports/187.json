#930 support has been added for command messages to be redirected to the current gateway that the target device is connected to.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the MQTT adapter, this means:\r\n- an authenticated gateway will subscribe for commands (not for a particular device but for all devices using that gateway),\r\n- a northbound application will send a command to a particular device (not knowing its gateway id),\r\n- the protocol adapter will determine the last known gateway for that device and publish the command to it.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing here is that the topic used when publishing the command to the gateway doesn't contain the original device id. The topic currently looks just like this: `command///req/xyz/light`. Instead, the device id should be set in there (e.g. `command//4712/req/xyz/light`) so that the gateway can properly handle the command.\r\n\r\nAlso, documenation for that scenario is missing still.","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
