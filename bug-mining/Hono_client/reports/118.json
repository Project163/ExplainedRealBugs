a command sent by an application waits for a response sent by the device to become successful.\r\n\r\nSince some devices are just not capable of ever sending a response, we need an additional pattern for commands without a response:\r\n\r\n- the application should be able to signal that there is no response expected (in this case no receiver link for a response would be opened at all). \r\n- on the AMQP 1.0 message level this probably is best handled by a missing `reply-to`.\r\n- on the API level there must be some extension implemented that lets the application control that the command is to be considered \"one-way\".\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sysexcontrol","id":24588266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTg4MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24588266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol","html_url":"https://github.com/sysexcontrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/669/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/669/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
