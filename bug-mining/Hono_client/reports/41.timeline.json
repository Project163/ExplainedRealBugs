have a look at this issue.

IMO this creates unnecessary state. I would prefer an approach like ExecutorService or vertx NetClient that are no longer usable after shutdown()/close(). \r\n- Do we also need to cleanup active* Maps on shutdown?\r\n- Also HonoClient gets connection only when connection establishment was successful, i.e. we can not stop NetClient re-connect attempts on shutdown().
