for fixing this:\r\n\r\n#### A: If reconnect happened on different adapter/verticle instance\r\nUpon disconnect, when de-registering the command consumer, the command handling adapter instance mapping gets removed.\r\nAs there is already a new mapping (from the reconnect/re-subscribe) with a different instance id, this operation will return a 412 (precondition failed). In that case the \"disconnectedTtdEvent\" shall not get sent.\r\n\r\n#### B: If reconnect happened on same adapter/verticle instance\r\nWhen the device reconnects and again subscribes for commands, the existing subscriptions for the device id, *across all MQTT connections*, handled by the verticle, are checked for an already existing subscription with the same device id. If such a subscription is found, it gets disassociated from the (old) connection and the command handler gets removed, causing a \"disconnectedTtdEvent\" to be sent. The following re-subscribe action will register a new command consumer and send the \"connectedTtdEvent\". The later disconnect after the keepAlive timeout will have no effect.\r\nThis of course means that there can only be one command subscription for the same device at the same time. But that is effectively already the case anyway, since the latest command subscription overwrites a previous one in case of different protocol adapter or verticle instances being involved.\r\nEDIT: the fix for case B can be simplified by adapting the behaviour when de-registering the obsolete command consumer. When noticing that the local command handler has already been replaced, the further handling (also removing the commandHandlingAdapterInstance mapping) gets skipped.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/707301860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/707663440","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2244#issuecomment-707663440","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2244","id":707663440,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNzY2MzQ0MA==","user":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-13T11:00:19Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T11:00:19Z","body":"@calohmn

https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/concepts/connection-events/ and https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/api/event/#connection-event Hono defines connect/disconnect events. This could (should be able to) be used for maintaining connection status for devices that connects with protocols supporting long living connections (e.g. MQTT, AMQP, GS Adapter). \r\n\r\nHowever, generally the adapters are assumed to scale & be fault tolerant- i.e. to run on multiple hosts. Then how a backend app is supposed to maintain online state. Suppose we have the following flow:\t\r\n1. device connects to node1 -> send connected event -> backend app make status: online\r\n2. connection drop but node1 doesn't have notification (wait for timeout), or understand after some time), - for instance GS Adapter users http for handing connection.\r\n3. device connects again -> this time to node2 -> send connect event -> backend app make status: online -> no change\r\n4. node1 understands (possibly after a timeout) that connection is dead -> send disconnect event -> backend app make status: offline\r\n5. now device is connected but it's status is offline\r\n\r\nHow do you solve this issue for standard MQTT/AMQP adapters of that kind?\r\nWouldn't be better to specify field (along with source) that will hold the node (e.g. node). Then the backend app may keep who notified for last connection and update only if receive disconnect from that node? \r\nOr you could change source semantic to be not the adapter name but node id or
