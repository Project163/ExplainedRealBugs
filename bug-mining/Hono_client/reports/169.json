handling of the *reconnect interval* concerning AMQP connections between Hono components should be improved.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when for example the connection between a protocol adapter and the device registry fails or is closed, the re-connect attempt happens only after 500ms (that is the DEFAULT_RECONNECT_INTERVAL_MILLIS = 500).\r\n\r\nI guess this was introduced for the scenario that the device registry is indeed unavailable and for example currently being (re)started, so that an immediately-after re-connect attempt would probably fail.\r\n\r\nBut, there are other scenarios:\r\n- The device registry could be deployed with multiple instances (Kubernetes pods) and even if one instance is currently not responding, the next connection attempt could reach another, fully available instance.\r\n- The device registry could have actively closed the connection with a \"access token expired\" response, meaning there is no reason to wait for a re-connect attempt.\r\n\r\nIMHO, these two scenarios are quite common, therefore we should introduce a way to handle reconnects where there isn't such a long delay before doing the first retry.\r\n\r\nSuggested in the mailinglist discussion on this was to use an increasing timeout, starting with zero, up to a maximum:\r\n````\r\nminDelay: 0\r\nmaxDelay: 1000\r\nincrement: 100\r\n````\r\nOn connect, reset relay to \"min\". On connection failure increment the delay if it is below \"max\".","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
