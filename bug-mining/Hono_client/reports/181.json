get the following error in DelegatedCommandSender very frequently in our automated system tests (quote from tracing)\r\n\r\n`{\r\n  \"key\": \"error.object\",\r\n  \"type\": \"string\",\r\n  \"value\": \"org.eclipse.hono.client.ServerErrorException: peer did not settle message, failing delivery\"\r\n}`\r\n\r\naccording log statement:\r\n\r\n`peer did not settle message [message ID: DelegatedCommandSenderImpl-304, remote state: Rejected], failing delivery`\r\n\r\nOur test does the following:\r\n- Create new tenant\r\n- Create new device\r\n- Device connects to MQTT adapter\r\n- Device subscribes to command and control topic\r\n- Test waits for event that signals device is ready to receive commands\r\n- Test sends command to device\r\n- Test verifies if command was received by device\r\n\r\nThis sequence runs multiple times for the same device and we have multiple MQTT adapter instances running, i.e it is very likely that device is connected to different adapters during tests.\r\n\r\nIf we add a 1 second sleep between receiving event that signals device is ready to receive commands and sending of the command we do not get this error.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, can this be related to some timing issue in hono, or is it more likely that this is related to our messaging infrastructure?","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
