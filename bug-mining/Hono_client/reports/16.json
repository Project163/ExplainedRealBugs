current TelemetrySenderImpl seems to work fine for adapter where the attached link is always on telemetry/TENANT_ID (defined by the TELEMETRY_ADDRESS_TEMPLATE) where the adapter is authorized by Hono.\n\nWe know that without an adapter in the middle, a device should send data only with its deviceid ... so it attaches to telemetry/TENANT_ID/DEVICE_ID in order to be authorized.\n\nWe should support that in TelemetrySenderImpl providing a createSender overload with the additional paramater \"deviceid\" using a different template like telemetry/%s/%s.\n\nWDYT
