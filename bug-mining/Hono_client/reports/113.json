need to supervise the creation of links in the HonoClient by adding a timer that is failing the creation if it was not completed in the given time frame.\r\n\r\nThis addresses following problems:\r\n- a remote peer could just not answer the creation of a receiver link (letting the creation of a link pair stay undefined forever). The timer would remove all link artifacts and lets the creation fail cleanly.\r\n- the creation lock would not timeout itself, but be based on a Boolean (again). Since the creation fails, the failure code being triggered can remove the Boolean lock and thus trigger the next attempt to create the links (instead of hanging forever as seen once in #819 ).\r\n\r\nA well elaborated discussion of the technical details for this issue can be found in the discussions for the commit 9594cf50927569ff145704645eda6e54464e2aed.","closed_by":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
