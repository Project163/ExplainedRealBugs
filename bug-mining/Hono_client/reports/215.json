This leads to a stale `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry concerning the device in the Device Connection Service.\r\n\r\nNow, for all subsequent command subscriptions only done by the gateway of the device, there is the issue that the stale `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry will effectively prevent commands from getting delivered to the gateway. This is due to the device-specific `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry getting precedence.\r\n\r\nOnly a subsequent created and removed command subscription for the specific device (not the gateway), where the `removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` method succeeds, will mitigate such a situation.\r\n\r\n---\r\nTo prevent or automatically resolve such a situation, this looks like a straightforward solution:\r\n- Implement a retry mechanism for the `removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` invocation for as long as it fails. \r\n\r\nThat is easy to implement _but_ doesn't necessarily prevent the above problem if the adapter is restarted while the `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry hasn't been successfully removed yet.\r\n\r\nTherefore it looks like we need to implement the following instead (or as well):\r\n\r\n- Let `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entries expire after a certain time and implement periodic refresh requests from the protocol adapter while a subscription is still active.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
