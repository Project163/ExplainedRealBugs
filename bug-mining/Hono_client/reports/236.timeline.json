device, that is normally only interacting via a gateway, has done a `ttd` HTTP request to the Hono HTTP protocol adapter in order to receive a command message.\r\nHaving received a command message, there is some error when invoking the `removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` method in the Device Connection Service, as part of the protocol adapter removing the command subscription. This leads to a stale `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry concerning the device in the Device Connection Service.\r\n\r\nNow, for all subsequent command subscriptions only done by the gateway of the device, there is the issue that the stale `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry will effectively prevent commands from getting delivered to the gateway. This is due to the device-specific `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry getting precedence.\r\n\r\nOnly a subsequent created and removed command subscription for the specific device (not the gateway), where the `removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` method succeeds, will mitigate such a situation.\r\n\r\n---\r\nTo prevent or automatically resolve such a situation, this looks like a straightforward solution:\r\n- Implement a retry mechanism for the `removeCommandHandlingAdapterInstance` invocation for as long as it fails. \r\n\r\nThat is easy to implement _but_ doesn't necessarily prevent the above problem if the adapter is restarted while the `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entry hasn't been successfully removed yet.\r\n\r\nTherefore it looks like we need to implement the following instead (or as well):\r\n\r\n- Let `commandHandlingAdapterInstance` entries expire after a certain time and implement periodic refresh requests from the protocol adapter while a subscription is still active.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3433376789,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzNDMzMzc2Nzg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/3433376789","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-11T09:49:22Z","assignee":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/643321500","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2029#issuecomment-643321500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2029","id":643321500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzMyMTUwMA==","user":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-12T15:03:41Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T20:59:23Z","body":"The architecture and command message flow would look like this then:\r\n![CommandRoutingService](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/891931/84504765-cb212e80-acbc-11ea-889a-8643ed0fbf69.png)\r\n(1) Device subscribes as a command consumer at a protocol adapter.\r\n(2) Protocol adapter invokes `registerCommandConsumer` with device/tenant id and its adapter instance id on the `CommandRouting` service; the `CommandRouting` service stores this mapping from device id to adapter instance id in some (potentially external) key-value datastore (making sure the data can be retrieved from all `CommandRouting` component instances); the `CommandRouting` service makes sure there is a receiver link with the AMQP network on `command/$tenant`.\r\n(3) Northbound application sends command.\r\n(4) `CommandRouting` service receives command, identifies adapter instance id for the device of the command message (by querying key-value datastore mentioned above).\r\n(5) `CommandRouting` service sends command on `command_internal/$adapterInstance`\r\n(6) Protocol adapter receives command on that link and sends command to device/gateway\r\n\r\n----\r\n### Variation:\r\nIf we use Infinispan anyway here (as storage for the mapping data currently still set by `setCommandHandlingAdapterInstance`) and if we let the `CommandRouting` component instances themselves make up the Infinispan cluster (i.e. use an embedded cluster), we could skip routing the command messages via the AMQP messaging network to the adapter instance and instead let the adapter instances open the `command_internal/$adapterInstance` receiver link with the `CommandRouting` component. When using multiple `CommandRouting` instances, a command may then be routed by means of the inter-cluster transport (e.g. vert.x clustered event bus) from one `CommandRouting` instance to the other.\r\nThis would look like this:\r\n![CommandRoutingService_InterCom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/891931/84512725-b054b700-acc8-11ea-89dd-9e1148e34c6c.png)\r\nThe extra step (5) here would be transferring the command message to the actual `CommandRouting` instance to which the target protocol adapter instance has opened its consumer link.\r\n\r\nAdvantage of this variation would be that the command routing would remain inside the Hono Kubernetes cluster (if the AMQP messaging network is external). Disadvantage would maybe be some added complexity for the communication between the `CommandRouting` instances, but when using the vert.x cluster features, this could be quite straightforward.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Timeline:\r\nIntroducing and using the `CommandRouting` service involves the following steps:\r\n1. deprecate the `HotrodBasedDeviceConnectionClient` that lets the protocol adapters connect directly to the Infinispan cluster\r\n2. deprecate the `DeviceConnection` API\r\n3. introduce the `CommandRouting` API and a server/client implementation. The server implementation could also still include the `DeviceConnection` API implementation so it stays backward compatible.\r\n4. Remove `HotrodBasedDeviceConnectionClient`\r\n5. Remove `DeviceConnection` API definition and client/server implementation.\r\n\r\nI think we could do 1. and 2. with Hono 1.3 already, then integrate the new functionality (3) in Hono 1.4. If we stay with the current definition of the Device Connection API as still \"subject to change\" (ie. not following the strict versioning rules, I think we defined that in a recent call), we could also do steps 4. and 5. in Hono 1.4. (Otherwise we could keep Hono 1.4 compatible with older adapters and remove things in 2.0.)\r\n\r\n@ctron, @dejanb, @sophokles73 What do you think (about architecture/variation and timeline)

Instead, **protocol adapters connect directly via AMQP with the CommandRouter**.\r\n\r\nAs one protocol adapter shouldn't have to open connections with *each* CommandRouter instance, it has to be ensured that an incoming command arrives at the very CommandRouter instance that the command target protocol adapter has connected to.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by simply **letting all commands be sent via multicast on the `command/$tenant` address**.\r\nAn incoming command in the CommandRouter will trigger a check with the stored \"device id → consumer id\" mapping to find the target adapter instance consumer. Then: Either the CommandRouter instance has a link to that adapter instance consumer, so that it will forward the command on that link, or it doesn't have such a link, ignoring the command message and relying on the fact that another CommandRouter instance (the one with the matching link) will have forwarded the command message.\r\n\r\n![CommandsAMQP_CommandRouter2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/891931/97592085-90682a80-1a00-11eb-9e71-9da17cdc7b0a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT (2020-11-24): \r\nAs there are potential issues with such a multicast approach for the Kafka implementation (see https://github.com/eclipse/hono/issues/2273#issuecomment-719383866), the plan is now to stick with the 1st option above, forwarding commands on the adapter instance address via the AMQP messaging network.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/718816290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/718849982","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2029#issuecomment-718849982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/2029","id":718849982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxODg0OTk4Mg==","user":{"login":"dejanb","id":141611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTYxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb","html_url":"https://github.com/dejanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T15:58:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T15:58:53Z","body":"Looks good.

whether we should put a `setLastKnownGatewayForDevice` method in there.\r\nThe lastKnownGateway is currently used for deciding to which gateway to forward a command to in case multiple gateways are a possible target. However, if a device only randomly sends telemetry/events, thereby updating the lastKnownGateway information, and if the device switches from one gateway to the other more often, then this information isn't necessarily useful and wouldn't prevent the command from potentially reaching a gateway that the device isn't connected to at that moment.\r\nI think an alternative could be to just forward a command to all available (i.e. connected and subscribed) target gateways.\r\nThe decision on which disposition (accepted, released, rejected) to update the command delivery with, could then be done in the same way [as the Qpid dispatch router does it](https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-dispatch-1.14.0/user-guide/index.html#message-settlement-reliability-message-routing-qdr).

added a PR for a AMQP based API in #2280. \r\n(Even though we might skip the direct AMQP connection from protocol adapter to CommandRouter in favor of the hop back to the AMQP messaging network (see

It's in line with the other Hono internal APIs between adapters and device registry. For HTTP, we would also first have to implement the authentication mechanism in connection to Hono Auth (then token based, I guess).)

For that, the adapter would still use the configuration to access the DeviceConnection service and would use the `ProtocolAdapterCommandConsumerFactoryImpl` (perhaps renamed to \"*Legacy*ProtocolAdapterCommandConsumerFactoryImpl\").\r\n\r\nTo use the new Command Router component, the adapters can be configured with a set of `commandRouter` configuration options (instead of `deviceConnection`), leading to a new CommandConsumerFactory implementation class to be used (by enabling a corresponding bean) - one that targets the Command Router component.\r\n\r\nThe Command Router component might internally still use the Device Connection API, but that's just an implementation detail. In a future Hono version we can then remove the Device Connection API.\r\n\r\n---\r\nOne downside of this approach would be that the protocol adapters can't use the HotRod based client to store the \"device→adapter instance\" mappings in a very efficient manner anymore - instead these mappings get stored via the Command Router component. That would also apply to the \"lastKnownGateway\" entries. But, IMHO the added latency isn't that important when registering consumers. Only the \"lastKnownGateway\" information gets set frequently, so this could add extra load on the Command Router component. But I don't know if that would be a reason to keep the Device Connection API with just the \"lastKnownGateway\" methods. We can still consider removing the \"lastKnownGateway\" usage altogether (see [comment above](https://github.com/eclipse/hono/issues/2029#issuecomment-720992776)).\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/724630163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3982660686,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5ODI2NjA2ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/3982660686","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1b66acf2e9f81f1dd9fef54fbd48b89486106f17","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bosch-io/hono/commits/1b66acf2e9f81f1dd9fef54fbd48b89486106f17","created_at":"2020-11-11T08:14:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3987255206,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5ODcyNTUyMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/3987255206","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1d8242a2d5a330ead9c5f59c3292539023f101cf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/commits/1d8242a2d5a330ead9c5f59c3292539023f101cf","created_at":"2020-11-12T07:45:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3987273685,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5ODcyNzM2ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/3987273685","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type
