there is one Command & Control receiver link *for each device*, opened from the protocol adapter instance to the AMQP network.\r\nThis link is on the address `control/$tenant/$device` (or `control/$tenant/$gateway` respectively).\r\n\r\nIt would be good if we could reduce that potentially large number of links.\r\n\r\nAs proposed by @sophokles73, we could use receiver links for each protocol adapter instance (containing an instance uuid in the address) instead.\r\n\r\nTaking on the example illustration from #930 \r\n![Gateway-Mapper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/891931/58940526-f43de380-8779-11e9-970b-881176c4fc2c.png)\r\nthis means replacing the red `control/$tenant/$gateway` links with just one for each protocol adapter instance, e.g. `control_internal/$tenant/$protocolAdapterUUID`.\r\n\r\nWhenever a device/gateway subscribes to a protocol adapter for receiving Command & Control messages, we will store the mapping of `device/gateway ID -> protocol adapter instance` via the new Device Connection API. We will also make sure there is a receiver link `control_internal/$tenant/$protocolAdapterUUID` on that protocol adapter instance.\r\nUpon receiving a command on the tenant-scoped receiver link, the protocol adapter will query the Device State API to get the corresponding protocol adapter uuid and forward the command message to `control_internal/$tenant/$protocolAdapterUUID`.\r\n\r\n---\r\nConcerning when to implement this:\r\nwe currently have 2 kinds of receiver links in the protocol adapters: \r\n- `control/$tenant` (tenant-scoped link with gateway-mapping feature)\r\n- `control/$tenant/$device` (legacy command link, also used now for forwarding the gateway-mapped commands internally)\r\n\r\nThe 2nd `control/$tenant/$device` link will be made into an only-used-internally kind of link at some point, removing the backwards compatibility for applications to send commands on that link.\r\nWhen we do this, we could change the `control/$tenant/$device` link into the new \r\n `control_internal/$tenant/$protocolAdapterUUID` link. That way, we don't have to deal with 3 kinds of receiver links at the same time.","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
