Hono Devs, \r\n\r\nIn a corporate set up you often want to operate hono as a shared service among different tenants. The tenants in such an environment usually do not share all the same privileges. \r\n\r\nOne could imagine for example the following use cases: \r\n- A tenant is only allowed to use certain adapters (e.q. REST but no MQTT). \r\n- A tenant is only allowed to use a certain bandwidth (rate of events / telemetry) for a specific adapter.\r\n- …\r\n\r\nAs a first step to enable such use cases, I propose to introduce a \"Tenant API\" component in Eclipse Hono. The Tenant API should be designed in an analogous way as for example the Credentials or Device API. This would give it the following features:\r\n- Runs as new independent hono component. \r\n- AMQP 1.0 Interface for CRUD operations to other hono components. \r\n- Data is specified in JSON with the possabillity to store additionall meta data. \r\n- File based default implementation, which just implements the Read operation.\r\n\r\nIn further follow-up stories the adapters could be extended to consider the information from the Tenant API.\r\n\r\nWDYT: Makes such a component sense in the hono environment? If so I would like to\r\n- provide an API draft for the new component\r\n- Implement a file based default implementation\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks Chris","closed_by":{"login":"sysexcontrol","id":24588266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTg4MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24588266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol","html_url":"https://github.com/sysexcontrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/388/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
