northbound application sends a command to a device. The protocol adapter (tried with _MQTT_ and _AMQP_ adapters) sends back a _rejected_ disposition. This information is not cascaded to the northbound application and thereby the application waits until the time out expires.   \r\n\r\n`CommandClient` implementation uses `AbstractRequestResponseClient.sendRequest(Message message, Handler<ProtonDelivery> onUpdated)` to send the AMQP messages. And the delivery state is always received as _accepted_ irrespective of the disposition sent by the protocol adapters.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
