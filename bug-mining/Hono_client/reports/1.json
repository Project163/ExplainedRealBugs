This approach allows to keep versions of our libraries/plugins nicely aligned and also makes it easier to monitor updates in selected dependencies using commands like:\n\n```\nmvn versions:display-property-updates\n```\n\nIf nobody objects I will be happy to introduce BOM and extract properties.\n","closed_by":{"login":"hekonsek","id":822903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek","html_url":"https://github.com/hekonsek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hekonsek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
