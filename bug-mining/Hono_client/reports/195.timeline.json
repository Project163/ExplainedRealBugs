change has been committed. A further note on this:\r\n\r\n> The `preFetchSize` in the `createReceiver` invocation in `DeviceSpecificCommandConsumer` should probably be kept 0 since we don't want automatic credit handling (credits need to be sent manually once the command has been acknowledged by the device, which is potentially done *after* the message handler of the command consumer has finished).\r\n\r\n`preFetchSize` has been set to the initial credits now (thereby enabling automatic credit handling). The manual credit handling (after waiting for command acknowledgement from the device) is not really needed anymore since there is the tenant-scoped `MappingAndDelegatingCommandConsumer` now in between (also having automatic credit handling) meaning that we can't flow an exact device-specific number of credits to the AMQP messaging network anymore anyway. We rather need to make sure that there is not too few credits being provided.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/566489749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
