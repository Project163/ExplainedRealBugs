Metrics can be reported to services understanding the graphite format.\r\nBetter support for integration with existing device registry and identity management systems by means of refactoring of Hono server into three micro-services (see Architectural Changes section).\r\nIntroduced a set of base classes for implementing services in general and services implemening Device Registration and Authentication API in particular.\r\nSupport Kubernetes as a deployment platform.\r\nOverall improvement of resilience in context of connection failures.\r\nJMeter plugin for load tests, which includes samplers for a Hono sender (acts as an adapter) and a Hono receiver (acts as a solution/application). Also a sample plan is provided.\r\nBug fixes.","creator":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":20,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-03-30T13:45:19Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T07:52:38Z","due_on":"2017-07-03T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-07-03T17:24:56Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-05-19T13:44:12Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T12:30:50Z","closed_at":"2017-06-06T12:30:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"While implementing the credentials API it became obvious that there are several common code blocks that are currently mostly doubled.\r\nThis should be improved by introducing sensible abstractions which are used by both (and possible future) API implementations.\r\nThis holds true for the implementation and also the test classes.\r\n\r\nThe common base classes should be introduced directly after the first credentials API version is ready.","closed_by":{"login":"sysexcontrol","id":24588266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTg4MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24588266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol","html_url":"https://github.com/sysexcontrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sysexcontrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
