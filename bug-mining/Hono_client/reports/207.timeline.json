is for #1245:\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #1257, we need a new API to store and retrieve information concerning which gateway acted last on behalf of a given device.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the documentation for such a new API.\r\n\r\nI've called it `Device Connection API`, containing the `Set Last Known Gateway for Device` and `Get Last Known Gateway for Device` operations and using `device_con` as AMQP address prefix.\r\n\r\nThe name `Device State API`, as used beforehand in #1257, would imply that information regarding the state of devices is stored there which is not really the case (it is more about the connections of the devices). The other alternative name of `Connection State API` would point to connection states like \"open\", \"closed\" which is also not a good fit, IMHO.\r\n\r\nThe `Device Connection API` may then also be used to act as a serialization layer for a `ConnectionEventProducer` implementation.\r\n\r\nA further future addition to this API might be a mapping of the gateway/device ID to the instance UUID of the protocol adapter it is connected to (`protocolAdapterForDevice`). See #1272 for that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2394537017,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzOTQ1MzcwMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2394537017","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-06T14:27:33Z","label":{"name":"C&C","color":"2dbc83"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-06T15:04:47Z","updated_at":"2019-06-06T15:04:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1276","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1276/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1276/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1276/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1276","id":453016592,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTMwMTY1OTI=","number":1276,"title":"Add

issue is about a use case where a device sends a request message and expects a corresponding response from a northbound application.\r\n\r\nSuch a scenario can already be implemented with Hono. The device can send a telemetry/event message with a correlation id property/parameter and with a `ttd` parameter (signaling its readiness to receive a command message). The northbound application can send a one-way command message as response, including the given correlation id. Upon receiving the command message, the device can correlate the message to its initial telemetry/event message using the correlation id.\r\n\r\nHowever, such a solution is not very intuitive and requires manual correlation of the messages.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be good to explore the feasibility of adding explicit support for such a communication pattern, including correlation support and matching endpoint names.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1276/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/comments/507726328","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1272#issuecomment-507726328","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1272","id":507726328,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzcyNjMyOA==","user":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-02T15:25:53Z","updated_at":"2019-07-02T15:25:53Z","body":"IMHO

A device that has subscribed to receiving commands on the AMQP adapter.\r\n2. For some reason the AMQP connection fails.\r\n3. The devices opens a new connection to another AMQP adapter instance and again subscribes to receive commans.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the device is not receiving any commands on its new connection.\r\n\r\nOne such case could be:\r\nWhen the device considers its initial connection to the adapter to have failed, the adapter still believes that its connection to the device is alive. Thus, it does not close the command receiver link that it had opened on behalf of the device. Depending on what adapter instance the device re-connects to, the following happens:\r\n1. If the device re-connects to the same instance, then the device's attempt to re-subscribe to commands will fail because the adapter still has such a link open for the device which the adapter still considers working. Any commands sent to the device from an application will be routed to the adapter where delivery of the command will fail because the connection to the device is broken.\r\n2. If the device re-connects to another instance, that instance also opens a command receiver link for the device and now two such links exist and any command sent to the device by an application will either be routed to the initial adapter (where it gets released) or to the new adapter (where delivery will succeed).\r\n\r\nThere are two issues to be addressed FMPOV:\r\n1) Adapters should close a command receiver link they have opened for a device if a command for that device cannot be delivered to the device due to a stale/broken connection. I believe that the adapter can determine this condition when it tries to forward the command to the device.\r\n2) Adapters should have some means to announce to other adapter instances that they have opened a receiver link for a device. This way, other instances of the adapter get a chance to close their (stale) receiver links for the same device.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T11:20:20Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T11:20:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1644","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1644/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1644/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1644/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1644","id":531062603,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MzEwNjI2MDM=","number":1644,"title":"Document

is deployed in such a way that the AMQP and MQTT adapter endpoints are represented each by a loadbalancer with _multiple_ protocol adapter instances behind it.\r\n\r\nImplications for Command&Control:\r\nIn such a setup, gateways initiating multiple subscriptions (via AMQP/MQTT) for commands of *specific* devices must do so over the same AMQP/MQTT connection.\r\nThis should be made clear in the documentation.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nFor now it has to be made sure that command subscriptions related to one specific gateway are handled by the same protocol adapter instance - otherwise there will be 2 concurrent consumer links on the gateway-specific address and commands for a specific device might end up at the wrong instance. Using the same AMQP/MQTT connection ensures that the same adapter instance is used.\r\nWith #1632, using a different connection and arriving at a different adapter instance will lead to the other subscriptions being closed, thereby preventing lost command messages.\r\nWith #1272 (Hono 1.1), the overall link handling regarding command & control shall be changed.

anymore.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-02T11:49:49Z","updated_at":"2019-12-02T11:49:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1645","id":531077279,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MzEwNzcyNzk=","number":1645,"title":"HTTP:

Hono is deployed in such a way that the HTTP adapter endpoint is represented by a loadbalancer with multiple protocol adapter instances behind it.\r\n- a gateway sends multiple, potentially concurrent, event/telemetry messages with a _ttd_ parameter (ie. waiting for a command message) on behalf of a specific device.\r\n\r\nPotential issue:\r\nIf multiple concurrent requests related to the same gateway end up on different protocol adapter instances, multiple command consumer links on the gateway-specific address will be opened on the different instances. This may lead to commands reaching the wrong adapter instance and getting released. \r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFor Hono 1.0.x, the solution is to effectively prevent the creation of the gateway-specific command consumer links when a gateway issues a HTTP `ttd` request on behalf of a specific device.\r\nThat means that the above HTTP requests shall lead to command consumer links being created for the specific device, not the gateway. Furthermore, the HTTP adapter shall always set the last-known-gateway flag to the device itself, not the gateway. This effectively disables the gateway-mapping for commands targeted at the HTTP adapter.\r\nNote that with this, there is the limitation that gateways connected via HTTP can't request commands for _any_ device connected to the gateway. The gateway must always send the `ttd` requests on behalf of a specific device. This should be noted in the documentation.\r\nEDIT: This changed behaviour shall only be enabled for tenants having the new `support-concurrent-gateway-device-command-requests` option set to `true` in the `adapters/ext` field.\r\n\r\nWith Hono 1.1 and #1272 having been implemented, this issue doesn't arise and the above limitation can be removed.\r\n\r\n(See #1644 for the AMQP/MQTT adapter scenario.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2857887956,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyODU3ODg3OTU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2857887956","actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-05T13:51:25Z","assignee":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2857888587,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4NTc4ODg1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2857888587","actor":{"login":"sophokles73","id":5682135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODIxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5682135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73","html_url":"https://github.com/sophokles73","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sophokles73/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-05T13:51:36Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T21:01:09Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T21:01:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1478","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hon

projects in the IoT often use proprietary protocols for connecting devices to the respective backend systems. After such projects are deployed to production it is often hard to change their firmware and switch to a different protocol like MQTT. \r\n\r\nEclipse Hono provides a concept to connect such devices via a custom protocol adapter (see [Implement a Custom Hono HTTP Protocol Adapter](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/dev-guide/custom_http_adapter/)). My understanding is that such a protocol adapter is supposed to be operated by the Eclipse Hono service provider and connects directly to the AMQP 1.0 messaging network. This concept is however not applicable in a setup where a third party deploys and operates the protocol adapter (e.g. due to the fact that the service provider cannot force tenant specific limits in that setup).\r\n\r\nTherefore I think it makes sense to provide support for third party operated protocol adapters in order to connect devices via a proprietary protocol (let's call this a \"third party adapter\" contrary to the \"custom protocol adapter\"). I see the following requirements:\r\n* Third party adapters are scoped to a single tenant\r\n* The third party adapter is authenticating devices and can but doesn’t need to use the device registry for persisting credentials\r\n* As a service provider I have insights in the traffic that is sent by the third party adapter to northbound applications\r\n* As a service provider I'm able to force limits for a customer connecting devices via a third party adapter (e.g. max processed data volume for this tenant)\r\n* Third party adapters can be used in setups where devices connect directly to the third party adapter and where devices connect via a gateway to the third party adapter (e.g. smart home scenario where the smart home gateway connects via a proprietary protocol to the third party adapter)\r\n* Third party adapters can be scaled dynamically, when and how adapters do scale is in the responsibility of the third party adapter provider\r\n* All requirements must be fulfilled by Eclipse Hono and not by the AMQP 1.0 messaging network implementation (just for the sake of completeness as it would be probably possible to fulfill the requirements on the messaging network level)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback to this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1478/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2866752776,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NjY3NTI3NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2866752776","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fa9d4920c84d1831c164a1d038bde7df604461d1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bosch-io/hono/commits/fa9d4920c84d1831c164a1d038bde7df604461d1","created_at":"2019-12-09T15:24:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T15:46:06Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T15:46:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1657","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1657/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1657/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1657/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-hono/hono/pull/1657","id":535016564,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzUwNzg0ODIz","number":1657,"title":"[#1645]

fixes #1645.\r\nThis prevents issues with commands not reaching the correct adapter instance in case of concurrent HTTP requests. \r\nThe solution here is to effectively disable the command gateway mapping for HTTP adapters by:\r\n- always creating a device specific command consumer link (even if a gateway is involved)\r\n- always mapping the `last-known-gateway` to the device id itself, not the gateway.\r\n\r\nThis changed behaviour is only enabled for tenants having the new `support-concurrent-gateway-device-command-requests` option set to `true` in the `adapters/ext` field.\r\n\r\nThis change can probably be reverted again once #1272 is implemented and adapter-specific command consumer links are introduced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/1657/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2866993339,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NjY5OTMzMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2866993339","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1b93f017845352a5fd6b707743307553c14fa9db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bosch-io/hono/commits/1b93f017845352a5fd6b707743307553c14fa9db","created_at":"2019-12-09T16:26:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2877023278,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NzcwMjMyNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2877023278","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"10665abe83a91e6b69a62662e559c052a8015e4a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bosch-io/hono/commits/10665abe83a91e6b69a62662e559c052a8015e4a","created_at":"2019-12-12T08:31:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2877187068,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4NzcxODcwNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2877187068","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0c03ad6fc2a04d5d5c14bc2e55d6c799535e7556","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bosch-io/hono/commits/0c03ad6fc2a04d5d5c14bc2e55d6c799535e7556","created_at":"2019-12-12T09:26:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2877479980,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4Nzc0Nzk5ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-hono/hono/issues/events/2877479980","actor":{"login":"calohmn","id":891931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/891931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn","html_url":"https://github.com/calohmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calohmn
