+     <answer>
+       <p>
+         The <code>site.xml</code> that can be deployed alongside parent POMs was originally attached to the project in such a
+         way that the GPG Plugin could not get a hold of it. To enable signing of the site descriptor, you need to update to
+         Maven Site Plugin 2.1.1+ which contains the required fix (see also
+         <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSITE-478">MSITE-478</a>).
