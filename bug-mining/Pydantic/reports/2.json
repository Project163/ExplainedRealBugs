tried to use schema creation and it's awesome, but I found, I think, bug with optional fields.\r\n\r\nHere is my model:\r\n```\r\nfrom typing import Optional\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass TestModel(BaseModel):\r\n    foo: Optional[int] = None\r\n\r\nprint(TestModel.schema_json(indent=2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test_pydantic_schema.py\", line 9, in <module>\r\n    print(TestModel.schema_json(indent=2))\r\n  File \"/pydantic/pydantic/main.py\", line 288, in schema_json\r\n    return json.dumps(cls.schema(by_alias=by_alias), default=pydantic_encoder, **dumps_kwargs)\r\n  File \"/pydantic/pydantic/main.py\", line 278, in schema\r\n    s['properties'] = {f.alias: f.schema(by_alias)

typing import Union\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass TestModel(BaseModel):\r\n    foo: Union[str, int]\r\n\r\nprint(TestModel.schema_json(indent=2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think `pydantic` should cover cases like this, I don't know what is the best way to solve issue with `Optional`, but in case of `Union` `oneOf` or `anyOf` rule can be used
