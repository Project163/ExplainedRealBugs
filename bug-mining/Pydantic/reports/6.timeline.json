derived from https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/275\r\n\r\nCurrently `BaseSettings` defaults to looking for env variables in uppercase. This issue is a feature proposal to make this behaviour configurable.\r\n\r\nThe current workaround is to use the settings config class to set up aliases, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n class S(pydantic.BaseSettings):\r\n      test:str\r\n\r\n      class Config:\r\n          fields = dict(test=dict(alias=\"test\"))\r\n```\r\nHowever this is verbose and onerous to do (for the developer), if there are many such env vars.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the developer could do something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n class S(pydantic.BaseSettings):\r\n      class Config:\r\n          letter_case = \"lower\" # or:  \"upper\" | \"any\"\r\n\r\n      test:str\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout this concern raised for case insensitive option https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/275#issuecomment-430336275.\r\n\r\n* we could log a warning or raise an error at a certain configurable threshold of\r\n    * env var count\r\n    * or perhaps based on measured processing time exceeding configurable budget (e.g. 1ms)\r\n* we could cache the calculation of `env2` (but probably the entire settings result would just be cached by the app)\r\n* the env prefix could help reduce the amount of work needed to do","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jasonkuhrt","id":284476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDQ3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/284476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonkuhrt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkuhrt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-20T01:55:16Z","updated_at":"2018-10-20T01:55:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/282","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/282/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/282/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/282/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/282","id":372161488,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI0NDQ0Njgy","number":282,"title":"fix:
