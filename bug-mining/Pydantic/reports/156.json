Most of the time this is not a problem: comparing instances and .dict() outputs do not depend on the field order. But for JSON export, it does matter.\r\n\r\nShouldn't the JSON export from an instance generated via .construct() with pre-validated input be identical to the JSON export of a properly validated instance?\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Foo(BaseModel):\r\n    a: int\r\n    b: int = 42\r\n    c: float\r\n\r\n\r\ninstance = Foo(a=1, c=3.14)  # Correct field order\r\ninstance_construct = Foo.construct(**instance.dict())  # Incorrect field order\r\n\r\nprint(instance)            # Output: a=1 b=42 c=3.14\r\nprint(instance_construct)  # Output: b=42 a=1 c=3.14\r\n\r\nprint(instance.json())            # Output: {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 42, \"c\": 3.14}\r\nprint(instance_construct.json())  # Output: {\"b\": 42, \"a\": 1, \"c\": 3.14}\r\n\r\nassert instance == instance_construct  # No Error\r\nassert instance.dict() == instance_construct.dict()  # No Error\r\nassert instance.json() == instance_construct.json()  # AssertionError\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
