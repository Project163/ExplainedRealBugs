@michael0liver thanks for reporting\r\n\r\nThere are three main ways\r\n- handle it in your code thanks to a `# type: ignore` or better with a `if TYPE_CHECKING` condition\r\n- handle the custom types directly in _pydantic_ code\r\n- handle the custom types in _pydantic_ `mypy` plugin\r\n\r\nI just opened a PR with the second solution. You can add [this](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/pull/2099/files#diff-f7a381c0918da7ec905bfbe6aff2ccc72c2d0fd6da0dd3011ef1da892e42d57aR550) directly in your code\r\n```python\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseSettings\r\n\r\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\r\n    from typing import Union\r\n    DirectoryPath = Union[str, Path]\r\nelse:\r\n    from pydantic import DirectoryPath\r\n```\r\n\r\n or add a `# type: ignore` in the meantime\r\n```python\r\nclass Config(BaseSettings):\r\n    CONTENT_DIR: DirectoryPath = BASE_DIR / \"content\"  # type: ignore\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope it
