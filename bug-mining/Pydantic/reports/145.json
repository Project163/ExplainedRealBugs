Example:\r\n```\r\nimport pydantic.generics\r\nimport typing\r\n\r\nT = typing.TypeVar(\"T\")\r\n\r\nclass ResponseModel(pydantic.generics.GenericModel, typing.Generic[T]):\r\n    data: List[T]\r\n\r\nclass PaginatedResponseModel(ResponseModel[T]):\r\n    total_count: int\r\n\r\nConcreteModel = PaginatedReponseModel[dict] # TypeError: Cannot parameterize a concrete instantiation of a generic model\r\n\r\n```\r\n`PaginatedReponseModel` is erroneously considered \"concrete\" even though type variables are used as parameters, and not concrete types.\r\nIt seems GenericModel.__class_getitem__ does not check if any parameters are `TypeVar`, like `typing.Generic` does. \r\n\r\nTo support generic subclasses, `__class_getitem__` should check if all of the parameters are fully concrete type(i.e. any of them are `typing.TypeVar`s, or any of them are generic types that have non-concrete type parameters). If not, a concrete model should not be created.\r\n\r\nI would consider this a bug since it does not follow the behavior of other `typing.Generic` usages, but it could also be a feature request.\r\n\r\nPlease complete:\r\n* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.1\r\n* Python version `import sys; print(sys.version)`: 3.7.1 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:21:55) \r\n[GCC 8.2.0]\r\n* Pydantic version `import pydantic; print(pydantic.VERSION)`: `1.0`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/947/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
