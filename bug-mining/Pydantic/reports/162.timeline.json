Change Summary\r\n\r\nUpdate mkdocs extensions to fix local syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\nRan into #2400 as well.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/\r\nthe pymdownx.highlight extension supersedes the CodeHilite extension, \r\nthe \"extra\" extension was still causing the syntax highlighting to disappear (it would show up when taking it out).\r\nBut apparently, there's https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/extra/ which also replaces the \"extra\" extension, and also fixed the syntax highlighting in combination with pymdownx.highlight.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\nFixed #2400 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes
