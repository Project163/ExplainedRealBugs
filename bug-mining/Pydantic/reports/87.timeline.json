Change Summary\r\n\r\nRoughly halve the time to import pydantic, see #1127 for discussion.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* `dataclasses` is only imported when used\r\n* three regexes `url_regex`, `ascii_domain_regex` and `int_domain_regex` in `network.py` now only compiled when used. Thus `url_regex` etc. are now accessible as a function `url_regex()`\r\n* `email_validator` is only imported when it's used.\r\n* `pydantic.VERSION` is no longer a `StrictVersion`, just a standard str\r\n* `version_info` will only import `platform` and `sys` when it's called\r\n* `Color` regexes are not compiled until used.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\nfix #1127 and also fix #1039\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [x] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at 100%\r\n* [ ] ~~Documentation reflects the changes where applicable~~\r\n* [x]

convenient to be able to use `debug()` as if it were a builtin function, but importing `devtools` directly in `sitecustomize.py` is a pretty significant performance hit for every invocation of python that doesn't use `debug()`.  Specifically, this import takes 100-200 ms, which is a noticeable delay for interactive sessions and short-running scripts:\r\n\r\n    $ python -X importtime -c 'import devtools'\r\n\r\nWhile it would probably be possible to make `devtools` faster to import, the best solution is simply to avoid importing `devtools` unless it will be used.  It took me a while to figure out how to do this, but in the end the code is pretty clear and succinct, and I think it will be useful to others:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# sitecustomize.py\r\nclass lazy_debug:\r\n    @property\r\n    def __call__(self):\r\n        from devtools import debug\r\n        return debug\r\n\r\n__builtins__['debug'] = lazy_debug()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the `README` file to include the above snippet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samuelcolvin/python-devtools/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samuelcolvin/python-devtools/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-08T11:25:16Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T11:25:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4734","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4734/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4734/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4734/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/4734","id":1439519275,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBWBCuM5CY0WQ","number":4734,"title":"Fix
