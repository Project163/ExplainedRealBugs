It is my first pull request to the project which I really, really appreciate :) The problem is when characters in ```env_prefix``` and ```env_nested_delimiter``` match, it occurs an unexpected behaviour as the initial splitting was wrong in this case.\r\n\r\nI added a new ```env_prefix``` field to ```EnvSettingsSource``` to fix the issue without parsing ```ModelField``` which I think can create a little \"code mess\".\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short summary of the changes. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\nfix #3807\r\n\r\n<!-- Are there any issues opened that will be resolved by merging this change? -->\r\n<!-- WARNING: please use \"fix #123\" style references so the issue is closed when this PR is merged. -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [x] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at 100%\r\n* [x] `changes/<pull request or issue id>-<github username>.md` file added describing change\r\n  (see [changes/README.md](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/master/changes/README.md) for details)\r\n* [x] My PR is ready to review, **please add a comment including the phrase \"please review\" to assign reviewers**\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3975/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7170534736,"node_id":"CE_lADOBWBCuM5DfZzxzwAAAAGrZa1Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/7170534736","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-11T10:35:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7170534786,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBWBCuM5DfZzxzwAAAAGrZa2C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/7170534786","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6650edfe8f23aecf40fb58c0243a0be8a8e32a7c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/commits/6650edfe8f23aecf40fb58c0243a0be8a8e32a7c","created_at":"2022-08-11T10:35:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
