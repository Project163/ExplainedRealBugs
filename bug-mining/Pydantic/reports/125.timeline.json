I commit to one of:\r\n    * Read open issues with questions until I find 2 issues where I can help someone and add a comment to help there.\r\n    * I already hit the \"watch\" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.\r\n    * Implement a Pull Request for a confirmed bug.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nHere's a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with my use case:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI()\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Category(int, Enum):\r\n    MISC = 0\r\n    LIFE = 1\r\n    CODE = 2\r\n    GUIDES = 3\r\n    PROJECTS = 4\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.get(\"/stuff\")\r\ndef read_root(category: Category):\r\n    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `$uvicorn test:app`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n* Open the browser and call the endpoint `/stuff?category=1`.\r\n* It returns a 422 error `\"value is not a valid enumeration member; permitted: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\"` even though the correct int enum value is provided. \r\n* **Expected:** It returns a JSON with `{\"Hello\": \"World\"}`.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* OS: macOS\r\n* FastAPI Version: 0.61.1\r\n* Python version: 3.8.5\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI've looked through all pydantic issues, found [this one](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1735), but I don't know if it's related, or what it's current status (whether it has been resolved).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastapi/fastapi/issues/2129/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastapi/fastapi/issues/2129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3862998453,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4NjI5OTg0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/3862998453","actor":{"login":"PrettyWood","id":18406791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18406791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood","html_url":"https://github.com/PrettyWood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"366527e80566f01de73375fb33e54ff84400ff1e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PrettyWood/pydantic/commits/366527e80566f01de73375fb33e54ff84400ff1e","created_at":"2020-10-10T18:21:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3890609168,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg5MDYwOTE2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/3890609168","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-18T19:53:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3890609228,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4OTA2MDkyMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/3890609228","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ab671a36708a14017e2ccc62f72c9f7628628737","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/commits/ab671a36708a14017e2ccc62f72c9f7628628737","created_at":"2020-10-18T19:53:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1264415113","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1735#issuecomment-1264415113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1735","id":1264415113,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBWBCuM5LXXGJ","user":{"login":"AtaiAmbus","id":74783402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NzgzNDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74783402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtaiAmbus","html_url":"https://github.com/AtaiAmbus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A
