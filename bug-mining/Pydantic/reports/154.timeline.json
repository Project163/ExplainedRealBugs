Change Summary\r\nRight now we always copy a `BaseModel` when validated, which should not be the default behaviour IMHO.\r\n\r\n**While working on this I thought about \"feature flags\" to be able to change the behaviour of all _pydantic_ models but probably other classes / metaclasses** Don't know if we want to put everything in the `BaseConfig` or if we want to separate what's global and local to a `BaseModel`.\r\n\r\nℹ️ I opened a discussion #2194 and added some documentation if we stick to the current way in #2211\r\nDepending on what's decided, I'll update this PR and add some
