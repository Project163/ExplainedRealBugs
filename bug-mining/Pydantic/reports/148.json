Mypy flags `Literal[Bar.FIZ]` above as an enum field, so accessing `value` on the `barfiz` attribute, for example, is perfectly fine by Mypy's rules, but breaks during runtime.\r\n\r\nI realize that mypy's support for Literal enum fields is relatively new, but they have interesting properties that I am looking to make use of (I would love to see this work with [discriminated union types](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/619), for example).\r\n\r\nWould you consider adding a Config field to enable this behaviour? Should this be flagged as a bug instead and targetted for a 2.0 release?\r\n\r\nPossibly related bugs:\r\n* https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1086\r\n* https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1747","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
