seems to me to be two ways of doing this:\r\n1. when serialising the model, check whether each field's value matches its default, and ignore ones that do.\r\n2. keep a record of which values are missing (and/or have the default value?) when initially parsing the input data to create a model.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be for 1. since it won't affect parsing performance and shouldn't affect serialisation performance unless `skip_optional=True` is set.\r\n\r\nThere's also the question do we:\r\n* skip all fields which have the default value from the model\r\n* or, skip only fields which are (somehow?) annotated as \"skipped when default\"\r\n\r\nlet me know your thoughts on both these points and we'll go from there.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that that is possible, but we need to think

Our implementation is to add a set called `changed_keys` which becomes a copy of the input dictionary keys and then if a field is set during a run the `changed_keys` set is updated with that key. When `dict` is called the `exclude` field is updated with this `changed_keys` set. The effect on the performance would likely be minimal.\r\n\r\n2) I think it would be good to have control over which fields are excluded by default. This could either be in the `Config.skip_defaults={\"key1\", ...}` where the exclude field would be `changed_keys & skip_defaults` or using a custom type like `value: DefaultSkip[str]= \"hello` which would then internally build the `skip_defaults` set.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it, the `Config.skip_defaults` (or whatever name) seems like the way to go.
