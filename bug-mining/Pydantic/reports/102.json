Unfortunately I can only recreate the issue when using the models in `fastAPI` endpoints. It's definitely a change in `pydantic` that introduced the issue (if I downgrade back to 1.4, the issue disappears), but it might be due to some quirky way that `fastAPI` is using pydantic models. In that case I'm happy to reraise the issue in the `fastAPI` project.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm seeing is that if I reuse a required `Field(...)` in two separate models, only the first model correctly tells me that a required input is missing. The second model gets (incorrectly) instantiated with the required value set to `None`.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI()\r\nrequired_field = Field(...)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Model1(BaseModel):\r\n    required: str = required_field\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Model2(BaseModel):\r\n    required: str = required_field\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.post(\"/expected\")\r\nasync def expected(i: Model1):\r\n    return i\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.post(\"/unexpected\")\r\nasync def unexpected(i: Model2):\r\n    return i\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if you fire some requests, you can see the weird difference in behavior between the `/expected` and `/unexpected` endpoint.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl localhost:8000/expected -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{}'\r\n{\"detail\":[{\"loc\":[\"body\",\"i\",\"required\"],\"msg\":\"field required\",\"type\":\"value_error.missing\"}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl localhost:8000/unexpected -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{}'\r\n{\"required\":null}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe you can think of some change to `Field` between 1.4 and 1.5 that could be behind this weird behavior? If not I'm happy to try and isolate the problem some more and look into exactly how `fastAPI` is using the pydantic models and what might go wrong there.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
