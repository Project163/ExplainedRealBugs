Initial Checks\n\n- [X] I have searched GitHub for a duplicate issue and I'm sure this is something new\n- [X] I have searched Google & StackOverflow for a solution and couldn't find anything\n- [X] I have read and followed [the docs](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io) and still think this is a bug\n- [X] I am confident that the issue is with pydantic (not my code, or another library in the ecosystem like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) or [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable))\n\n\n### Description\n\nThe following example causes a RecursionError\n\n### Example Code\n\n```Python\nfrom typing import Optional, TypedDict\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass RecursiveTypedDict(TypedDict):\r\n    foo: Optional[\"RecursiveTypedDict\"]\r\n\r\nclass Model(BaseModel):\r\n    rec: RecursiveTypedDict\n```\n\n\n### Python, Pydantic & OS Version\n\n```Text\npydantic version: 1.10.4\r\n            pydantic compiled: False\r\n                 install path: /Users/adriangarciabadaracco/GitHub/pydantic/pydantic\r\n               python version: 3.10.9 (main, Jan 27 2023, 18:06:58) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)]\r\n                     platform: macOS-13.0-arm64-arm-64bit\r\n     optional deps. installed: ['devtools', 'dotenv', 'email-validator', 'typing-extensions']\n```\n\n\n### Affected Components\n\n- [ ] [Compatibility between releases](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/changelog/)\n- [ ] [Data validation/parsing](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#basic-model-usage)\n- [ ] [Data serialization](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/exporting_models/) - `.model_dump()` and `.model_dump_json()`\n- [ ] [JSON Schema](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/schema/)\n- [ ] [Dataclasses](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/)\n- [ ] [Model Config](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/model_config/)\n- [X] [Field Types](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/) - adding or changing a particular data type\n- [ ] [Function validation decorator](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validation_decorator/)\n- [ ] [Generic Models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#generic-models)\n- [ ] [Other Model behaviour](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) - `model_construct()`, pickling, private attributes, ORM mode\n- [ ] [Plugins](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and integration with other tools - mypy, FastAPI, python-devtools, Hypothesis, VS Code, PyCharm,
