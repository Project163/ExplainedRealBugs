pydantic\r\n\r\nclass Foo(pydantic.BaseModel):\r\n    bar: str = pydantic.Field(..., regex='baz')\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    Foo(bar='bar baz quux')\r\nexcept pydantic.ValidationError as e:\r\n

Valid\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn JSON Schema, all versions so far, the regular expression in the `pattern` keyword is treated as [unanchored at both ends][1], i.e. `re.search` behavior rather than `re.match` or `re.fullmatch`.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-handrews-json-schema-validation-01#section-4.3\r\n\r\nPydantic uses `re.match` to validate strings with `Field` `regex` argument, as explained in #1396.\r\n\r\nWhen constructing a JSON Schema from a model, Pydantic generates a `pattern` keyword from a `Field` `regex` argument, without any regex postprocessing. Thus, the resulting JSON Schema validates differently from the original Pydantic model.\r\n\r\nI strongly feel Pydantic should follow suit and use `re.search` to validate fields with `regex` argument, and explicitly call this out in the documentation. (Anchors in example usage are not sufficient.)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you are concerned with backward compatibility, I propose the following long-term solution:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new `Field` (and `constr`) argument, perhaps named `pattern` after the JSON Schema keyword, mutually exclusive with the existing `regex` argument. This is API extension, thus, backward compatible.\r\n2. Implement validation for `pattern` using `re.search`.\r\n3. Change the behavior of `BaseModel.schema` to copy the `pattern` `Field` argument to the `pattern` schema keyword as is if present. This way, new users of the `pattern` argument get correct schema generation.\r\n4. One or more of:\r\n    * Fix the behavior of `BaseModel.schema` so that a `regex` argument with value `REGEX` produces a schema `pattern` keyword with value `^(REGEX)`. (The grouping is necessary because the original regex may contain alternatives.) This way, users of the `regex` argument get schemas that behave consistently with the original Pydantic model.\r\n    * Deprecate `regex`, suggesting `pattern` with explicit anchoring.\r\n    * Emit a warning if a model containing fields with the `regex` argument is used to generate a JSON Schema.
