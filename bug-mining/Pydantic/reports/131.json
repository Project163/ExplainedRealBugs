I was happy to see Pydantic 1.7 came out today and had support for private fields built in. I upgraded and tried to convert my code, but I encountered some unusual problems. (Even though it doesn't work perfectly, I still appreciate the feature.) Most are type errors from mypy (might report later), but this one is more serious. I simplified the problem below.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that `underscore_attrs_are_private` causes an exception where `PrivateAttr` does not.\r\n\r\nWhen using `underscore_attrs_are_private` with the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass TestObject(BaseModel):\r\n    public_field: str\r\n    _private_field: str\r\n\r\n    class Config:\r\n        underscore_attrs_are_private = True\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, **data: Any) -> None:\r\n        super().__init__(**data)\r\n        self._private_field = \"bar\"\r\n\r\nprint(TestObject(public_field=\"foo\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest.py:4: DeprecationWarning: __class__ not set defining 'TestObject' as <class '__main__.TestObject'>. Was __classcell__ propagated to type.__new__?\r\n  class TestObject(BaseModel):\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test.py\", line 15, in <module>\r\n    print(TestObject(public_field=\"foo\"))\r\n  File \"test.py\", line 12, in __init__\r\n    super().__init__(**data)\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 365, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 424, in pydantic.main.BaseModel._init_private_attributes\r\n  File \"pydantic/fields.py\", line 821, in pydantic.fields.PrivateAttr.get_default\r\n  File \"pydantic/utils.py\", line 624, in pydantic.utils.smart_deepcopy\r\n  File \"/Users/ahedges/.pyenv/versions/3.7.8/lib/python3.7/copy.py\", line 169, in deepcopy\r\n    rv = reductor(4)\r\nTypeError: can't pickle cell objects\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when using `PrivateAttr` with the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, PrivateAttr\r\n\r\nclass TestObject(BaseModel):\r\n    public_field: str\r\n    _private_field: str = PrivateAttr()\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, **data: Any) -> None:\r\n        super().__init__(**data)\r\n        self._private_field = \"bar\"\r\n\r\nprint(TestObject(public_field=\"foo\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following, desired output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic_field='foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also noticed that removing `__init__()` from the first example also prevents the crash. However, it is needed to set the private field.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that in my full code, the exception caused by `underscore_attrs_are_private` appears but the `DeprecationWarning` does not. If you think this matters, I can try to reproduce my code without the warning.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2047/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
