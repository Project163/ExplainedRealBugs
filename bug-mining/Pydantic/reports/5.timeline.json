In 99% of cases people wouldn't care about coping the values and copying the values will be significantly slower. Example take the case (roughtly aiohttp but any other web framework and many other cases would be the case):\r\n\r\n```py\r\nasync def my_view(request):\r\n    try:\r\n        m = Model(**await request.json())\r\n    except ValidationError as e:\r\n        raise BadRequestError(**e.dict())\r\n    ... do stuff with m\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the primary use case for pydantic (at least for me) and I want it to remain as performant as possible (both in terms of CPU and memory). I really don't want to copy all the data from the result of `.json()` here.\r\n\r\nWe also can't add keyword arguments to `Model.__init__()` for fear of conflicting with input data. Instead I would suggest we add a class method `Model.parse_copy()`.\r\n\r\nFor the same kinds of reason I don't really want `.dict()` to make a copy by default (for example `.json()` uses `.dict()` and definitely wouldn't require a copy) but here we could add an argument to deep copy the data\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Would you be willing to submit a PR for some or all of this?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/415967683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/415967769","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/249#issuecomment-415967769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/249","id":415967769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTk2Nzc2OQ==","user":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-25T13:01:47Z","updated_at":"2018-08-25T13:01:47Z","body":"BTW,

Change Summary\r\n\r\nUsing `model.copy(deep=True)` will deep copy a module instance.\r\n\r\nMaking a deep copy is useful for models that have lists of dicts or\r\nany other non-simple data structure

Changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n- Allow for ZEP config change to be saved as part of normal `save` operation\r\n- Add a fake/shallow `__deep_copy__` implementation to the `ZEP` experimental base model to get around `instiante_class_from_config` `deep_copy()` pickling connection issues.\r\n  - emit warnings whenever this `__deep_copy__` is called\r\n- minimal typing of `instiante_class_from_config()`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- [x] My code follows the Great Expectations [style
