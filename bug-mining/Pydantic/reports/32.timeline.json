PR welcome to fix that.\r\n\r\nRegarding `Field name \"schema\" shadows a BaseModel attribute; use a different field name with \"alias='schema'` that's harder to fix since the underlying model `__pydantic_model__` is a normal pydantic model, so won't play nicely with `schema` as a field. Maybe we should change the error message, to make more sense in this context.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, perhaps all those methods should have had other names, but it's too late now.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/467518287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2165487192,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxNjU0ODcxOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2165487192","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-26T16:50:30Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"pilosus","id":6400248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDAyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6400248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus","html_url":"https://github.com/pilosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-28T09:15:25Z","updated_at":"2019-03-28T09:15:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/438","id":426379531,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjY1MjQ0MDQw","number":438,"title":"Dataclass
