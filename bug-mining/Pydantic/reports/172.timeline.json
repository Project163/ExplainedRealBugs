the bug**\r\nNot sure Ormar will be able to do anything.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nUpon running a query, there's some Pydantic validation happening, and it ends up with a runtime error when deep-copying data.\r\nIt seems that it is due to an element (of the model being deep-copied) being a submodel, and that upon accessing it, or another attribute of the parent model, it is loaded, changing the dictionary size somehow.\r\n\r\nHere's the query:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npackages = await Package.objects.select_related([\"library\", \"tickets__ticket\"]).exclude(version__contains=\".x\").all()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat query triggers the runtime error mentioned above. If I either remove `tickets__ticket`, or go down to the submodel with `tickets__ticket__team`, the error disappears.\r\n\r\n```python\r\npackages = await Package.objects.select_related([\"library\"]).exclude(version__contains=\".x\").all()  # ok\r\npackages = await Package.objects.select_related([\"library\", \"tickets__ticket__team\"]).exclude(version__contains=\".x\").all()  # ok\r\n```\r\n\r\nTraceback:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n$ python sara.py \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"sara.py\", line 26, in <module>\r\n    asyncio.run(amain())\r\n  File \"/home/user/.basher-packages/pyenv/pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python3.8/asyncio/runners.py\", line 44, in run\r\n    return loop.run_until_complete(main)\r\n  File \"/home/user/.basher-packages/pyenv/pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python3.8/asyncio/base_events.py\", line 616, in run_until_complete\r\n    return future.result()\r\n  File \"sara.py\", line 9, in amain\r\n    monitoring_ticket_id = await suggest_monitoring()\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/src/project/sara/monitoring.py\", line 114, in suggest\r\n    libraries = await suggest_monitoring_libraries()\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/src/project/suggest.py\", line 150, in suggest_monitoring_libraries\r\n    await Package.objects.select_related([\"library\", \"tickets__ticket\"]).exclude(version__contains=\".x\").all()\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/__pypackages__/3.8/lib/ormar/queryset/queryset.py\", line 1053, in all\r\n    result_rows = self._process_query_result_rows(rows)\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/__pypackages__/3.8/lib/ormar/queryset/queryset.py\", line 184, in _process_query_result_rows\r\n    result_rows = [\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/__pypackages__/3.8/lib/ormar/queryset/queryset.py\", line 185, in <listcomp>\r\n    self.model.from_row(\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/__pypackages__/3.8/lib/ormar/models/model_row.py\", line 84, in from_row\r\n    item = cls._populate_nested_models_from_row(\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/__pypackages__/3.8/lib/ormar/models/model_row.py\", line 203, in _populate_nested_models_from_row\r\n    child = model_cls.from_row(\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/__pypackages__/3.8/lib/ormar/models/model_row.py\", line 104, in from_row\r\n    instance = cast(\"Model\", cls(**item))\r\n  File \"/home/user/dev/project/__pypackages__/3.8/lib/ormar/models/newbasemodel.py\", line 140, in __init__\r\n    values, fields_set, validation_error = pydantic.validate_model(\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 1038, in pydantic.main.validate_model\r\n  File \"pydantic/fields.py\", line 857, in pydantic.fields.ModelField.validate\r\n  File \"pydantic/fields.py\", line 1067, in pydantic.fields.ModelField._validate_singleton\r\n  File \"pydantic/fields.py\", line 857, in pydantic.fields.ModelField.validate\r\n  File \"pydantic/fields.py\", line 1074, in pydantic.fields.ModelField._validate_singleton\r\n  File \"pydantic/fields.py\", line 1121, in pydantic.fields.ModelField._apply_validators\r\n  File \"pydantic/class_validators.py\", line 313, in pydantic.class_validators._generic_validator_basic.lambda12\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 679, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.validate\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 605, in pydantic.main.BaseModel._copy_and_set_values\r\n  File \"/home/user/.basher-packages/pyenv/pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python3.8/copy.py\", line 146, in deepcopy\r\n    y = copier(x, memo)\r\n  File \"/home/user/.basher-packages/pyenv/pyenv/versions/3.8.11/lib/python3.8/copy.py\", line 229, in _deepcopy_dict\r\n    for key, value in x.items():\r\nRuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo runtime error.\r\n\r\n**Versions (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Database backend used: sqlite\r\n - Python version: 3.8.11\r\n - `ormar` version: 0.11.0\r\n - `pydantic` version: 1.9.1\r\n - if applicable `fastapi` version: 0.78.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe code triggering the error did not always trigger it.
