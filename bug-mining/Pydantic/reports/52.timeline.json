Feature Request\r\n\r\nWe want to define our own generic container-types (similar to `List[T]`), but we want to do the type-checking on our own:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Array(numpy.ndarray, Collection[T]):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def get_validators(cls):\r\n        yield cls.validate_type\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def validate_type(cls, val):\r\n        return np.array(val,

Problem\r\n\r\nFor now, pydantic assumes that generic types are from a selected set (Tuple, List, Mapping, plus a few others) and therefore this assertion error is thrown [here](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/725e86a8f0ebdfb509e8a70384b5d45e0788ae46/pydantic/fields.py#L173):\r\n\r\n\r\n```py\r\nassert issubclass(origin, Mapping)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\nAllowing this, could generally be done in two ways:\r\n\r\n* Treat custom generic types not differently than other types. The type-parameter is just ignored by pydantic.\r\n* Have a notion of general generic types in pydantic, and provide a validation-interface which allows users to interact with the type-parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/380/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/496548799","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/556#issuecomment-496548799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/556","id":496548799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NjU0ODc5OQ==","user":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-28T14:46:56Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T14:46:56Z","body":">

Change Summary\r\n\r\nAdds some functionality around generics.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely some edge cases not perfectly handled yet, but I wanted to get your take on this before I invest more effort. A number of people from the FastAPI community seem interested in this functionality, but if you think it's going to be too hard to maintain then we can let it go.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I think the `create_model` function is actually doing 90% of the work necessary to get this working.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/556\r\n\r\n##

is sometimes useful to restrict types of fields of fields of a node.\r\n\r\n__Objectives__\r\n- Reduce the amount of verification boilerplate code inside the translators.\r\n- Reduce the amount of state to be passed to child nodes inside the translators\r\n- Elimination of redundant nodes\r\n\r\nPydantic supports this out of the box (see https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/556 and https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/pull/595).\r\n\r\n__Open questions__:\r\n\r\n1. How to check for a field type to be a subtype of generic type? This will be a common question if we allow this, but Python does not allow subclass checks with generic, i.e. the following does not work:\r\n  ```python\r\n  from typing import Generic, TypeVar, List\r\n  # raises: TypeError: Subscripted generics cannot be used with class and instance checks\r\n  issubclass(List[int], List[T])\r\n  ```\r\n2. Consequences of changing the Node base class to GenericModel\r\n3. Is this compatible with mypy?\r\n\r\n__Example 1__\r\n```python\r\nT = TypeVar('T')\r\nclass Constant(GT4PyAstNode, Generic[T]):\r\n    value: T\r\n\r\nclass ExampleNode:\r\n    some_int_constant: Constant[Int]\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Example 2__\r\n```python\r\nT = TypeVar('T')\r\n\r\nclass Stencil(GTScriptAstNode, Generic[T]):\r\n    iteration_spec: List[Union[IterationOrder, LocationSpecification, Interval]]\r\n    body: List[T]\r\n\r\nclass Computation(GTScriptAstNode):\r\n    name: str\r\n    arguments: List[Argument]\r\n    stencils: List[Union[Stencil[Stencil[Statement]], Stencil[Statement]]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GridTools/gtc/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GridTools/gtc/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11331393517,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBWBCuM4awnjbzwAAAAKjZ1ft","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/11331393517","actor":{"login":"alexdrydew","id":39103632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTAzNjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39103632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew","html_url":"https://github.com/alexdrydew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ba8079bf11d7c0992d767089b6bf7c53fec84843","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alexdrydew/pydantic/commits/ba8079bf11d7c0992d767089b6bf7c53fec84843","created_at":"2023-12-23T20:10:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
