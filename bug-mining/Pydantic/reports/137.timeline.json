These all *exclude* zero.\r\n\r\nI want classes which *include* zero.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `NonNegativeInt`, `NonPositiveInt`, `NonNegativeFloat`, `NonPositiveFloat`.\r\n\r\nI have updated the documentation. Should I add an explicit explanation somewhere of the difference between \"positive\" and \"non-negative\"? Where should I do that?\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\n#1975 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [x] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at 100%\r\n* [x] Documentation reflects the changes where applicable\r\n* [x] `changes/<pull request or issue id>-<github username>.md` file added describing change\r\n  (see [changes/README.md](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/master/changes/README.md) for details)\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with pytest.
