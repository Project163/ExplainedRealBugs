see, thanks. This now makes sense given the logic. Now that I've had time to digest this some more, I feel like this is a bug in Pydantic (especially because the field is identified by mypy as an enum field rather than a string).\r\n\r\nDo you think any other types are subject to this issue? My guess is that this behaviour is unusual and specific to Enums because `\"fiz\" == Bar.FIZ` evaluates to `True` even though `isinstance(\"fiz\", Bar)` evaluates to `False`.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to look more closely at a solution for this problem, but I am worried about breaking backwards compatibility in a 1.X release, so I'm also wondering what the recommended direction is for this

@yobiscus \r\nHonestly I feel like this is a bug too. And it can apply to a lot of classes with tolerant `__eq__` check though the `StrEnum` is probably the most common one (`__eq__` from `str` and from `Enum`).\r\nI opened a PR with the code I showed you.\r\nIf you find a better way to do it or think it can break things, feel free to react to it!! 👍 \r\nHave a great day","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/739788399/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PrettyWood","id":18406791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18406791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood","html_url":"https://github.com/PrettyWood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4078565666,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA3ODU2NTY2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/4078565666","actor":{"login":"yobiscus","id":65927223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTI3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65927223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus","html_url":"https://github.com/yobiscus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-07T09:19:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4078565672,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwNzg1NjU2NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/4078565672","actor":{"login":"yobiscus","id":65927223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTI3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65927223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus","html_url":"https://github.com/yobiscus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yobiscus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-07T09:19:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4078599378,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQwNzg1OTkzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/4078599378","actor":{"login":"PrettyWood","id":18406791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18406791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood","html_url":"https://github.com/PrettyWood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d01bc90f0dc33726b53c22d0c93ed895277efe5a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PrettyWood/pydantic/commits/d01bc90f0dc33726b53c22d0c93ed895277efe5a","cr

tagged unions. However, they are not usable by Pydantic, which tries to compare the original input string to the enum member, without trying to convert the input to an enum member.\r\n\r\nThis is the second [Literal example](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#literal-type), adapted to using Enum members instead of string literals:\r\n```py\r\nimport enum\r\nfrom typing import ClassVar, List, Union, Literal\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\n\r\nclass DessertTypes(enum.Enum):\r\n    CAKE = 'cake'\r\n    ICE_CREAM = 'icecream'\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Cake(BaseModel):\r\n    kind: Literal[DessertTypes.CAKE]\r\n    required_utensils: ClassVar[List[str]] = ['fork', 'knife']\r\n\r\n\r\nclass IceCream(BaseModel):\r\n    kind: Literal[DessertTypes.ICE_CREAM]\r\n    required_utensils: ClassVar[List[str]] = ['spoon']\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Meal(BaseModel):\r\n    dessert: Union[Cake, IceCream]\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(type(Meal(dessert={'kind': 'cake'}).dessert).__name__)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\n```\r\nCake\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual output:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".../cake_example.py\", line 26, in <module>\r\n    print(type(Meal(dessert={'kind': 'cake'}).dessert).__name__)\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 362, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__\r\npydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 2 validation errors for Meal\r\ndessert -> kind\r\n  unexpected value; permitted: <DessertTypes.CAKE: 'cake'> (type=value_error.const; given=cake; permitted=(<DessertTypes.CAKE: 'cake'>,))\r\ndessert -> kind\r\n  unexpected value; permitted: <DessertTypes.ICE_CREAM: 'icecream'> (type=value_error.const; given=cake; permitted=(<DessertTypes.ICE_CREAM: 'icecream'>,))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was reported in late 2019 as well, in issue #1086. There, Samuel asked that a new issue be created if support for `Literal[DessertTypes.CAKE]` was desired in the future. Please consider this that issue 🙂 \r\n\r\nIn the original issue, it was assumed that MyPy didn't support Enum instances inside Literal. It turns out that this was a case of outdated documentation at Mypy, according to python/mypy#8152, and Mypy does indeed support enum members inside Literal 🎉\r\n\r\nI was confused that Pydantic didn't support this and wondered if I had done something wrong since I was used to it working with Mypy, so if the conclusion is to not implement this (now), it might help some other people out if the documentation mentioned this limitation.\r\n\r\nIf I defined the enum as `class DessertTypes(str, enum.Enum)` it actually works as expected. Or, at least it will when the fix for #2166 makes it into a release (right now, you would end up with a `str` in the `Literal[DessertType.CAKE]` field). I'm not sure if that's a desired workaround or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2257/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
