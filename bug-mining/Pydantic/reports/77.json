The behavior between static and dynamic classes is different now.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Optional\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import create_model, BaseModel\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_optional_value():\r\n    class Test(BaseModel):\r\n        field1: str\r\n        field2: Optional[str]\r\n\r\n    Test(field1=\"a\", field2=\"b\")\r\n    Test(field1=\"a\")\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_dynamic_optional_value():\r\n    fields = {'field1': (str, ...), 'field2': (Optional[str], ...)}\r\n    Test = create_model(\"Test\", __base__=BaseModel, **fields)\r\n\r\n    Test(field1=\"a\", field2=\"b\")\r\n    Test(field1=\"a\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith pydantic 1.1.1 both test cases succeed, with pydantic 1.2 the dynamic test case fails.\r\n\r\nIs this expected? Based on the changelog and the documentation I am inclined to think it is not. Should I open a separate bug?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @bartv in https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/990#issuecomment-559708568_","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1047/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1047/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
