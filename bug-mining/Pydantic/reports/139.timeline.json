like other primitive values, but couldn't get it to work.\r\nI roughly read the implementation and found that kwargs like `example` are treated as extra schema and get added in `get_field_schema_validations`, which is skipped if the type is Enum. But I was wondering why this is done here, as extras are not particularly meant for validations (maybe there's validation related ones but I think not all of it is). IMO it's better to update the schema in `get_field_info_schema` where the titles and descriptions are processed, as extras are also more towards general stuff and less like validators.\r\n\r\nI've already created a patch in my own fork, but maybe I'm making a huge misassumption here, so I'd like to open an issue first. Any advice or filling me in with the code's background will be appreciated.
