\r\n\r\nThe only thing modified that is of interest, and I'm not too sure about, is the order in `field_class_to_schema_enum_disabled`\r\n\r\nShould have I kept the original order (Address > Interface > Network) then both `test_ipv4interface_type` and `test_ipv6interface_type` would fail with the following:\r\n\r\ntest_ipv4interface_type\r\n```\r\nE         Full diff:\r\nE         - {'properties': {'ip_interface': {'format': 'ipv4address',\r\nE         ?                                                  ^^^ --\r\nE         + {'properties': {'ip_interface': {'format': 'ipv4interface',\r\nE

json-schema-org/json-schema-spec#498 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [x] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at 100%\r\n* [x] Documentation reflects the
