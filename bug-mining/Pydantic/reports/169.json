Prior to that change, the following code worked:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom types import SimpleNamespace\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\n\r\nclass User(BaseModel):\r\n    first_name: str\r\n    last_name: str\r\n\r\n    class Config:\r\n        orm_mode = True\r\n\r\n\r\nclass State(BaseModel):\r\n    user: User\r\n\r\n\r\n# Pass an \"orm instance\"\r\nstate = State.from_orm(SimpleNamespace(user=SimpleNamespace(first_name='John', last_name='Appleseed')))\r\n\r\n# Pass dictionary data directly\r\nstate = State(**{'user': {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Appleseed'}})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that change, the final line throws a validation error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/luke/Developer/Clients/doctorschoice/flow/orm_issue.py\", line 26, in <module>\r\n    state = State(**{'user': {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Appleseed'}})\r\n  File \"/Users/luke/.pyenv/versions/flow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pydantic/main.py\", line 330, in __init__\r\n    raise validation_error\r\npydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 2 validation errors for State\r\nuser -> first_name\r\n  field required (type=value_error.missing)\r\nuser -> last_name\r\n  field required (type=value_error.missing)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is actually a bit of an issue given the way FastAPI handles response models. During the processing of a request, it serializes the data, and then passes it through a response model (if one was provided) to make sure the response matches the desired output schema. If you're using an ORM-mode model for convenience (like one generated from Tortoise-ORM's `pydantic_model_creator`), it now crashes with a validation error.","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
