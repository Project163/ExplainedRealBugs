Particularly the fact that `self` has a very well established and understood meaning in the Python world (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id46) and loss of the ability to do `Model(**kwargs)` is a very non-Pythonic way of doing things. Also feel free to just shoot this discussion down since Python conventions are only that and not really enforceable.\r\n\r\nI worry that defining an attribute within Python classes called `self` will very quickly lead to confusion among Python-centric users. I'm not versed in JSON API at all, but the use case for `self` seems a bit narrow from what I can read (I can't find a use case for `kwargs`, but I would be very interested to see one!). I don't want to discount it entirely, but I wanted to talk about it. I have an implementation in #644 to fix an inheritance bug, but it required me to choose a different arg than `self`. \r\n\r\nGiven that Pydantic is not JSON (although it does support interfaces to JSON Schema Core, JSON Schema Validation, and OpenAPI, but not JSON API), I'm not sure of the merits of putting this in because `self` is a neigh hallowed word in the Python world; and it makes me uneasy even in my own implementation. Even an attribute like `self.self` is very rare. I'm happy to discuss options, but I'm not sure I fully agree with this as a base-line feature from a (personal) Python-centric view.\r\n\r\nA possible alternate solution would be to make a special Type in Pydantic which can handle this so allowing `self` becomes a special case rather than the base line as I have implemented in #644, although I worry doing so would just make a special `BaseModel` which can have `self` in it serving to create just a derivative of `BaseModel` rather than a simple Type like `datetime`.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to have the pre-formatter as suggested above, which maps an arg like `self` to something else until the init is done and then you can have `self.self` internally if you need to, but I don't know how efficient that would be since it effectively adds a special case to all `__init__` calls. But these are implementation details rather than the philosophical details I'm more concerned about.

For example, in #644 I use `pydantic_base_model_init` instead of `self`, which will have the same problem as using `self` did pre-#632 if someone ever tried to use \"pydantic_base_model_init\" as one of their attributes. So my take is that if we have to have one word blocked out, it may as well be `self` since most Python users will likely be aware of it, or at minimum understand why that particular word is blocked if they try to use it.
