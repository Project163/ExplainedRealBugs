fix.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1017800712/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5927255355,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBWBCuM4kg5BFzwAAAAFhSr07","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/5927255355","actor":{"login":"mruser","id":5464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser","html_url":"https://github.com/mruser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-20T18:31:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5927255359,"node_id":"SE_lADOBWBCuM4kg5BFzwAAAAFhSr0_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/5927255359","actor":{"login":"mruser","id":5464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser","html_url":"https://github.com/mruser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mruser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-20T18:31:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1022949602","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1477#issuecomment-1022949602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1477","id":1022949602,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBWBCuM48-Pji","user":{"login":"malipek","id":8233412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMzM0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8233412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek","html_url":"https://github.com/malipek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malipek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-27T08:08:58Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T08:08:58Z","body":"Is
