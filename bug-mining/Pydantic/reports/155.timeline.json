`dataclass`. But `__annotations__` passed down when converted were not resolved properly so if we used `'Literal...'` or postponed annotations by default with `from __future__ import annotations`, it failed.\r\nThe main problem is that we don't set `__module__ = _cls.__module__` in the _pydantic_ `dataclass` but rather `__module__ = __name__`. This is done to allow pickling. So the `resolve_annotations` done in the metaclass fails.\r\nTo support both I suggest we simply call `resolve_annotations` when creating the new _pydantic_ `dataclass`\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [ ] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [ ] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at 100%\r\n* [ ] Documentation reflects the changes where applicable\r\n* [ ] `changes/<pull request or issue id>-<github username>.md` file added describing change\r\n  (see [changes/README.md](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/master/changes/README.md) for details)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/750847217","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1668#issuecomment-750847217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1668","id":750847217,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDg0NzIxNw==","user":{"login":"PrettyWood","id":18406791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18406791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood","html_url":"https://github.com/PrettyWood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T10:58:42Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T10:58:42Z","body":"Hi guys!

2:** see https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2678#issuecomment-1008139014, for a summary of how PEP 563 could effect pydantic.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update:** see [below](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2678#issuecomment-823539148) this has been resolved by a changes in python 3.10 from the python steering council.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for your thoughts, patience and hard work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) \"Postponed Evaluation of Annotations\" was introduced in python 3.7 behind the `from __future__ import annotations` switch, it basically meant all annotations are strings, not python objects.\r\n\r\nPydantic has tried to supported Postponed Annotations since `v0.18.0`, see #348.\r\n\r\nThe problem however is that trying to evaluate those strings to get the real annotation objects is really hard, perhaps impossible to always do correctly, see #248 #234 #397 #415 #486 #531 #545 #635 #655 #704 #1298 #1332 #1345 #1370 #1668 #1736 #1873 #1895 #2112 #2314 #2323 #2411 \r\n\r\nThe reasons are complicated but basically `typing.get_type_hints()` doesn't work all the time and neither do the numerous hacks we've introduced to try and get fix it. Even if `typing.get_type_hints()` was faultless, it would still be massively slower than the current semantics or PEP 649 (see below).\r\n\r\nIn short - pydantic doesn't work very well with postponed annotations, perhaps it never will.\r\n\r\n# The Problem\r\n\r\nThe problem is that postponed annotations are set to be come default in 3.10, features of which will be frozen in about three week.\r\n\r\nEven worse, there's no way to switch back to the current behaviour.\r\n\r\n# The Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution to this is [PEP 649](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0649/) developed by Larry Hastings. This basically means annotations evaluation is lazy - the work of building `__annotations__` isn't done until you access `__annotations__`.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell this is the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\n# The Second Problem\r\n\r\nThe sad reality however is that it seems very possible that PEP 649 will get rejected and when python 3.10 is released it will break much of pydantic, and thereby FastAPI and all the other libraries that rely on pydantic (as well as other libraries that use annotations at runtime like [enforce](https://github.com/RussBaz/enforce) and [typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) presumably).\r\n\r\nSee [this very long discussion](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/QSASX6PZ3LIIFIANHQQFS752BJYFUFPY/#UITB2A657TAINAGWGRD6GCKWFC5PEBIZ) of the issue on **python-dev** about whether PEP 649 is a good idea.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# The Point\r\n\r\nSo why am I saying all this apart from whinging about something I don't agree with?\r\n\r\n## 1. This is fair warning\r\n\r\nThat pydantic might break in a big way if python's core developers continue value principle over pragmatism.\r\n\r\n## 2.  You can help\r\n\r\nThousands of developers and organisations big and small rely on pydantic. Type hints might have been conceived to help readers and static type checkers, but they're now used to great effect at runtime by lots and lots of people - they make python better.\r\n\r\nIn the end I don't think python's core developers and [steering council](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8102/) want to make your experience of python worse. They just haven't realised how important this is. (Even Larry hadn't heard of pydantic or FastAPI until yesterday when he emailed me, I guess they don't read the [python developer survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/) 😉)\r\n\r\n~If you value pydantic or FastAPI or other libraries that use annotations at runtime, please (constructively and respectfully) let the python steering council know that you would like PEP 649 to be accepted.~ Please don't contact members of the python community, they're aware of this issue (see below) and are taking it seriously.\r\n\r\nI understand the decision on PEP 649 will be made

#1668.\r\nthis issue was closed a year ago but the error still occurs in the latest version (1.9.0) \r\n\r\nIt looks like when the subtype is in the same file, `ForwardRef`s are automatically resolved, but when they are in a different file you are presented with `field \"x\" not yet prepared so type is still a ForwardRef, you might need to call X.update_forward_refs().`.\r\n\r\nBut when you call `X.__pydantic_model__.update_forward_refs()` you can get `NameError: name 'Y' is not defined`. I believe this is due to Pydantic using the wrong namespace to evaluate the forward refs of the base types.\r\n\r\nThanks @KotlinIsland for minifying
