sensitive data directly to the database without any redaction, In my case it's the json received by the client that I want to put to the database.\r\n\r\nI follow the official documentation, and the only way to handle that is to get programmatically the values:\r\n(https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/types/secrets/)\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass SimpleModel(BaseModel):\r\n    password: SecretStr\r\n    password_bytes: SecretBytes\r\n\r\n\r\nsm = SimpleModel(password='IAmSensitive', password_bytes=b'IAmSensitiveBytes')\r\n\r\n# Standard access methods will not display the secret\r\nprint(sm)\r\n#> password=SecretStr('**********') password_bytes=SecretBytes(b'**********')\r\nprint(sm.password)\r\n#> **********\r\nprint(sm.model_dump())\r\n\"\"\"\r\n{\r\n    'password': SecretStr('**********'),\r\n    'password_bytes': SecretBytes(b'**********'),\r\n}\r\n\"\"\"\r\nprint(sm.model_dump_json())\r\n#> {\"password\":\"**********\",\"password_bytes\":\"**********\"}\r\n\r\n# Use get_secret_value method to see the secret's content.\r\nprint(sm.password.get_secret_value())\r\n#> IAmSensitive\r\nprint(sm.password_bytes.get_secret_value())\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What I expect as feature:\r\n\r\nThe feature that I request is to evolve the dump json to request in some exception to dump the secrets:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsm.model_dump_json(with_secrets=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor using `field_serializer` and adding `sensitive` to `when_used`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass SimpleModelDumpable(BaseModel):\r\n    password: SecretStr\r\n    password_bytes: SecretBytes\r\n\r\n    @field_serializer('password', 'password_bytes', when_used='sensitive')\r\n    def dump_secret(self, v):\r\n        return v.get_secret_value()\r\n\r\n\r\nsm2 = SimpleModelDumpable(\r\n    password='IAmSensitive', password_bytes=b'IAmSensitiveBytes'\r\n)\r\n\r\nprint(sm2.model_dump_json(mode=\"sensitive\"))\r\n#> {\"password\":\"IAmSensitive\",\"password_bytes\":\"IAmSensitiveBytes\"}\r\nprint(sm2.model_dump_json())\r\n#> {\"password\":\"*********\",\"password_bytes\":\"******\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why this request:\r\n\r\nI see many uses cases on which the API is like a validator of data and a proxy between a client and a database tier, there are also many cascading models on which we have to dive to get these values, patch the object and then send to the database.\r\nI think that by implementing this feature we can do on the API something like:\r\n1. On PUT or POST: model_dump_json(mode=\"sensitive\") then send to the database\r\n2. On GET : model_dump_json() then return to the client\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Affected Components\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Compatibility between releases](https://docs.pydantic.dev/changelog/)\r\n- [ ] [Data validation/parsing](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models/#basic-model-usage)\r\n- [X] [Data serialization](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/exporting_models/) - `.model_dump()` and

Thank you for your contribution! -->\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\nAs described and discussed in [pydantic#7143](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/7143), it would make sense to be able to pass a ``context`` object to ``.model_dump()``/``.model_dump_json()`` in order to dynamically update the serialization behavior during runtime.\r\nThis PR is my attempt at implementing this feature. This is my first time with Rust, so you should be wary about it :).\r\nI tested this implementation with (an accordingly-modified) pydantic and everything seemed to work.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\n[pydantic#7143](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/7143)\r\nThe pydantic side of the change is very light, I have a commit ready for it in case this PR gets merged.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [x] Documentation reflects the changes where applicable\r\n* [x] Pydantic tests pass with this `pydantic-core` (except for expected changes)\r\n* [x] My PR is ready to review, **please add a comment including the phrase \"please review\" to assign reviewers**\r\n\n\nSelected Reviewer:

27th.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8993/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12257145175,"node_id":"CE_lADOBWBCuM5udpAezwAAAALalTFX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/12257145175","actor":{"login":"sydney-runkle","id":54324534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzI0NTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54324534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle","html_url":"https://github.com/sydney-runkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-26T22:00:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12257145189,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBWBCuM5udpAezwAAAALalTFl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/12257145189","actor":{"login":"sydney-runkle","id":54324534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzI0NTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54324534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle","html_url":"https://github.com/sydney-runkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b9ec63fe68b40a356c5003996d5e866aeb4aae7e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/commits/b9ec63fe68b40a356c5003996d5e866aeb4aae7e","created_at":"2024-03-26T22:00:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sbasan","id":116343782,"node_id":"U_kgDOBu9D5g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116343782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan","html_url":"https://github.com/sbasan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbasan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-18T10:58:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-18T10:58:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cisco-open/cisco-catalyst-wan-sdk/issues/27","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cisco-open/cisco-catalyst-wan-sdk","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cisco-open/cisco-catalyst-wan-sdk/issues/27/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cisco-open/cisco-catalyst-wan-sdk/issues/27/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cisco-open/cisco-catalyst-wan-sdk/issues/27/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cisco-open/cisco-catalyst-wan-sdk/pull/27","id":2250391137,"node_id":"PR_kwDOLdGnP85tCM6z","number":27,"title":"context

Pull Request summary:\r\nIt is now possible to have different serialization alias to be chosen dynamically based on running Manager api version.\r\nThis extends the possibility to reuse single payload model definition for different Manager API versions.\r\n\r\nWe are utilizing a new feature introduced in pydantic 2.7.0 [Ability to pass a context object to the serialization methods](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/7143).\r\nContext dict containing `api_version` key is provided before sending payload automatically when using methods decorated with `@post`, `@put` etc.\r\nWhen model fields are annotated with `VersionedField` - model_serializer updates fields using helper when `api_version` is given in context.\r\n\r\n- introduce `VersionedField` annotation\r\n- introduce `update_model_fields()` helper\r\n- automatically inject context containing `api_version` when dumping model before payload is sent\r\n\r\n# Full usage example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom catalystwan.models.common import VersionedField\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, model_serializer\r\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated\r\nfrom catalystwan.endpoints import APIEndpoints, post\r\nfrom catalystwan.session import create_manager_session\r\n\r\n\r\n# 1. provide annotation with matching version specifier and desired serialization_alias\r\nclass TestPayload(BaseModel):\r\n    data: Annotated[\r\n        bool,\r\n        VersionedField(versions=\">=20.13,<20.15\", serialization_alias=\"dataForApiBefore-20.15\"),\r\n        VersionedField(versions=\">=20.15\", serialization_alias=\"dataForApiAfter-20.15\"),\r\n    ] = True\r\n\r\n    # 2. provide model_serializer which utilize helper\r\n    @model_serializer(mode=\"wrap\")\r\n    def serialize(self, handler, serialization_info):\r\n        return VersionedField.update_model_fields(self.model_fields, handler(self), serialization_info)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass CustomAPI(APIEndpoints):\r\n\r\n    @post(\"/test\")\r\n    def test_create(payload: TestPayload) -> None:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n\r\nwith create_manager_session(**login) as session:\r\n    api = CustomAPI(session)\r\n    api.test_create(payload=TestPayload()) # serialization alias is determined in runtime according to matching api version\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n- [x] Make sure to run pre-commit before committing changes\r\n- [x] Make sure all checks have passed\r\n- [x] PR
