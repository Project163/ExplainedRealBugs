Thank you for your contribution! -->\r\n<!-- Unless your change is trivial, please create an issue to discuss the change before creating a PR -->\r\n<!-- See https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/contributing/ for help on Contributing -->\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short summary of the changes. -->\r\n\r\nWhen built-in `dataclasses.dataclass` is detected and `pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass` is dynamically created for it, we should register it on module level with unique name to allow pickle work with it. Specific name (`_Pydantic...`) insures that there're no name collisions.\r\n\r\nNote: I've also tried another approach to manually handle pickle, by defining `__reduce__` for dynamically created class. `__reduce__` can be used to avoid register newly created class in globals(), by specifying how instance is pickled: one of the parameters can be function, that will recreate this class when needed (e.g. on `pickle.loads`) and create its instance. This works perfectly for simple cases, but here, `config` parameter is also a dynamically created class (fails to be pickled) so, the already complex problem only become bigger.\r\n\r\nℹ️ Regression introduced by #1817 in v1.7.0\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\n<!-- Are there any issues opened that will be resolved by merging this change? -->\r\ncloses

Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nSince the new serialization has been merged, deserialization fails to reconstruct `SubmittedBallot`s\r\n\r\nI'm trying to write the `SubmittedBallot`s to file. In order to create the tally, I deserialize the ballots with the `electionguard.serializer:from_file` function.\r\nBy doing this, the `ElgamalCiphertext` aka `ciphertext_accumulation` becomes different from the result of `elgamal_accumulate` function thus result in an invalid ballot that does not become part of the tally.\r\n\r\nthe `ciphertext_accumulation` is of type `__Pydantic_xxxxxxxx_ElgamalCiphertext` and there's no `__eq__` that can handle this by default.\r\n\r\nI see there are some `__eq__` functions defined in electionguard-python and they are all like:\r\n```python\r\ndef __eq__(self, other):\r\n    return (\r\n        isinstance(other, type)\r\n        and self.x == other.x\r\n        and self.y == other.y\r\n        ...\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is the default `__eq__` function that pydantic generates for `dataclasses`\r\n\r\nI suggest that all `dataclasses.dataclass` could be replaced by `pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass`\r\n\r\nPydantic handles the builtins `dataclass.field` with the same syntax and that would allow a working deserializing and generate the `__eq__` function so we could remove them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf not, we can add only the `__eq__` function for the `ElgamalCiphertext` class, that would help in my own case but I'm not sure that it would be very nice to help such a specific use case.\r\n\r\nWhat could I, in my case, if case dataclasses are not replaced, to deserialize my ballots except by recursively deserializing every class involved in such a ballot ?\r\nWhat would be the point in being able to serialize every single object in electionguard if deserialization don't work as one could expect?\r\n\r\nThat's why I think electionguard should use pydantic from start to end, not partly.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nuse the `electionguard.serialize:to_file` to write a `SubmittedBallot`\r\nuse the `electionguard.serialize:from_file` to load a `SubmittedBallot`\r\n\r\ncompare the ballot's `ciphertext_accumulation` with the result of its `elgamal_accumulate()` method\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- OS:\n```\n\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Election-Tech-Initiative/electionguard-python/issues/547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Election-Tech-Initiative/electionguard-python/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
