However, it is exactly why Pydantic exists and its job is to help developers dealing with this behavior. Here is why.\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct levels here:\r\n- Language\r\n- Library\r\n- Application\r\n\r\nIMO, `typing` is on the Language layer as type annotations cannot lie about language features. And when the language says that distinguishing between `str` and `Sequence[str]` is the developer's job it doesn't necessarily mean that it's an Application level's job. These common quality of life cases are exactly why there are libraries like `Pydantic` out there.\r\n\r\nThus, let's agree to leave this tedious job of making `if not isinstance(value, str)` check every time we write `Sequence[str]` to the Library level.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1525712022/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lig","id":38705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig","html_url":"https://github.com/lig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9114726621,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBWBCuM5kaMGozwAAAAIfR7Dd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/9114726621","actor":{"login":"Viicos","id":65306057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MzA2MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65306057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos","html_url":"https://github.com/Viicos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-27T13:37:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9114726637,"node_id":"SE_lADOBWBCuM5kaMGozwAAAAIfR7Dt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/9114726637","actor":{"login":"Viicos","id":65306057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MzA2MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65306057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos","html_url":"https://github.com/Viicos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Viicos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-27T13:37:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9114839612,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBWBCuM5kaMGozwAAAAIfSWo8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/9114839612","actor":{"login":"lig","id":38705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig","html_url":"https://github.com/lig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e2e6d9d4c95a542bc3fcca198dc9eb82f84f681f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/commits/e2e6d9d4c95a542bc3fcca198dc9eb82f84f681f","created_at":"2023-04-27T13:47:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1525869246","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/5595#issuecomment-1525869246","issue_url":"https://api
