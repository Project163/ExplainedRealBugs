to disagree\r\n\r\nimho the vast majority of programmers are interested in what I call camelCase (because they use pydantic for apis, which often enough means javascript with its naming convention, whereas PascalCase is rarely seen in apis these days).\r\n\r\nalso disliked the \"exercice is left to the reader\" approach\r\n\r\nthanks for clarifying it

Python version: 3.7.3\r\n* Pydantic version: 1.1\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nI've been struggling with getting this to work \"my way\".\r\nI have the below model which takes data from a source that I have no control over.\r\nMy use case is that I need to have this model returned as JSON but with camel cased output.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport pydantic\r\n\r\nclass Video(BaseModel):\r\n    secure_video_url: str = Field(None, alias=\"video:secure_url\")\r\n\r\nv = Video(**{\"video:secure_url\": \"http://example.com/video=123\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, getting it into the field is easy `secure_video_url = Field(None, alias=\"video:secure_url\")` and getting it out from the alias is also easy `v.json(by_alias=True)`.\r\nWhat I find myself struggling with is how to do `v.json()` and get something along the lines of `{\"secureVideoUrl\": \"http://example.com/video=123\"}`.\r\n\r\nI have read the following issues and PRs but have failed to get the output I need\r\n- https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/159\r\n- https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1056\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that you can only have 1 alias per field and that has left me thinking that either I should use a custom JSON encoder that transforms it (I would love not to) or write some logic around those aliases that have special case names and store that in the `Config` class of a base class.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1082/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2958908797,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5NTg5MDg3OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2958908797","actor":{"login":"andreshndz","id":57640881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjQwODgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57640881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz","html_url":"https://github.com/andreshndz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreshndz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7fb2e822091c0b038fff1120cb1a2b425b608962","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cuenca-mx/pydantic/commits/7fb2e822091c0b038fff1120cb1a2b425b608962","created_at":"2020-01-17T17:22:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
