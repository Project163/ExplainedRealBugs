Specifically, the issue is that `FrozenSet`, somewhat counter-intuitively, does not appear to be a subtype of `Set`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from typing import FrozenSet, Set\r\n>>> issubclass(FrozenSet, Set)\r\nFalse \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like this if-else block has to be amended with a specific case for `FrozenSet`.
