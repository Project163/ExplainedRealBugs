I would prefer not to re-annotate subclass class variables with `ClassVar[T]`.  I believe the following should also be interpret as a `ClassVar`, especially in conjunction with generic models (an uninitialised `ClassVar`):\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import ClassVar\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Foo(BaseModel):\r\n    class_var_to_be_defined_on_children: ClassVar[str]\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Bar(Foo):\r\n    class_var_to_be_defined_on_children = \"some other value\"\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2061/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
