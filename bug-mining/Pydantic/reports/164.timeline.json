Thank you for your contribution! -->\r\n<!-- See https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/#contributing-to-pydantic for help on Contributing -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry about making lots of commits on a pull request, they'll be squashed on merge anyway -->\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\nImplementation of advanced exclude support. With this changes you will be able to exclude any field on any depth of a model.\r\n* Changed exclude logic: now all values will be excluded in `_iter` (when dealing with BaseModel) and `_get_values` (when dealing with raw dicts and sequences) methods of model, not in `dict` or `copy` methods themselfs.\r\n* Yes, copy uses `_iter` and `_get_value` as well\r\n* ~~`_calculate_keys` replaced with `_update_exclude` which is calculating keys to exclude~~ (just modified `_calculate_keys` a bit to agree with changes)\r\n* added class `ValueItems` (used in `_get_value` and `_iter`) for more convenient calculation of excluded and included fields on values\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\n```python\r\nimport datetime\r\nfrom typing import List\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass

guess to implements this like [exporting roles in Schematics](https://schematics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/exporting.html#roles)\r\nThat mechanism is good for writing API's\r\n\r\nYou can simply describe all of public fields in model and inside controllers make dump in required set of fields by specifying only the role name.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n``` python3\r\nclass User(BaseModel):\r\n\tid: int\r\n\tlogin: str\r\n\temail: str\r\n\tpassword: str\r\n\tfirst_name: str\r\n\tlast_name: Optional[str] = None\r\n\tarticles: Optional[List[Article]] = None\r\n\r\n\tregister_date: datetime.datetime\r\n\tlast_login: Optional[datetime.datetime] = None\r\n\r\n\tclass Config:\r\n\t\troles = {\r\n\t\t\t\"self\": {\"exclude\": {\"password\", \"register_date\", \"last_login\"}},\r\n\t\t\t\"admin\": {\"exclude\": {\"password\"}},\r\n\t\t\t\"public\": {\"include\": {\"id\", \"email\", \"first_name\", \"last_name\"}}\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\nAnd then:\r\n```python3\r\nuser = User(\r\n\tid=42,\r\n\tlogin=\"mylogin\",\r\n\temail=\"email@example.com\",\r\n\tpassword=\"hashed secret password\",\r\n\tfirst_name=\"Some\",\r\n\tlast_name=\"User\",\r\n\tarticles=[Article(id=1, label=\"foo\"), Article(id=2, label=\"bar\"), ...],\r\n\tregister_date=datetime.datetime(...),\r\n\tlast_login=datetime.datetime.now()\r\n)\r\nuser.dump(role=\"public\")\r\n```\r\nShould return something like this:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"id\": 42,\r\n\t\"email\": \"email@example.com\",\r\n\t\"first_name\": \"Some\",\r\n\t\"last_name\": \"User\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ninclude/exclude describing mechanism can be implemented more simply, for e.g. via function `include(...)`/`exclude(...)`","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/511350570/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JrooTJunior","id":6726423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjY0MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6726423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior","html_url":"https://github.com/JrooTJunior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JrooTJunior/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/511531486","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/660#issuecomment-511531486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/660","id":511531486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTUzMTQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"enkoder","id":989096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/989096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder","html_url":"https://github.com/enkoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enkoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T19:10:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T19:10:25Z","body":"Wow
