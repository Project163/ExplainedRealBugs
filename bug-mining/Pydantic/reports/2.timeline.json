after looking at #218 I propose the following way to deal with this:\r\n\r\n`type` becomes a dictionary. \r\n\r\nFor \"simple\" fields, eg. just an int or float, type like:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n'type': {\r\n  'item_type': 'float',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor unions we'd have:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n'type': {\r\n  'mode': 'any_of',\r\n  'item_type': ['str', 'float'],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor things like `List[int]` we'd have:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n'type': {\r\n  'item_type': 'int',\r\n  'shape': 'list',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nor `List[Union[int, str]]` we'd have:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n'type': {\r\n  'mode': 'any_of',\r\n  'item_type': ['int', 'str'],\r\n  'shape': 'list',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `Dict[str, int]` we'd have:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n'type': {\r\n  'item_type': 'int',\r\n  'key_type': 'str',\r\n  'shape': 'dict',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(we could add `key_mode` if the key is a union, but that's a very rare case)\r\n\r\nThe names `mode`, `item_type` and `shape` are not great (suggestions very welcome), but I think this is the best way to go.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* are their any case's I've missed?\r\n* do we do `type: {'item_type': 'int', ...}` or just add all these items to the main dict?\r\n* what do we do when implement tuples #12, I guess something like `properties` on sub models?\r\n* what do we do with `Union[int, FoobarModel]` - I guess we have `type` as above, then `properties`. What do we do with `Union[FooModel, BarModel]` - maybe this is just banned?\r\n\r\n@Gr1N
