about to publish \"a thing\" for managing tool panel views by utilizing data about tools from many sources and the process of thinking through how to apply these across multiple servers and in multiple contexts has made a couple initial shortcomings for a very obvious use case clear. This is pull request fixes those up and includes tests.\r\n\r\nTwo related use cases - name \"I have a list of deprecated tools I want to hide from selected sections\" and \"I have a list of deprecated tools I just want to apply to the original tool panel\" - are both now pretty and natural and were pretty awkward before.\r\n\r\nThe first commit allows the list of exclusion criteria applied to the root of the panel apply to sections as well. This allows effectively global exclusions of tools - by ID, regex, etc.. Previously if you wanted to exclude say TopHat - you'd need to know a priori what each section it is in and apply the filter there. Sections may have different names, IDs, etc.. across servers so this can be hard to apply in a uniform fashion across multiple servers.\r\n\r\nThe second commit allows the root panel view to just not contain a set of items to describe this view. In this case the default is a description of the integrated tool panel. Combined with the first change - this allows very simple filters that just exclude tools and apply to any tool panel.\r\n\r\nIdeally we could get this merged before 21.09 😇🙏 .\r\n\r\n## How to test the changes?\r\n(Select all options that apply)\r\n- [x] I've included appropriate [automated tests](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/dev/writing_tests.html).\r\n- [x] This is a refactoring of components with existing test coverage.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n- [x] I agree to license these contributions under [Galaxy's current license](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/LICENSE.txt).\r\n- [x] I agree to allow the Galaxy committers to license these and all my past contributions to the core galaxy codebase under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
