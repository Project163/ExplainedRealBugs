I know you explicitly addressed this in your original post, but I think it might be worth revisiting one of the assumptions -- is `allow_population_by_alias` really that problematic? I know the pydantic docs have a big red warning about it, but as long as your aliases are just camelcased versions of the attributes (and they have non-pathological names), I'm having a hard time imagining a real-world scenario where the potential collision would actually cause problems. (Maybe I'm not thinking hard enough?)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I use the following `APIModel` as a base class for any model interfacing with external clients:\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\ndef snake2camel(snake: str, start_lower: bool = False) -> str:\r\n    camel = snake.title()\r\n    camel = re.sub(\"([0-9A-Za-z])_(?=[0-9A-Z])\", lambda m: m.group(1), camel)\r\n    if start_lower:\r\n        camel = re.sub(\"(^_*[A-Z])\", lambda m: m.group(1).lower(), camel)\r\n    return camel\r\n\r\nclass APIModel(BaseModel):\r\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\r\n        allow_population_by_alias = True\r\n\r\n        @classmethod\r\n        def get_field_schema(cls, name: str) -> Dict[str, str]:\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            Generate a camelCase alias\r\n            \"\"\"\r\n            field_config = super().get_field_schema(name) or {}\r\n            if \"alias\" not in field_config:\r\n                field_config[\"alias\"] = snake2camel(name, start_lower=True)\r\n            return field_config\r\n```\r\nRelying on a generated alias means I can be confident I'm not accidentally/carelessly manually generating collisions, and so far I have never run into a situation where converting to camel case could introduce ambiguity.\r\n\r\nUsing the above model means the service is always interfacing externally in camelcase, but I can always use snake case when writing python. (I'm not bothered by the fact that external clients can choose to use snake case if they want to, but maybe I should be?)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/503969854/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2426937453,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQyNjkzNzQ1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2426937453","actor":{"login":"m-burst","id":3243475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDM0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3243475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst","html_url":"https://github.com/m-burst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-20T10:19:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2426937454,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MjY5Mzc0NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2426937454","actor":{"login":"m-burst","id":3243475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDM0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3243475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst","html_url":"https://github.com/m-burst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m-burst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-20T10:19:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/503974548","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/585#issuecomment-503974548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/585","id":503974548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMzk3NDU0OA==","user":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-20T10:35:40Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T10:48:18Z","body":"Alternatively,
