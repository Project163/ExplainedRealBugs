so what happens is DBUser gets encoded with the custom encoder for User. DBUser doesn't have the same fields and thus the .json throws an error. Neither object is a descendant of the other one they just share the same value for \\_\\_name\\_\\_. \r\n\r\nThis is the code causing the issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/ef4678999f94625819ebad61b44ea264479aeb0a/pydantic/json.py#L100-L113\r\n\r\nWe are checking the field  \\_\\_name\\_\\_ all classes get their name at class definition time. They are not guaranteed to be unique between files or modules. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the only use of checking  \\_\\_name\\_\\_ is so that a class's encoder can reference the class's type.

I've created a fix for this #3595, should have the secondary effect of making validation a little bit faster by removing the need to check by name as well.\r\n\r\n@zrothberg could you review the PR and check what you think.\r\n\r\nIf you have a better fix, feel free to create another PR. If you have some additional tests to add, add a link to them in the PR and I'll add them and credit you in the fix.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1002766528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5826002567,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBWBCuM5A5-3gzwAAAAFbQb6H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/5826002567","actor":{"login":"zrothberg","id":13908315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTA4MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13908315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg","html_url":"https://github.com/zrothberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-29T20:31:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5826002569,"node_id":"SE_lADOBWBCuM5A5-3gzwAAAAFbQb6J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/5826002569","actor":{"login":"zrothberg","id":13908315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTA4MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13908315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg","html_url":"https://github.com/zrothberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-29T20:31:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1002800392","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3583#issuecomment-1002800392","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3583","id":1002800392,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBWBCuM47xYUI","user":{"login":"zrothberg","id":13908315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTA4MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13908315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg","html_url":"https://github.com/zrothberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zrothberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-29T22:36:26Z","upd
