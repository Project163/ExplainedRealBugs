This is one of most well-documented (also concise) Open Source Project that I have encountered so far. Thank you for great work so far. \r\n\r\nI am looking at documentation of 2 options:\r\n```\r\nignore_extra: | whether to ignore any extra values in input data (default: True)\r\nallow_extra: | whether or not too allow (and include on the model) any extra values in input data (default: False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may be able to improve clarity of distinctions between these 2 options.\r\nAt first glance, `allow_extra` and `ignore_extra` options have quite a bit overlapping. \r\n\r\nBased on my own trials of these 2 configuration options (4 combinations): \r\n```\r\n    class Config: \r\n        ignore_extra = True    \t\r\n        allow_extra = False\r\n```\r\nThis combination makes sense by dropping any extra fields from the input data. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    class Config: \r\n        ignore_extra = False   \t\r\n        allow_extra = True\r\n```\r\nAs far as I can tell, allow_extra essentially overrides ignore_extra behavior. \r\nNo ValidationError would be raised. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    class Config: \r\n        ignore_extra = True    \t\r\n        allow_extra = True\r\n```\r\nAs far as I can tell, allow_extra essentially overrides ignore_extra behavior. \r\nAny extra field from input data would be stored in the target Python data object. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    class Config: \r\n        ignore_extra = False\r\n        allow_extra = False\r\n```\r\n(Trivial) ValidationError would be raised. \r\n\r\nMaybe, we can consider the following wordings in the documentation: \r\n```\r\nignore_extra: | whether to ignore any extra values in input data; if this option is set to be true, any extra attributes will be dropped without raising a ValidationError (default: True)\r\nallow_extra: | whether or not to allow (and include on the model) any extra values from input data to be stored as attributes of Python data object; when allow_extra option is set to be true, that will essentially override ignore_extra option  (default: False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\nThanks again. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/301/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
