Initial Checks\r\n\r\n- [X] I confirm that I'm using Pydantic V2\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is somewhere in-between a feature request and a bug report, but judging from the systematic analysis below, it feels like something isn't quite right with the alias system.\r\n\r\nConsider the most basic use case of renaming a field. The goals are:\r\n\r\n- Within Python code the field should be named e.g. `internal` consistently. This includes field access `my_instance.internal` and the class constructor `MyModel(internal=42)`. Type checkers like mypy/pyright should consider `internal` as the correct identifier in all Python code.\r\n- To the outside the field should be called e.g. `\"external\"`. This includes all the usages of `model_validate` + `model_validate_json` in validation direction and `model_dump` + `model_dump_json` in serialization direction.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a very fundamental use case, because it makes sense that a name is decoupled in code from its external form in the payload -- but consistent within the two worlds.\r\n\r\nFrom my systematic assessment it looks like neither `alias=\"...\"`, `serialization_alias=\"...\"`, `validation_alias=\"...\"` nor combinations with `populate_by_name` seem to cover this use case. The following demo code actually constructs all either possible combinations of using\r\n\r\n- only `alias=\"external\"`\r\n- only `serialization_alias=\"external\"`\r\n- only `alias=\"external\"`\r\n- both `serialization_alias=\"external\"` and `validation_alias=\"external\"`\r\n\r\nand combines them further with both variations of `populate_by_name` enabled and disabled. In none of the the 8 variations the above goals seems to be achievable. The output of the snippet is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChecking: WithAlias\r\n ✓  works | WithAlias.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | WithAlias.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n 🛇  fails | instance = WithAlias(internal=42)\r\n\r\nChecking: WithSerializationAlias\r\n 🛇  fails | WithSerializationAlias.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n 🛇  fails | WithSerializationAlias.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | instance = WithSerializationAlias(internal=42)\r\n          | instance.model_dump()      => {'internal': 42}\r\n          | instance.model_dump_json() => {\"internal\":42}\r\n\r\nChecking: WithValidationAlias\r\n ✓  works | WithValidationAlias.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | WithValidationAlias.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n 🛇  fails | instance = WithValidationAlias(internal=42)\r\n\r\nChecking: WithBoth\r\n ✓  works | WithBoth.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | WithBoth.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n 🛇  fails | instance = WithBoth(internal=42)\r\n\r\nChecking: WithAliasPopByName\r\n ✓  works | WithAliasPopByName.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | WithAliasPopByName.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | instance = WithAliasPopByName(internal=42)\r\n          | instance.model_dump()      => {'internal': 42}\r\n          | instance.model_dump_json() => {\"internal\":42}\r\n\r\nChecking: WithSerializationAliasPopByName\r\n 🛇  fails | WithSerializationAliasPopByName.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n 🛇  fails | WithSerializationAliasPopByName.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | instance = WithSerializationAliasPopByName(internal=42)\r\n          | instance.model_dump()      => {'internal': 42}\r\n          | instance.model_dump_json() => {\"internal\":42}\r\n\r\nChecking: WithValidationAliasPopByName\r\n ✓  works | WithValidationAliasPopByName.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | WithValidationAliasPopByName.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | instance = WithValidationAliasPopByName(internal=42)\r\n          | instance.model_dump()      => {'internal': 42}\r\n          | instance.model_dump_json() => {\"internal\":42}\r\n\r\nChecking: WithBothPopByName\r\n ✓  works | WithBothPopByName.model_validate({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | WithBothPopByName.model_validate_json({'external': 42})\r\n ✓  works | instance = WithBothPopByName(internal=42)\r\n          | instance.model_dump()      => {'internal': 42}\r\n          | instance.model_dump_json() => {\"internal\":42}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n- None of the variants serializes the data under the alias name. Shouldn't that be the case for the variants that use `serialization_alias` and probably also for the basic `alias` variant?\r\n- Some constructors calls work with the `internal` name (those without `validation_alias` and the ones with `populate_by_name`) at runtime, others fail. Curiously the type checkers don't get the runtime semantics right. See the necessary `# type: ignore` for things that mypy is complaining about and `# pyright: ignore` for usages only complained about by pyright. It looks like mypy only has false negatives, while pyright also sees some false positives.\r\n\r\nNote that swapping the roles of `internal` and `external` also does not satisfy the renaming requirement, because then field access has to happen under the \"wrong\" name, i.e., the Python code doesn't use `internal` consistently.\r\n\r\n### Example Code\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom typing import Callable\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field, ValidationError\r\n\r\n# All combinations of `alias` variations and `populate_by_name`\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithAlias(BaseModel):\r\n    internal: int = Field(alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithSerializationAlias(BaseModel):\r\n    internal: int = Field(serialization_alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithValidationAlias(BaseModel):\r\n    internal: int = Field(validation_alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithBoth(BaseModel):\r\n    internal: int = Field(serialization_alias=\"external\", validation_alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithAliasPopByName(BaseModel):\r\n    model_config = ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True)\r\n    internal: int = Field(alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithSerializationAliasPopByName(BaseModel):\r\n    model_config = ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True)\r\n    internal: int = Field(serialization_alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithValidationAliasPopByName(BaseModel):\r\n    model_config = ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True)\r\n    internal: int = Field(validation_alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass WithBothPopByName(BaseModel):\r\n    model_config = ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True)\r\n    internal: int = Field(serialization_alias=\"external\", validation_alias=\"external\")\r\n\r\n\r\ndef check(model: type[BaseModel], factory: Callable[[], BaseModel]) -> None:\r\n    name = model.__name__\r\n    print(f\"\\nChecking: {name}\")\r\n\r\n    works = \" ✓  works |\"\r\n    fails = \" 🛇  fails |\"\r\n    dummy = \" \" * (len(works) - 1) + \"|\"\r\n\r\n    data = {\"external\": 42}\r\n    try:\r\n        instance_deser = model.model_validate({\"external\": 42})\r\n        print(f\"{works} {name}.model_validate({data})\")\r\n    except ValidationError:\r\n        print(f\"{fails} {name}.model_validate({data})\")\r\n\r\n    data = {\"external\": 42}\r\n    try:\r\n        instance_deser = model.model_validate_json('{\"external\": 42}')\r\n        print(f\"{works} {name}.model_validate_json({data})\")\r\n    except ValidationError:\r\n        print(f\"{fails} {name}.model_validate_json({data})\")\r\n\r\n    try:\r\n        instance = factory()\r\n        print(f\"{works} instance = {name}(internal=42)\")\r\n    except ValidationError:\r\n        print(f\"{fails} instance = {name}(internal=42)\")\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    print(f\"{dummy} instance.model_dump()      => {instance.model_dump()}\")\r\n    print(f\"{dummy} instance.model_dump_json() => {instance.model_dump_json()}\")\r\n\r\n\r\n# Variants without `populate_by_name`\r\ncheck(WithAlias, lambda: WithAlias(internal=42))  # type: ignore\r\ncheck(WithSerializationAlias, lambda: WithSerializationAlias(internal=42))\r\ncheck(WithValidationAlias, lambda: WithValidationAlias(internal=42))\r\ncheck(WithBoth, lambda: WithBoth(internal=42))\r\n\r\n# Variants with `populate_by_name`\r\ncheck(WithAliasPopByName, lambda: WithAliasPopByName(internal=42))  # pyright: ignore\r\ncheck(WithSerializationAliasPopByName, lambda: WithSerializationAliasPopByName(internal=42))\r\ncheck(WithValidationAliasPopByName, lambda: WithValidationAliasPopByName(internal=42))\r\ncheck(WithBothPopByName, lambda: WithBothPopByName(internal=42))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Python, Pydantic & OS Version\r\n\r\n```Text\r\npydantic version: 2.5.3\r\n        pydantic-core version: 2.14.6\r\n          pydantic-core build: profile=release pgo=true\r\n                 install path: /home/me/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pydantic\r\n               python version: 3.10.13 (main, Aug 25 2023, 13:20:03) [GCC 9.4.0]\r\n                     platform: Linux-5.4.0-166-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.31\r\n             related packages: typing_extensions-4.9.0 mypy-1.8.0\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8551/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
