As explained in the issue, it should be supported by _pydantic_ and `None`, `NoneType` (aka `type(None)`) or `Literal[None]` should all be considered as equal as other tools do.\r\nI know there may be some debate on this syntax\r\n```python\r\nclass Model(BaseModel):\r\n    my_field: None\r\n```\r\nbut IMO we should be consistent everywhere.
