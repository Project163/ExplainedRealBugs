One of the features described in PEP 681 is the ability to describe a set of custom \"field specifier\" classes. In an early version of PEP 681, these were specified using a parameter named `field_descriptors`, but based on feedback the parameter name was changed to `field_specifiers` for the final version of the PEP. Pydantic is still using the (now obsolete) parameter name.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/3912 for details.\n\n### Example Code\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python, Pydantic & OS Version\n\n```Text\nPython 3.11\r\nPydantic 1.10.2\n```\n\n\n### Affected Components\n\n- [ ] [Compatibility between releases](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/changelog/)\n- [ ] [Data validation/parsing](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#basic-model-usage)\n- [ ] [Data serialization](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/exporting_models/) - `.dict()` and `.json()`\n- [ ] [JSON Schema](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/schema/)\n- [ ] [Dataclasses](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/)\n- [ ] [Model Config](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/model_config/)\n- [X] [Field Types](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/) - adding or changing a particular data type\n- [ ] [Function validation decorator](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validation_decorator/)\n- [ ] [Generic Models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#generic-models)\n- [X] [Other Model behaviour](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) - `construct()`, pickling, private attributes, ORM mode\n- [ ] [Settings Management](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/)\n- [ ] [Plugins](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and integration with other tools - mypy, FastAPI, python-devtools, Hypothesis, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4500/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
