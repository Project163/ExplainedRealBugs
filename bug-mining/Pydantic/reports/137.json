Just checking here in case anyone else has feedback.\r\n\r\n# Feature Request\r\n\r\nPydantic already has types `PositiveFloat`, `NegativeFloat`, `PositiveInt`, `NegativeInt`.\r\nThese values all exclude zero.\r\n\r\nI want to have a class that allows all positive numbers, including zero.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nAfter eyeballing [types.py](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/e985857e5a9ede8d346b010a5a039aa84a089826/pydantic/types.py#L429) I think we should have:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nclass NonPositiveFloat(ConstrainedFloat):\r\n    le = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NonNegativeFloat(ConstrainedFloat):\r\n    ge = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NonPositiveInt(ConstrainedInt):\r\n    le = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NonNegativeInt(ConstrainedInt):\r\n    ge = 0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes I know the end user can do that. This just seems like the kind of thing that's probably quite common, so would be nice out of the box.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm not sure about is the capitalisation. `NonPositiveInt` or `NonpositiveInt`?","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1975/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1975/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
