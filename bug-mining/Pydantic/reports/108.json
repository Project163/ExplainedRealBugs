Well, I'm writing a package that automatically introspect classes and all their members to output structured data in JSON (it's `pytkdocs`, used by `mkdocstrings` to bring autodoc for MkDocs, and `pytkdocs` tries to support Pydantic models).\r\n\r\nI'm just reporting for the sake of it. Maybe there's an easy fix? Maybe it's a bug in Python's `typing`? Maybe it's expected because `SchemaExtraCallable` is a forward ref in this context?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm catching the error for now, so it's fine if you want to close the issue :slightly_smiling_face: ","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
