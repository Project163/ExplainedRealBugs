the bug**\r\nIf the api response contains fields of type `pathlib.Path`, an error is raised:\r\n \r\n```bash\r\nValueError: [KeyError(<class 'pathlib.PosixPath'>,), TypeError(\"'PosixPath' object is not iterable\",), TypeError('vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute',)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI wrote a test for this bug which fails with the above ^ error.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#tests/test_serialize_path.py\r\n\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\nfrom starlette.testclient import TestClient\r\n\r\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ContainsPathProperty(BaseModel):\r\n    path: Path\r\n\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI()\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.get(\"/\", response_model=ContainsPathProperty)\r\nasync def get_main():\r\n    obj = ContainsPathProperty(path=Path('/some/random/path'))\r\n    return obj\r\n\r\n\r\nclient = TestClient(app)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_serialize_path():\r\n    response = client.get(\"/\")\r\n    assert response.status_code == 200\r\n    assert response.json() == {'path': '/some/random/path'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe test should pass, which means a 200 response is returned and the response is:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"path\": \"/some/random/path\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - OS: Linux / Windows\r\n - FastAPI Version 0.38.1\r\n\r\n- Python version 3.6.9\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n**Solution 1**\r\n\r\nA possible fix would be importing and using the encoder from `pydantic` which knows to encode `Path` objects:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pydantic/json.py\r\n\r\ndef pydantic_encoder(obj: Any) -> Any:\r\n    ......\r\n    elif isinstance(obj, Path):\r\n        return str(obj)\r\n    ......\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Fastapi's `jsonable_encoder(....)` would be changed from this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# fastapi/encoder.py\r\n....\r\nfrom pydantic.json import ENCODERS_BY_TYPE\r\n....\r\n\r\ndef jsonable_encoder(....) -> Any:\r\n    .......\r\n    try:\r\n        if custom_encoder and type(obj) in custom_encoder:\r\n            encoder = custom_encoder[type(obj)]\r\n        else:\r\n            encoder = ENCODERS_BY_TYPE[type(obj)]\r\n        return encoder(obj)\r\n    except KeyError as e:\r\n        .....\r\n    ......\r\n```\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# fastapi/encoder.py\r\n....\r\nfrom pydantic.json import pydantic_encoder\r\n....\r\n\r\ndef jsonable_encoder(....) -> Any:\r\n    .......\r\n    try:\r\n        if custom_encoder and type(obj) in custom_encoder:\r\n            encoder = custom_encoder[type(obj)]\r\n        else:\r\n            encoder = pydantic_encoder\r\n        return encoder(obj)\r\n    except KeyError as e:\r\n        .....\r\n    ......\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test passes but `pydantic_encoder()` has a downside: the string obtained by `str(Path(...))` is not the same on Windows (eg: `\\some\\random\\path`) vs Linux (`/some/random/path`).\r\n\r\n** Solution 2 **\r\n\r\nAs I think it is very important that a Fastapi app return the same responses no matter the platform on which it's deployed, another solution is handling the `pathlib.Path` encoding directly in Fastapi's `jsonable_encoder()`, using `Path(...).as_posix()` instead of `str(Path(...))` like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# fastapi/encoders.py\r\n\r\ndef jsonable_encoder(.....) -> Any:\r\n    ......\r\n    if isinstance(obj, Path):\r\n        return obj.as_posix()\r\n    .......\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastapi/fastapi/issues/563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastapi/fastapi/issues/563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/2310701038","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/473#issuecomment-2310701038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/473","id":2310701038,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBWBCuM6Jun_u","user":{"login":"sevetseh28","id":13895313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODk1MzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13895313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28","html_url":"https://github.com/sevetseh28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sevetseh28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-26T17:24:31Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T17:24:31Z","body":"How
