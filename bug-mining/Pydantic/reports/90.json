In my case I want to store some data in model class object that I want to use for validation and I cannot get it via `cls` because `cls` is None. Of course I can use model class object directly, but this behavior is ambiguous and looks like a bug anyway.\r\n\r\nOutput of `python -c \"import pydantic.utils; print(pydantic.utils.version_info())\"`:\r\n```\r\n         pydantic version: 1.3\r\n        pydantic compiled: False\r\n             install path: C:\\Users\\espdev\\AppData\\Local\\pypoetry\\Cache\\virtualenvs\\ms3eI9mF-py3.8\\Lib\\site-packages\\pydantic\r\n           python version: 3.8.1 (tags/v3.8.1:1b293b6, Dec 18 2019, 23:11:46) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\n                 platform: Windows-10-10.0.18362-SP0\r\n optional deps. installed: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nA minimal example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, StrictStr, validator\r\n\r\nclass Model(BaseModel):\r\n    name: StrictStr\r\n\r\n    class Config:\r\n        validate_assignment = True\r\n\r\n    @validator('name')\r\n    def _validate_foo(cls, value):\r\n        if cls is None:\r\n            raise ValueError('cls is None')\r\n        return value\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    m = Model(name='hello')  # OK\r\n    m.name = 'goodbye'       # <-- ValidationError \"cls is None\"\r\n```\r\n```\r\npydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for Model\r\nname\r\n  cls is None (type=value_error)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1172/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1172/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
