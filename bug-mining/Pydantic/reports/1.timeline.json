was something like `Foo.ignore_missing(foo=1)` ever implemented? I'd love a way to take off the guard-rails and type and use a model that allows me to annotate model fields as all required but allows for missing values at runtime.\r\n\r\nIn my use-case, I'm defining a model for a response that could contain many different keys, and those keys are dependent on what's specified in the request. So if I know the response is returned without error, I know which keys are present in the response. Technically all of the fields should be `Optional`, but in practice I only care about whether I'm handling the underlying datatype right, not whether the value is present. mypy is a bother, telling me to check for `None` every time I access a field.\r\n\r\nMaybe a way to specify validation errors to ignore would work (e.g. `value_error.missing`)?\r\n\r\nedit: In the meantime I'm just using

really like the idea of having a way to load unsafe data and a way to load safe data (`Model(**unsafe)` and `Model.construct(**safe)`), but in practical use it has come to my attention that construct might be a bit of a half measure.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to be able to explicitly control is whether defaults are loaded, validators are run and perhaps a new concept of constructors that always run regardless of whether the data is safe or unsafe. For instance, nested models do not get parsed and instantiated when loaded via `Model.construct`, so code that relies on those being objects instead of dictionaries will break. Basically anytime you would want mutating functions run on fields loaded into the model regardless of data cleanliness, you would define a constructor and those would always be run and not raise errors.\r\n\r\nA good example of a type that could do for a construct function instead of validate is SecretStr. The value is simply mutated and should happen regardless of data cleanliness.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nclass SecretStr:\r\n\r\n    # the current method that needs to be run through validation to occur\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def validate(cls, value: Any) -> 'SecretStr':\r\n        if isinstance(value, cls):\r\n            return value\r\n        value = str_validator(value)\r\n        return cls(value)\r\n\r\n    # potential method that would always run\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def construct(cls, value: Any) -> 'SecretStr':\r\n        if isinstance(value, cls):\r\n            return value\r\n        return cls(value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of the construct method on the model, I propose keyword arguments to `__init__` that would enable/disable validation and defaults but never allow disabling constructors. e.g. `Model(**data, run_validation=False, set_defaults=True)`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1926/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11331393039,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBWBCuM4UJUkgzwAAAAKjZ1YP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/11331393039","actor":{"login":"alexdrydew","id":39103632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTAzNjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39103632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew","html_url":"https://github.com/alexdrydew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexdrydew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"741cd85ee4ff1015fff1794948dac0cd57795a2c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alexdrydew/pydantic/commits/741cd85ee4ff1015fff1794948dac0cd57795a2c","created_at":"2023-12-23T20:09:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
