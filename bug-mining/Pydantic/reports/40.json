But it's very desirable to construct BaseModel object from another BaseModel objects.\r\n\r\nThis is my case:\r\nI have a webhook which is used for whole protocol. All different data types are passed as json body.\r\n```py\r\n@app.route(\"/\", methods=['POST'])\r\nasync def telegram_webhook(request):\r\n    update = Update.parse_obj(request.json)\r\n    /* do something with update */\r\n```\r\nI use Update model for validation (which is used are base validation):\r\n```py\r\nclass Update(BaseModel):\r\n    update_id: int\r\n    message: Optional[Message]\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nclass Message(BaseModel):\r\n    message_id: int\r\n    text: Optional[str]\r\n```\r\nBut later, I want to apply additional validation to Message (so to check that it is TextMessage and to convert to it):\r\n```py\r\nclass TextMessage(Message):\r\n    text: str # Now is required\r\n\r\n    @validator('text')\r\n    def check_text_length(cls, value):\r\n        length = len(value)\r\n        if length > 4096:\r\n            raise ValueError(f'text length {length} is too large')\r\n        return value\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I get Message object in function and get expection:\r\n```\r\ndef process_text_message(message):\r\n    text_message = TextMessage.parse_obj(message)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to solve this?\r\nIt would be great, if I could get entry dict, convert it to BaseModel object and process all validation / conversions / etc through BaseModel, without conversions to dict. And at the end, as last step, to convert it back to dict (for example to insert into MongoDB)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
