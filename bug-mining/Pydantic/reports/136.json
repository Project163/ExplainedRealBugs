But when the config flag `underscore_attrs_are_private` is set to `True`, the model's `__doc__` attribute also becomes a private attribute. Example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pydantic import BaseModel\r\n>>> class MyModel(BaseModel):\r\n...     \"\"\"MyModel docsting.\"\"\"\r\n...     class Config:\r\n...         underscore_attrs_are_private = True\r\n...\r\n>>> MyModel.__doc__\r\n<member '__doc__' of 'MyModel' objects>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to define a new metaclass to handle the issue:\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pydantic import BaseModel\r\n>>> from pydantic.main import ModelMetaclass\r\n>>> from pydantic.fields import ModelPrivateAttr\r\n>>> class DocPreservingModelMetaclass(ModelMetaclass):\r\n...     def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs):\r\n...         cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs)\r\n...         if cls.__config__.underscore_attrs_are_private:\r\n...             doc = cls.__private_attributes__.pop('__doc__', None)\r\n...             if isinstance(doc, ModelPrivateAttr):\r\n...                 cls.__doc__ = doc.default\r\n...         return cls\r\n...\r\n>>> class MyModel(BaseModel, metaclass=DocPreservingModelMetaclass):\r\n...     \"\"\"MyModel docsting.\"\"\"\r\n...     class Config:\r\n...         underscore_attrs_are_private = True\r\n...\r\n>>> MyModel.__doc__\r\n'MyModel docsting.'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut maybe it would be best if `__doc__` was excluded via `pydantic.utils.is_valid_private_name`, much like the other standard properties are excluded through this method. However, I am not sure if the latter will have other implication in the current codebase.","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
