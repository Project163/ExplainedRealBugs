this is really interesting, I've copied this to a new issue to separate it from discussions around `attr` benchmarks/\r\n\r\nIs there any easy way for you share your result from profiling? This is something I've been intending to do for a year or so but haven't had the time to sit down and concentrate on it. If we can easily benefit from your work without having to start from scratch that would be great.\r\n\r\nRegarding cythonizing, I'd be very keen to add this to the pypi release, my initial thoughts/concerns:\r\n* we need to keep pydantic working identically with and without cython, either by:\r\n  * duplicating code in `.py` and `.pyx`, if so we should minimise the amount of duplicated code\r\n  * or by modifying python code to be cython friendly but still valid python. What's the current recommendation on this?\r\n* we should include manylinux binaries to make installs fast for the majority of users. According to [this](https://pypistats.org/packages/pydantic) windows installs are less than 1%, but maybe that's not correct and some of the `system=null` installs are actually windows? Either way windows binaries are too much hassle for me, at least

ah yes, I tried to cythonize main.py but I think I ran into precisely the issue you are describing, I can't remember if I was able to work around it.\r\n\r\nOne thing I remember noticing from the line profiler was that [this](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/master/pydantic/main.py#L586) check in particular was eating a couple % of execution time, despite being basically irrelevant after model definition. But it looks like that was removed in the cython branch.\r\n\r\nI had to hack the codebase to get the line profiler working due in part to conflicts with built-in names (in particular, I think the presence of a file called `profile.py` next to the benchmark was causing some conflicts). Sadly I nuked my profiler setup but it shouldn't be hard to put it back together.

Here is the output of the line-profiler running the benchmark on my computer: https://gist.github.com/dmontagu/0a8b823c2c5dec3954405a921028f7dd.\r\n\r\n* `profile_all.log` has more functions being line-profiled (as it is set up in #551)\r\n* `profile_last_layer.log` has only the \"last layer\" of functions being line-profiled (basically just commenting out where I added the other functions to the line profiler), so has less \"noise\" in the output\r\n\r\nIf you look at the code in #551 I think it should be clear how to modify to run it on different functions if you want to profile others.
