I wanted to ask if it's feasible to have `__iter__` and `__getitem__` automatically implemented when using custom root types. At the moment this has to be done manually, as shown in the following example. If not, would it be possible to add this example to the docs?\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import List, Dict\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError\r\n\r\nclass Pets(BaseModel):\r\n    __root__: List[str]\r\n\r\n    def __iter__(self):\r\n        return iter(self.__root__)\r\n\r\n    def __getitem__(self, item):\r\n        return self.__root__[item]\r\n\r\n\r\npets = Pets.parse_obj(['dog', 'cat'])\r\nprint(pets[0])\r\n#> dog\r\nprint([pet for pet in pets])\r\n#> ['dog', 'cat']\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1372/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
