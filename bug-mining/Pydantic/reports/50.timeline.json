though.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/496274849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zbarry","id":4762711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjI3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4762711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry","html_url":"https://github.com/zbarry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2371075681,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzNzEwNzU2ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2371075681","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-28T08:58:03Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2371075685,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzNzEwNzU2ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2371075685","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-28T08:58:03Z","label":{"name":"help

It wouldn't surprise me if this is due to differences in `typing` in python 3.6 and 3.7. In particular, I know inherting from `typing.Generic` used to change the metaclass, which made it hard/impossible to create custom generic classes with more interesting metaclasses. So maybe the mechanics of the generics/TypeVars changed and that's why this is happening now.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/496759281/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2373684272,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM3MzY4NDI3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2373684272","actor":{"login":"zbarry","id":4762711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjI3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4762711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry","html_url":"https://github.com/zbarry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-29T02:29:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2373684273,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNzM2ODQyNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2373684273","actor":{"login":"zbarry","id":4762711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjI3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4762711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry","html_url":"https://github.com/zbarry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zbarry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-29T02:29:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2376044377,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNzYwNDQzNzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/2376044377","actor":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8afcad21188a30887bb53c10f9f7f9a688955999","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmontagu/pydantic/commits/8afcad21188a30887bb53c10f9f7f9a688955999","created_at":"2019-05-29T18:27:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2376068788,"node_id":"MDExOkNs
