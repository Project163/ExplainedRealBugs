SQLModel and Alembic libraries, but it can be ealisy reproduced without the use of those libraries.\r\n\r\nIn general, when I am importing my models in Alembic's `env.py` file and then run the automatic revision generation, I get the error:\r\n`RuntimeError: error checking inheritance of 'ServerConfig' (type: str)`\r\nIt is caused by using the generic alias type `list[\"ServerConfig\"]`. When I import the `List` from the `typing` and then use it instead, everything works fine.\r\nWhy am I using a string as a type annotation? To prevent the circular imports as described at [SQLModel: Type Annotations and Runtime](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/code-structure/#type-annotations-and-runtime)\r\n\r\nTo simplify things, I have created the MRE and published it as a repo: https://github.com/sz3lbi/pydantic_generic_alias_types_bug\r\nWhen you run the `ok.py` file, everything works as expected and running the `error.py` causes the `RuntimeError`. To simulate the Alembic imports, I am importing models inside the `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\nThe only information I have found about the bug is this comment on the Pydantic's GitHub: https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2132#issuecomment-1012686279\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3879/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/3879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1292643921","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2132#issuecomment-1292643921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2132","id":1292643921,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBWBCuM5NDC5R","user":{"login":"igorkf","id":47466755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDY2NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47466755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf","html_url":"https://github.com/igorkf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-26T20:57:09Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T20:57:09Z","body":"Same issue here.   \r\nUpgrading from 1.7 to 1.9.0 solved the problem.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1292643921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"igorkf","id":47466755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDY2NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47466755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf","html_url":"https://github.com/igorkf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igorkf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
