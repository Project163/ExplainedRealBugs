E.g:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nprint(Foo().__values__)  # {'a': 1}\r\nprint(Foo().__fields_set__)  # set()\r\nprint(Foo(a=2).__values__)  # {'a': 2}\r\nprint(Foo(a=2).__fields_set__)  # {'a'}\r\nprint(Foo(b=2).__values__)  # {'a': 2}\r\nprint(Foo(b=2).__fields_set__)  # set()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the behaviour for `__fields_set__` wrong or should `.dict()` be using something else to get

aliases instead of the field names), it checks all the fields and adds the field's name if it or the alias is in `input_data`. Not sure if this is the best way to do this.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\n#517 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [ ] Tests pass on CI and coverage

Thank you for your contribution! -->\r\n<!-- See https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/#contributing-to-pydantic for help on Contributing -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry about making lots of commits on a pull request, they'll be squashed on merge anyway -->\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\nAdd support for arbitrary class instances.\r\n\r\nFrom the new docs:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass DatabaseFoo:\r\n    def __init__(self, count, size=None):\r\n        self.count = count\r\n        self.size = size\r\n\r\nclass Foo(BaseModel):\r\n    count: int = ...\r\n    size: float = None\r\n\r\ndatabase_foo = DatabaseFoo(count=2, size=4.2)\r\nm = Foo(database_foo)\r\nprint(m)\r\n# Foo count=2 size=4.2\r\nprint(m.dict())\r\n# {'count': 2, 'size': 4.2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes Pydantic compatible with virtually all ORMs and many other tools.\r\n\r\nA Pydantic model would be able to receive a SQLAlchemy model, a MongoEngine (MongoDB) model, etc.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make any assumption about the underlying data, nor any compromise with any third party library.\r\n\r\nI also tried to minimize the code change surface and the code flow alterations. So, using it as normally should be close to unaltered, but this new use case would be supported too.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis solves several things requested by FastAPI users (I think some have requested similar things here too).\r\n\r\nI planned and started the code initially in FastAPI directly but I ended up having to duplicate most of the `Field` validation functions, after trying several different things, to modify a single line in them. It would become a lot of code duplication and desynchronization with the upstream code here in Pydantic. So, I thought it could be added here.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short summary of the changes. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\nSlightly related to #491 \r\n\r\nRelated to/fixes in
