The data in db is dirty and sometimes contains `null` values in fields where it's not supposed to be. To prevent validation errors and use defaults for such values I've defined root_validator to get rid of `null`s and it've been working fine until update.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nHere is minimal example illustrated the problem. Probably it's related to changes in #2116\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Optional\r\n\r\nimport pydantic\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\n\r\nclass A(pydantic.BaseModel):\r\n    a: Optional[dict] = None\r\n    b: int = 1\r\n\r\n    class Config:\r\n        validate_assignment = True\r\n\r\n    @pydantic.root_validator(pre=True)\r\n    def omit_empty(cls, values):\r\n        \"\"\"remove None values from raw data before instance creation\"\"\"\r\n        return {k: v for k, v in values.items() if v is not None}\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_disappearing():\r\n    a = A()\r\n    assert a.a is None  # OK\r\n    a.b = 2\r\n    with pytest.raises(AttributeError) as e:\r\n        # I would never expect for attribute just disappear but it does\r\n        assert a.a is None\r\n    assert \"'A' object has no attribute 'a'\" in str(e)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
