Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace the content below with your own problem, question, or error -->\r\n\r\n* Run the test script with `python test_decimal_bug.py`\r\n* It returns a JSON with `{'id': 1.0, 'name': 'Test Obj'}`.\r\n* But I expected it to return `{'id': 1, 'name': 'Test Obj'}`.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n* OS: [e.g. Linux / Windows / macOS]: macOS & Linux\r\n* FastAPI Version [e.g. 0.3.0]: 0.62.0\r\n* Python version: 3.9.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nWhen I return the pydantic objects through an endpoint, the IDs show up correctly without the trailing invalid decimal, which further confuses me as the documentation states that this would use the very same encoder.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the tests I also tried to register a custom encoder for Ids (both the base class and alias) but this doesn't help.\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the question here.

It's great that the fix for the bug in particular got merged, but thinking further about it. \r\n\r\nIsn't it a bit strange that I still can't provide a custom encoder for the Id type? It would make sense if the encoder I provided would be used. I suspect this is because the actual type checked when encoding is that of the instance and not the type defined in the objects model class. Wouldn't it make sense to check the annotated type first for a custom encoder? \r\nAnd if not I think it would make sense to have this limitation clearly documented. \r\nOf course either way this would then be a new separate (though related) issue as we've already resolved the particular problem with decimals.
