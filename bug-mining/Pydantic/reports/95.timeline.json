Change Summary\r\nFollowing #155 and #866, here is a proposal of implementation to simplify dynamic default values\r\n\r\nRight now, to have a dynamic default value, we need to use `validators` like\r\n```python\r\nclass DynamicValueModel(BaseModel):\r\n    ts: datetime = None\r\n\r\n    @validator('ts', pre=True, always=True)\r\n        def set_ts_now(cls, v):\r\n            return v or datetime.now()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we can use `default_factory` (same name as [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.field).to be consistent)\r\n```python\r\nclass DynamicValueModel(BaseModel):\r\n    ts: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n#155 and #866\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist\r\n* [x] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at 100%\r\n* [x] Documentation reflects the changes where applicable\r\n* [x] `changes/<pull request or issue id>-<github username>.md`

\r\n```\r\nHello!\r\nI'm currently developing an API using FastAPI, and, by extension, Pydantic.\r\nThere are a few fields which require dynamic default values, e.g. `created_date`, and per https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/866 I've been using `default_factory` to do so. However, when a field has a default value defined using a factory, the dynamic value shows up in the generated JSON schema, which might not be desirable?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```py\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\r\nfrom uuid import uuid4\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\r\n\r\n\r\nclass SchemaTest(BaseModel):\r\n    uuid = Field(default_factory=uuid4)\r\n    created_date: datetime = Field(\r\n        default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc)\r\n    )\r\nprint(SchemaTest.schema_json(indent=2))\r\n```\r\nThe above outputs\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"SchemaTest\",\r\n  \"type\": \"object\",\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"created_date\": {\r\n      \"title\": \"Created Date\",\r\n      \"default\": \"2020-05-15T10:04:18.692173+00:00\",\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"uuid\": {\r\n      \"title\": \"Uuid\",\r\n      \"default\": \"79a35356-4619-49da-9bbe-4be75a696485\",\r\n      \"type\": \"string\",\r\n      \"format\": \"uuid\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThese values are of course different each time the schema is generated.\r\nI understand why it happens, but I'm not sure it's entirely correct to expose the value in the JSON schema like this. It's worth noting that this is not a problem when using the \"old\" method of setting defaults via a validator. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I'm missing something, or that this is indeed appropriate behavior. Thanks for developing such a great

Change Summary\r\n\r\nAs discussed elsewhere ([1](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1984#issuecomment-720114619), [2](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2129)), Pydantic doesn't support `typing.Annotated`/`typing_extensions.Annotated`. When using an `Annotated` field, Pydantic raises:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Fields of type \"<class 'typing.Annotated'>\" are not supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `Annotated` by simply unwrapping the root type in `ModelField`. The full `Annotated` information is still visible with `get_type_hints(x, include_extras=True)` on the `BaseModel` subclasses.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this needs doc updates, perhaps just a small note saying \"Annotated type hints are supported\"?\r\n\r\nSeparately, I'm working on a prototype for https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2129 in https://github.com/JacobHayes/pydantic-annotated which expands on this functionality. I have a small check (based on the presence of `pydantic.typing.Annotated`) in there to do the unwrapping until this or similar is merged.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\n-

First Check\n\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I used the GitHub search to find a similar issue and didn't find it.\n- [X] I searched the FastAPI documentation, with the integrated search.\n- [X] I already searched in Google \"How to X in FastAPI\" and didn't find any information.\n- [X] I already read and followed all the tutorial in the docs and didn't find an answer.\n- [X] I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to [Pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic).\n- [X] I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui).\n- [X] I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc).\n\n### Commit to Help\n\n- [X] I commit to help with one of those options 👆\n\n### Example Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional\r\n\r\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Body, Query\r\n\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI()\r\n\r\n\r\ndef body_default():\r\n    return -1\r\n\r\n\r\ndef query_default():\r\n    return -2\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.post(\"/\")\r\nasync def root(\r\n    my_query: Optional[int] = Query(default_factory=query_default),\r\n    my_body: Optional[int] = Body(embed=True, default_factory=body_default),\r\n):\r\n    return {\"body\": my_body, \"query\": my_query}\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.post(\"/error\")\r\nasync def error(\r\n    my_body: Optional[int] = Body(embed=True, default=0, default_factory=body_default),\r\n):\r\n    return {}\n```\n\n\n### Description\n\ni want to use default_factory on Body and Query\r\n\r\nmake a post request with no body and no query parameter.\r\n~~~curl\r\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:8000/ -X POST\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n1- i expect to get the default values that default_factory created \r\nbut it returns a field required error.\r\n2- after fixing the above issue and marking the field as nonrequired i expect to get the value of default_factory() but i get None.\r\n\r\n3- with the second example function (/error) i think the expected behaviour of a pydantic FieldInfo is to validate the arguments and if the field has a default and also a  default_factory it should raise a runtime error.\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Operating System Details\n\n_No response_\n\n### FastAPI Version\n\n0.85.0\n\n### Python Version\n\n3.10.5\n\n### Additional Context\n\nfor the \"field required\" error i think the problem is with [this line of dependencies/utils.py](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/c6aa28bea2f751a91078bd8d845133ff83f352bf/fastapi/dependencies/utils.py#L383)  it should also check if a default_factory is provided and mark the field as nonrequired.\r\n\r\nby fixing the first issue you can proceed to call the api and get the default value. but the default value is None.\r\ni managed to fix this by using pydantic ModelField's get_default method instead of using \"default\" property in [request_params_to_args](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/c6aa28bea2f751a91078bd8d845133ff83f352bf/fastapi/dependencies/utils.py#L610) and [request_body_to_args](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/c6aa28bea2f751a91078bd8d845133ff83f352bf/fastapi/dependencies/utils.py#L669) functions. \r\n\r\nthis changes produce a problem in schema
