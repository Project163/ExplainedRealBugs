'email-validator', 'devtools']\r\n```\r\n\r\npydantic offers a feature called \"Custom Root Type\": https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#custom-root-types\r\n\r\nFor now it looks like there is general poor support for such objects across available BaseModel methods.\r\n\r\n### `validate()` function used by `fastapi` does not consider this setting at all:\r\n```\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\nfrom typing import List\r\n\r\nclass SubModel(BaseModel):\r\n    name: str\r\n\r\nclass ListModel(BaseModel):\r\n    __root__: List[SubModel]\r\n\r\ndef test_validate():\r\n    list_model = ListModel.validate([{\"name\": \"foo\"}])\r\n    assert isinstance(list_model, ListModel)\r\n```\r\nThis should pass, however `pydantic.errors.DictError: value is not a valid dict` is raised instead.\r\n`validate()` function also isn't documented at all.\r\nWhile such thing is implemented by `parse_obj()` it does not implement other features that `validate()` has, for example `cls.__config__.orm_mode`.\r\nAlso these two functions looks pretty the same, what are the differences between them?\r\n\r\n### `dict()` method used by `fastapi` returns value other than expected\r\nWhile this is documented, and probably `dict()` should not return anything other than `dict` at the moment there is no function opposite to `parse_obj()`, eg. returning what `dict()` returns for normal models, and direct `__root__` value for custom root type objects. Maybe `serialize_obj()` should be added?\r\n\r\n### Custom Root Type could probably use single `__init__` parameter.\r\nThis would allow to completly hide __root__ argument\r\n\r\n### Custom Root Type models should be a separate classes?\r\nAs handling them is a separate thing, and putting `if __custom_root_type__` everywhere does not seem to be reasonable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1193/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3488997112,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ4ODk5NzExMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/3488997112","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5a2d78765a8b2cb5e0526efb50fd548d0d3bf98b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/commits/5a2d78765a8b2cb5e0526efb50fd548d0d3bf98b","created_at":"2020-06-27T13:55:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
