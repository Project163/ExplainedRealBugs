Here's a currently failing test case that illustrates the issue:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n@skip_36\r\ndef test_generic_subclass_of_concrete_generic():\r\n    T = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\n    U = TypeVar(\"U\")\r\n\r\n    class GenericBaseModel(GenericModel, Generic[T]):\r\n        data: T\r\n\r\n    class GenericSub(GenericBaseModel[int], Generic[U]):\r\n        extra: U\r\n\r\n    GenericSub[str]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently that test case fails with `TypeError: Cannot parameterize a concrete instantiation of a generic model`\r\n\r\nThis happens because `GenericBaseModel[int].__concrete__` gets set to `True`, and `GenericSub` inherits it.\r\n\r\nThis can easily be fixed with the following change to `generics.py`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n        if cls.__concrete__:\r\n            raise TypeError('Cannot parameterize a concrete instantiation of a generic model')\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould become\r\n\r\n```py\r\n        if cls.__concrete__ and typing.Generic not in cls.__bases__:\r\n            raise TypeError('Cannot parameterize a concrete instantiation of a generic model')\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
