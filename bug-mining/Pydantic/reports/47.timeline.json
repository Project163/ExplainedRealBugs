added the type hint, but for some reason it doesn't seem to be working for me. \r\n\r\n\r\nI then use those as models with Fast API, and again the dynamic class fails type checks.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, create_model, ValidationError\r\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Body\r\n\r\n# Base Model\r\nclass Test(BaseModel):\r\n    x: int\r\n\r\n\r\n# Dynamic Model\r\nTestDynamic = create_model('TestDynamic', x=0)\r\n\r\nt1 = Test(x=1) # hover shows `t1: Test`\r\nt2 = TestDynamic(x=1) # hover  shows no type\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI()\r\n\r\n# Passes\r\n@app.post(\"/points/\", response_model=Test)\r\ndef create_test_1(test_obj: Test):\r\n    return test_obj\r\n\r\n# Fails: mypy: invalid type TestDynamic\r\n@app.post(\"/points/\", response_model=TestDynamic)\r\ndef create_test_2(test_obj: TestDynamic):\r\n    return test_obj\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, and I am sorry if I missing something basic. \r\nI am just starting to learn python typing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-21 at 2 07 14
