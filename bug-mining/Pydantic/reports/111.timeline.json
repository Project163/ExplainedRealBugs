Bug\r\n\r\nA side-effect of #1432 is that `__modify_schema__` on enum subclasses is still affecting the field schema, rather than the enumeration schema.\r\n\r\nI'd like it if `__modify_schema__` applied to the resulting enum model.  Does that seem reasonable?\r\n\r\nIn my use case I'm subclassing enum to add a `tsEnumNames` property, so that I could generate proper typescript enums from the resulting Json schema (using json-schema-to-typescript -
