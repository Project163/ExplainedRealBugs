Think about building an ORM.  Imagine all of your pydantic models (like Users in the example below) extend your own base `Model` class which had classmethods of `find()`, `where()`, and `get()`.  This allows you to use your model in an ORM fasion like so.\r\n\r\n* Users.find(1)\r\n* Users.where('field', 'value').get()\r\n* And many others (orderBy, limit etc...)\r\n\r\nAll fine, until the user wants a field called `find`, or `where`, or `get` etc...  I understand they can set the field to `get_` and use a alias for the actual db column named `get` but this seems an ugly hack when you could have just allowed shadowing.\r\n\r\nWith the above PR `utils.validate_field_name` will throw a shadow error if the user wants fields called `find` or `where` or `get` etc...  Your main argument is that it's \"confusing\" the difference between `Users.find` and `user.find`.  Well, they are two completely different things, and should be allowed.  Shadowing is an important part of any language and is a powerful tool when dealing with class variables vs instance variables.   My only option at this point is to maintain a fork or pydantic which removes this `validate_field_name` method completely so I can build a nice ORM without working about stomping all over the users \"field\" namespace.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/689721196/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mreschke","id":4038770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzg3NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4038770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke","html_url":"https://github.com/mreschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/689722095","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/242#issuecomment-689722095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/242","id":689722095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTcyMjA5NQ==","user":{"login":"mreschke","id":4038770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzg3NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4038770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke","html_url":"https://github.com/mreschke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mreschke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-09T17:54:55Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T17:54:55Z","body":"Perhaps allow shadowing could be a config variable?

currently a tension in pydantic: understandably there's a desire to add more public methods to models, for example `iter` in #997. But there's also a concern with adding more public methods since they might conflict with fields people want to add, e.g. in the above example it would cause annoyance if someone wanted an `iter` field (there's an issue about this somewhere, but I can't find it right now, pointer welcome).\r\n\r\nOf course this can be partially solve with aliases, but it's still frustrating and confusing.\r\n\r\nPotential solutions:\r\n* make all the methods on models \"private\" (this is what's done I think on named tuples) so `my_model.dict()` would become `my_model._dict()`. This would upset pycharm and perhaps linting tools a lot and would look ugly.\r\n* move all public methods into a single namespace, e.g. `my_model.dict()` would become `my_model.<whatever>.dict()`. Slightly more typing but I think clearest.\r\n\r\n**Obviously if we do this is would need to be in version 2.**\r\n\r\nI think the second solution would be the best approach. Questions:\r\n* do you agree?\r\n* would it have a performance impact, I guess; yes but small?\r\n* **most importantly:** if this is agreed with, what name should we use?\r\n\r\nI think something short, preferably one character.\r\n\r\nHow about `m`, standing for either \"methods\" or \"model\"?\r\n\r\nExample of this usage:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom typing import List\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass User(BaseModel):\r\n    id: int\r\n    name = 'John Doe'\r\n    signup_ts: datetime = None\r\n    friends: List[int] = []\r\n\r\nuser = User(id=123)\r\nprint(user.m.dict())\r\nprint(user.m.schema())\r\n```\r\n\r\n@dmontagu, @MrMrRobat, anyone else; thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1001/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1001/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/689764638","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/242#issuecomment-689764638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/242","id":689764638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTc2NDYzOA==","user":{"login":"layday","id":31134424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTM0NDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31134424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday","html_url":"https://github.com/layday","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/layday/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-09T19:19:21Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T19:19:55Z","body":"Well, that kind of shadowing isn't compatible with type checking in Python; you cannot have a field with a disparate type on a sub-model.  You _can_ define your class methods on the metaclass so that they are not present on instances of `Users` but your type checker (assuming you use one) won't know what to do with them either:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pydantic.main import ModelMetaclass, BaseModel\r\n\r\n\r\nclass UsersMeta(ModelMetaclass):\r\n    def find(cls, pk: int) -> 'Users': ...\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Users(BaseModel,
