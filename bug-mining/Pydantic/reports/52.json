What I mean by \"composition\", is being able to define a partial, parameterized model, which can yield new, complete models/validators by combining with other models/validators. This could be done by exploiting something like `typing.Generic`, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nimport typing\r\nimport pydantic\r\n\r\nT = typing.TypeVar(\"T\")\r\n\r\nclass Response(pydantic.GenericModel[T]):\r\n    data: T = ...\r\n    total_count: int = None\r\n```\r\nand then, one could use `Response[MyModel]` or `Response[List[MyModel]]` as validators. \r\n\r\nI think support for generic is mentioned in https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/380.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
