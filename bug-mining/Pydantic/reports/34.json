Many of them said that an almost blank ``README.rst`` make them think the package is not really alive. I think it's a good point. As many developers use GitHub as a kind of social network, checking for projects people they follow like or star, we need a quick introduction to what *pydantic* is. I know it's already in the documentation. But saving people a few mouse clicks may make a difference.\r\n\r\n`README.rst` should not copy or extend a great documentation we already have. Instead it should tell GitHub users (i.e. developers) the most essential things about *pydantic* in a concise manner. \r\nI'd suggest the following structure:\r\n\r\n* Intro (what's pydantic)\r\n* Installation (pip)\r\n* A Simple Example (a first example from the docs)\r\n* Contributing (link to contributing section in the docs)\r\n* Links\r\n  * Documentation\r\n  * License\r\n  * Releases in the CheeseShop\r\n  * Source code (GitHub link)\r\n  * Issue tracker (GitHub Issues)\r\n  * Test status\r\n  * Test coverage\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
