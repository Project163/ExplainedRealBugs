thanks for the quick fix! \r\n\r\nCurrently there are relatively few pydantic + pyright users who are on Python 3.11, but that number will increase as 3.11 approaches release. I could put some temporary special-case hackery in place within pyright to work around this issue, but I'd prefer not to do this if it can be helped. It looks like you release new versions of pydantic pretty frequently (ever week or so). I think it's therefore safe to just wait for your next release and tell developers to upgrade to it.
