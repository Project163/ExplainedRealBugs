Thank you for your contribution! -->\r\n<!-- Unless your change is trivial, please create an issue to discuss the change before creating a PR -->\r\n<!-- See https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/contributing/ for help on Contributing -->\r\n\r\n## Change Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a `ClassVar` is defined on a model and re-defined\r\non a sub-model omitting the `ClassVar` annotation, Pydantic produces an\r\nunrelated error:\r\n\r\n    NameError: Field name \"...\" shadows a BaseModel attribute ...\r\n\r\nThis check was introduced to prevent shadowing Pydantic's own methods\r\nand attributes defined on the `BaseModel` class.  Following this change,\r\nclass variables (that is, variables annotated with `ClassVar`)\r\ndefined on parent models will be inherited by sub-models and\r\nwill be overwritable without having to reapply the annotation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short summary of the changes. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\n\r\nfix #2061\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes
