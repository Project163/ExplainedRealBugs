`schema` returns multiple `allOf`s inside `anyOf` when `Union` is used in combination with `Field`. It will work fine with no `Union` which is what is currently included in all the tests.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue I only collect the referenced object when the schema is generated for a case with multiple sub-fileds and overwrite is True.\r\n\r\nSee #1209 for a more detailed explanation of the problem.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\nresolves #1209\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests

for `optional_color_3`.
