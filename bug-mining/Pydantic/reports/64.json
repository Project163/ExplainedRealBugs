I also believe the cause is different.\r\n\r\nMy MWE:\r\n```py\r\nfrom pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass\r\n\r\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\r\nclass Person:\r\n    name: str\r\n\r\nPerson(name=\"Bob\")\r\n```\r\nWhen I type-check it with `mypy main.py`, it runs without errors, as expected. However, when I run it with `mypy --strict main.py` (or, more specifically, `mypy --no-implicit-reexport main.py`), I get \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: Module 'pydantic.dataclasses' has no attribute 'dataclass'; maybe \"dataclasses\"?\r\nerror: Unexpected keyword argument \"name\" for \"Person\"\r\n```\r\n(or, similarly, for `Person(\"Bob\")`, I get `error: Too many arguments for \"Person\"`)\r\n\r\n> `--no-implicit-reexport` By default, imported values to a module are treated as exported and mypy allows other modules to import them. This flag changes the behavior to not re-export unless the item is imported using from-as or is included in `__all__`. Note this is always treated as enabled for stub files.\r\n(https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/mypy/latest/mypy.pdf, p.122)\r\n\r\nThis would lead me to believe that there's an issue with my or pydantic's imports, but it is just a theory.\r\n\r\nFor now, I hope to work around this by calling mypy without `--no-implicit-reexport`, but I suspect other people will get there when using `mypy --strict`. In general, I'd be happy to know if there's a solution to this.
