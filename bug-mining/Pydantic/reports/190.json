just like ``field_validator('*')`` is a thing? defining a field serializer for all fields in the model is definitely useful, or am i missing something? one could think that it'd be equivalent to defining a ``model_serializer``, but that's not quite the case, because in a ``model_serializer`` the user would have to recreate the serialization logic for the dictionary keys, while in a ``field_serializer`` we're able to specifically target the serialization of the field value.\r\n\r\nthis is a 2-lines change, i can submit a PR right away if this is indeed a missing feature.\n\n### Example Code\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python, Pydantic & OS Version\n\n```Text\npydantic version: 2.7.0a1                                                                                          pydantic-core version: 2.16.2                                                                                             pydantic-core build: profile=release pgo=false                                                                                 install path: C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\Lib\\site-packages\\pydantic                          python version: 3.11.2 (tags/v3.11.2:878ead1, Feb  7 2023, 16:38:35) [MSC v.1934 64 bit (AMD64)]                              platform: Windows-10-10.0.19045-SP0                                                                             related packages: email-validator-2.0.0.post2 mypy-1.8.0 pyright-1.1.352 typing_extensions-4.10.0                                 commit: unknown\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"sydney-runkle","id":54324534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzI0NTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54324534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle","html_url":"https://github.com/sydney-runkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sydney-runkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8990/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
