Checks\r\n\r\n* [x] I added a descriptive title to this issue\r\n* [x] I have searched (google, github) for similar issues and couldn't find anything\r\n* [x] I have read and followed [the docs](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and still think this is a bug\r\n\r\n<!-- Sorry to sound so draconian, but every second saved replying to issues is time spend improving pydantic :-) -->\r\n\r\n# Bug\r\n\r\nI'm expecting to be able to use a database connection url such as `postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost:5432/app` (a format [SQLAlchemy is supporting](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/dialects/postgresql.html#dialect-postgresql-psycopg2-connect)). \r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't seem to accept the `+psycopg2` part. \r\n\r\nOutput of `python -c \"import pydantic.utils; print(pydantic.utils.version_info())\"`:\r\n```\r\n             pydantic version: 1.8.1\r\n            pydantic compiled: False\r\n                 install path: /Users/krisb/Code/fork/pydantic/pydantic\r\n               python version: 3.7.10 (default, Apr 12 2021, 03:46:49)  [Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.29)]\r\n                     platform: Darwin-20.3.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n     optional deps. installed: ['devtools', 'dotenv', 'email-validator', 'typing-extensions']\r\n```\r\n<!-- or if you're using pydantic prior to v1.3, manually include: OS, python version and pydantic version -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [docs](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and search through issues to\r\nconfirm your bug hasn't already been reported. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Where possible please include a self-contained code snippet describing your bug: -->\r\n\r\nChanged test https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/7af90a8d6c1c406799ad95b81e353b386cde5745/tests/test_networks.py#L318-L318 to include \r\n```py\r\nassert Model(a='postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost:5432/app').a == 'postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost:5432/app'\r\n```\r\npytest error output:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n>           raise

allowed_schemes={'postgres', 'postgresql'})\r\n\r\npydantic/main.py:400: ValidationError\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1142, and a workaround for now is to use `AnyUrl` where this type of URL is supported.
