Change Summary\r\n\r\nIndeed, the bug is originated from the change main.py:169. The fields of C is a deepcopy of it's parent class, so C.value_b.validate_always = B.value_b.validate_always = False\r\nhttps://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/1eeb225c67f1131f948c5f129f5c2e56a4c2c6b7/pydantic/main.py#L881-L883\r\nSo value_b is not validated. Just move the assignment of validate_always from self.prepare() to self.populate_validators(), then the bug is solved. \r\n\r\n## Related issue
