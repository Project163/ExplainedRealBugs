got extremely frustrated with aliases in `BaseSettings` a number of times:\r\n* they don't work well with inheritance\r\n* you very often want to look for more than one alias, eg. [here](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/aiohttp-toolbox/blob/4846214cd9523cc50683ec6b08350412ec13d81b/atoolbox/settings.py#L107) I have redis `'redis_settings': 'REDISCLOUD_URL'` so aiohttp-toolbox works \"out of the box\" (no pun intended) on heroku with the redis cloud plugin I regularly use, but it's a slightly mad default. It would be much better if I could set multiple env varibles to inspect `{'REDISCLOUD_URL', 'REDIS_URL'}` or whatever.\r\n* aliases are weird when initialising normally using arguments (eg. for testing) when you don't want to look for env variables, eg. I'd expect to do `Settings(pg_dsn='postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/test_db')` not have to respect the env var name and do `Settings(DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/test_db')`\r\n\r\nHow do we work around this?\r\n\r\nI'd therefore like to completely change how environment variables are interpreted in `BaseSettings`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseSettings\r\n\r\nclass Settings(BaseSettings):\r\n    pg_dsn: str = 'postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/app'\r\n\r\n    class Config:\r\n        fields = {'pg_dsn': {'env': {'DATABASE_URL', 'PG_DSN'}}}\r\n\r\n# or using Field (#577):\r\nclass Settings(BaseSettings):\r\n    pg_dsn: str = Field('postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/app', env={'DATABASE_URL', 'PG_DSN'})\r\n\r\n# creating manually for testing (here i can use the raw field name since alias hasn't changed):\r\nsettings = Settings(pg_dsn='postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/testing')\r\n```\r\nas discussed on #747 `env` would be completely case insensitive.\r\n\r\nthoughts?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/521191005/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/521193938","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/721#issuecomment-521193938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/721","id":521193938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTE5MzkzOA==","user":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T10:36:52Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T10:37:00Z","body":"> It would be much better if I could set multiple env varibles to inspect {'REDISCLOUD_URL', 'REDIS_URL'} or whatever.\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\nIn general aliases seem to make more sense to me in the context of `BaseModel` than `BaseSettings`.

Feature Request\r\n\r\nI would really like a lightweight CLI-argument parsing class, similar to `BaseSettings`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese days I always find myself using `BaseSettings` whenever I need to read something from the environment. Using this class is so convenient that I have started to eschew the use of arguments for lightweight scripts and instead just reading values from the environment (and using pydantic to parse them).\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, though, it seems like it might be nice to just have a built-in class like `BaseSettings` for parsing command line arguments, maybe `BaseCLIArguments`? I always find myself struggling to remember the syntax for argparse; I personally think this is a great use case for pydantic.\r\n\r\nI know there are lots of other libraries that handle command line argument parsing, but given how little effort I think it would take to integrate this with pydantic, I would *much* prefer to not need to learn (and remember) yet another tool.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't mind if it were highly opinionated in the interest of simplicity; I just want an easy way to get parsed command line arguments using patterns I already use daily (namely, `BaseModel`).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(Either way I'll probably implement this for myself, but I will put more care into it if there is any interest in upstreaming it.

The nested `Config` from my experience with my team here is less common and comes as a surprise :tada:.\r\n\r\nWhile the usage of `set` for `env` is correct in your example, I also think using a `list` there would be more typical and reduce confusion of it being a `dict`.  Are the additional features of `set` being used?  Was it chosen simply because items should be unique and because order is not important?   Perhaps the ordering offered by a `list` is an important **feature** to some.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/531900135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"skewty","id":9087223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODcyMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9087223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty","html_url":"https://github.com/skewty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skewty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/533527872","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/721#issuecomment-533527872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/721","id":533527872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzUyNzg3Mg==","user":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T12:12:53Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T12:12:53Z","body":"Yes order of `env` may well be important.
