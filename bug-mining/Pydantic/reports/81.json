I had originally opened a bug report there (https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/776), but with @dmontagu's assistance was able to come up with a repro for just pydantic.\r\n\r\n# Bug\r\nIf appears that when nesting None in default values of attributes, that pydantic cannot handle that case.\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.3\r\n* Python version `import sys; print(sys.version)`: 3.7.4\r\n* Pydantic version `import pydantic; print(pydantic.VERSION)`: 1.2\r\n\r\n## Reproduce\r\n```py\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass Model(BaseModel):\r\n    state = [None]\r\n\r\nModel.schema()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Traceback\r\n```log\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"pydantic/json.py\", line 57, in pydantic.json.pydantic_encoder\r\nKeyError: <class 'NoneType'>\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"repro.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    Model.schema()\r\n  File \"pydantic/main.py\", line 511, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.schema\r\n  File \"pydantic/schema.py\", line 146, in pydantic.schema.model_schema\r\n  File \"pydantic/schema.py\", line 465, in pydantic.schema.model_process_schema\r\n  File \"pydantic/schema.py\", line 494, in pydantic.schema.model_type_schema\r\n  File \"pydantic/schema.py\", line 191, in pydantic.schema.field_schema\r\n  File \"pydantic/schema.py\", line 745, in genexpr\r\n  File \"pydantic/schema.py\", line 745, in genexpr\r\n  File \"pydantic/schema.py\", line 749, in pydantic.schema.encode_default\r\n  File \"pydantic/json.py\", line 59, in pydantic.json.pydantic_encoder\r\nTypeError: Object of type 'NoneType' is not JSON serializable\r\n```\r\nI am taking a look at getting a PR working to fix it in `pydantic.schema.encode_default`. Any feedback or thoughts on that approach?\r\n\r\nAnd thanks again for a great project!","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
