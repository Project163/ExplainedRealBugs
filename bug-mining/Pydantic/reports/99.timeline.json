docs](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and still think this is a bug\r\n\r\n# Version\r\npydantic version: 1.9.1\r\npydantic compiled: True\r\n python version: 3.10.4 (main, Mar 31 2022,

this:\r\nShallow copied lists are the same reference, but setting a new reference on the copy does not modify the original.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nimport copy \r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass X:\r\n    val : List[int]\r\n\r\nx = X(val=[1])\r\ny = copy.copy(x)\r\n\r\nassert x.val == y.val\r\n\r\ny.val = []\r\n\r\nassert y.val != x.val\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not true for pydantic\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass X(BaseModel):\r\n     val: List[int]\r\n\r\nx = X(val=[1])\r\ny = copy.copy(x)\r\n\r\nassert x.val == y.val # holds\r\n\r\ny.val = []\r\n\r\nassert y.val != x.val #error\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected and forces otherwise agnostic code to check if a passed object is a pydantic object. \r\n\r\nAlso based on #1383 is would assume this is not desired.
