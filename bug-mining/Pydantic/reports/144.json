But in our project this broke pickle\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport pickle\r\nimport dataclasses\r\n\r\nimport pydantic\r\n\r\n\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass BuiltInDataclass:\r\n    value: int\r\n\r\n\r\nclass PydanticModel(pydantic.BaseModel):\r\n    built_in_dataclass: BuiltInDataclass\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(pickle.dumps(\r\n    PydanticModel(built_in_dataclass=BuiltInDataclass(value=0))\r\n))\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput:\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-14-7d67a44cf353> in <module>\r\n     15\r\n     16 print(pickle.dumps(\r\n---> 17     PydanticModel(built_in_dataclass=BuiltInDataclass(value=0))\r\n     18 ))\r\n\r\nPicklingError: Can't pickle <class '__main__.BuiltInDataclass'>: it's not the same object as __main__.BuiltInDataclass\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor better understanding here's an issue of pickle outside of pydantic context. This is an old pickle problem, when different classes have the same name, simple way to reproduce:\r\n```\r\nimport pickle\r\n\r\n\r\nclass A: pass\r\n\r\n\r\n# this is an analogy of how pydantic convert built-in dataclass\r\nB = type(A.__name__, (A,), {})\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(A)\r\n# <class '__main__.A'>\r\n\r\nprint(B)\r\n# <class '__main__.A'>\r\n\r\npickle.dumps(A)\r\n# b'\\x80\\x03c__main__\\nA\\nq\\x00.'\r\n\r\npickle.dumps(B)\r\n# error\r\n```\r\noutput\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-2-b97d2c67736c> in <module>\r\n     10\r\n     11 print(pickle.dumps(A))\r\n---> 12 print(pickle.dumps(B))\r\n\r\nPicklingError: Can't pickle <class '__main__.A'>: it's not the same object as __main__.A\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a result we can't use this feature, we're stick to intermediate classes that converts buit-in dataclasses to pydantic:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SerializedDataclass(pydantic.BaseModel):\r\n\t# copy/paste of all fields from built-in dataclass\r\n    value: float\r\n\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2111/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
