Question\r\n\r\nHi! I want to validate a model whose definition I don't control from a package we depend on. That model consists of nested dataclasses. I thought I'd be able to subclass that model with pydantic's `dataclass` decorator and it would work just fine, and it does, but only if the model I am subclassing doesn't have any nested dataclasses. Here's what I mean:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass as pydataclass\r\n\r\n# FROM AN EXTERNAL PACKAGE\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass NavbarButton:\r\n    href: str\r\n\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Navbar:\r\n    button: NavbarButton\r\n# END EXTERNAL PACKAGE\r\n\r\n@pydataclass\r\nclass CustomNavbar(Navbar):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nnavbar = CustomNavbar(\"https://example.com\",)\r\nprint(navbar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis throws:\r\n\r\n`RuntimeError: no validator found for <class '__main__.NavbarButton'>, see arbitrary_types_allowed in Config`\r\n\r\nIs there any way to get Pydantic to play nice with these classes except by essentially copying code?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3642532092,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM2NDI1MzIwOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/3642532092","actor":{"login":"PrettyWood","id":18406791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18406791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood","html_url":"https://github.com/PrettyWood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f014dd21a741155aad136fecdf33f788d9501a5b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PrettyWood/pydantic/commits/f014dd21a741155aad136fecdf33f788d9501a5b","created_at":"2020-08-11T10:37:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"PrettyWood","id":18406791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Nzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18406791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood","html_url":"https://github.com/PrettyWood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrettyWood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-11T10:39:18Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T10:39:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1817","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1817/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1817/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1817/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/1817","id":676770299,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDY2MDIxNjE5","number":1817,"title":"feat:
