this is my second weird bug report in two days, let me first say that Pydantic has enabled me to prototype big chunks of a somewhat complex protocol very quickly, and I really appreciate what you've built. I feel I'm just stumbling around into odd corners as I learn to use this tool.\r\n\r\n### Checks\r\n\r\n* [x] I added a descriptive title to this issue\r\n* [x] I have searched (google, github) for similar issues and couldn't find anything\r\n* [x] I have read and followed [the docs](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and still think this is a bug\r\n\r\n# Bug\r\n\r\nOutput of `python -c \"import pydantic.utils; print(pydantic.utils.version_info())\"`:\r\n```\r\n             pydantic version: 1.8.1\r\n            pydantic compiled: False\r\n                 install path: /nix/store/1f6nk37c7df54cm8b3rlnn6pidaa3mrp-python3.8-pydantic-1.8.1/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pydantic\r\n               python version: 3.8.8 (default, Feb 19 2021, 11:04:50)  [GCC 9.3.0]\r\n                     platform: Linux-5.4.114-x86_64-with\r\n     optional deps. installed: ['typing-extensions']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following call raises `TypeError` when I expected it to raise `ValidationError`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport pydantic\r\n\r\npydantic.BaseModel.parse_obj([[None, None]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis came up when throwing random JSON at my API using Hypothesis.\r\n\r\n`parse_obj` looks like this in the Pydantic version I'm using:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def parse_obj(cls: Type['Model'], obj: Any) -> 'Model':\r\n        obj = cls._enforce_dict_if_root(obj)\r\n        if not isinstance(obj, dict):\r\n            try:\r\n                obj = dict(obj)\r\n            except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\r\n                exc = TypeError(f'{cls.__name__} expected dict not {obj.__class__.__name__}')\r\n                raise ValidationError([ErrorWrapper(exc, loc=ROOT_KEY)], cls) from e\r\n        return cls(**obj)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess what's happening is: `obj` is not a `dict`, but it _is_ an iterable of pairs, so it converts to a `dict` without trouble; however, the `cls(**obj)` call requires that the dictionary's keys are all strings, which is not checked.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem like a security bug to me since Pydantic doesn't allow the invalid data through either way, but I do feel like it's a bug that under some circumstances the exception that's thrown is `TypeError` instead of `ValidationError`.\r\n\r\nI'm also surprised to learn that at the root of an object, Pydantic treats iterables of pairs the same as it treats dictionaries. I understand the [Data Conversion](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#data-conversion) warning in the documentation, I think, but I didn't know that extended beyond fields. In fact the documentation for `parse_obj` says it shouldn't:\r\n\r\n> parse_obj: this is very similar to the `__init__` method of the model, except it takes a dict rather than keyword arguments. If the object passed is not a dict a `ValidationError` will be raised.\r\n\r\nI'm now working around it by explicitly checking that I got a `dict` from JSON decoding before passing it to Pydantic, which I guess is fine; I just feel like this needs stronger warnings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2762/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2762/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
