https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/contributing/ for help on Contributing -->\r\n<!-- PLEASE DO **NOT** put issue ids in the PR title! Instead, add a descriptive title and put ids in the body -->\r\nI was confused about when exactly `allow_reuse=True` was required, so I looked into the implementation. As far as I can tell, the motivation behind the feature is outlined in https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/312#issuecomment-449875744. \r\n\r\nI think the same goal can be accomplished more cleanly with the metaclass's [`__prepare__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#preparing-the-class-namespace) method, without requiring the library user to set `allow_reuse=True`.\r\n## Change Summary\r\nThis PR replaces the \"duplicate validator\" detection mechanism. \r\nBefore, there was a `set` of qualified validator names, and if a validator was added with a qualified name that already existed in the set, this was detected as a duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe new mechanism is to directly detect when a validator is re-assigned within the class body, by using a custom `dict` subclass as the class namespace. This is more convenient because it works without the user needing to specify `allow_reuse=True`, while still detecting validators with duplicate names.\r\n\r\nI think it would be best to merge/implement this for pydantic V2, and retire the `allow_reuse` parameter for V2. However, if you want this for V1, this PR essentially deprecates the `allow_reuse` parameter, which no longer has any effect. It can be merged into V1 with the appropriate documentation changes.\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\nNone\r\n<!-- Are there any issues opened that will be resolved by merging this change? -->\r\n<!-- WARNING: please use \"fix #123\" style references so the issue is closed when this PR is merged. -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Unit tests for the changes exist - covered by the existing `test_duplicates`.\r\n* [x] Tests pass on CI and coverage remains at 100%\r\n* [x] Documentation reflects the changes where applicable - not relevant unless you plan to merge this to V1. For V2 this would just be removing the documentation for `allow_reuse`.\r\n* [ ] `changes/<pull request or issue id>-<github username>.md` file added describing change\r\n  If we're not merging to V1 then we can skip change file check.\r\n* [x] My PR is ready to review, **please add a comment including the phrase \"please review\" to assign

3218, patch pydantic `in_ipython` function to remove `duplicate validator error` error during streamlit script rerun. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore contributing (PLEASE READ!)\r\n\r\n⚠️ If your contribution is more than a few lines of code, then prior to starting to code on it please post in the issue saying you want to volunteer, then wait for a positive response. And if there is no issue for it yet, create it first.\r\n\r\nThis helps make sure:\r\n\r\n  1. Two people aren't working on the same thing\r\n  2. This is something Streamlit's maintainers believe should be implemented/fixed\r\n  3. Any API, UI, or deeper architectural changes that need to be implemented have been fully thought through by Streamlit's maintainers\r\n  4. Your time is well spent!\r\n\r\nMore information in our wiki: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Contributing\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 📚 Context\r\n\r\nPydantic by default disallows to reuse of validators with the same name, this combined with the Streamlit execution model leads to an error on the second streamlit script rerun if the Pydantic validator is registered in the streamlit script. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the same issue exists for Pydantic validators inside Jupyter notebooks, https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/312 , please see [this comment](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/312#issuecomment-449875744) and to fix that in Pydantic they use the `in_ipython` function that checks that pydantic runs not in `ipython` environment (they try to `eval('__IPYTHON__')` in that function)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/blob/d61792cc42c80b13b23e3ffa74bc37ec7c77f7d1/pydantic/class_validators.py#L149 \r\n\r\nSo to fix this error we have several options:\r\n1. open PR to pydantic v1 repo with the suggestion to add the `in_streamlit` function\r\n    This could be inefficient because active development in v1 branch is finished, and they concentrated to v2 development\r\n2. Set `__IPYTHON__` flag in Streamlit \r\n    This could lead to unexpected consequences, if other 3rd party libraries also refer to that flag. \r\n3. Redefine `in_ipython` function  inside `bootstrap.py` to return always `True`\r\n     Changes in this PR\r\n\r\nAnother relevant note is that the mechanism of duplicate detection completely rewritten for Pydantic v2 (which has not yet been released), and this should not be an issue for Pydantic 2. \r\nhttps://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/5398 , and this should not be an issue for pydantic v2. \r\n \r\n Resuming all the above, this change will relax rules for writing pydantic validators inside Streamlit script a little bit, similar to how it works in jupyter, which should not be critical. \r\n \r\n This also should work correctly even if Pydantic v2 is installed, since `class_validators` has been kept in V2 too. \r\n\r\n- What kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n  - [X]
