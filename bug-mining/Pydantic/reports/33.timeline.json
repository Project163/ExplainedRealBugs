Feature Request\r\n\r\nWe want to define our own generic container-types (similar to `List[T]`), but we want to do the type-checking on our own:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Array(numpy.ndarray, Collection[T]):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def get_validators(cls):\r\n        yield cls.validate_type\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def validate_type(cls, val):\r\n        return np.array(val, dtype=cls.__args__[0])\r\n\r\n(We read in very large lists from a json-file, and pydantic's validation logic is a real bottleneck).\r\n\r\nclass MyModel:\r\n    values: Array[float]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nFor now, pydantic assumes that generic types are from a selected set (Tuple, List, Mapping, plus a few others) and therefore this assertion error is thrown [here](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/725e86a8f0ebdfb509e8a70384b5d45e0788ae46/pydantic/fields.py#L173):\r\n\r\n\r\n```py\r\nassert issubclass(origin, Mapping)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\nAllowing this, could generally be done in two ways:\r\n\r\n* Treat custom generic types not differently than other types. The type-parameter is just ignored by pydantic.\r\n* Have a notion of general generic types in pydantic, and provide a validation-interface which allows users to interact with the type-parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/380/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/474965514","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/304#issuecomment-474965514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/304","id":474965514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDk2NTUxNA==","user":{"login":"pilosus","id":6400248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDAyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6400248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus","html_url":"https://github.com/pilosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pilosus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-20T18:11:38Z","updated_at":"2019-03-20T18:11:52Z","body":">
