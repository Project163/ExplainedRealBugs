However, I think there are several good arguments for us making this change:\r\n* It does improve testability of various things and allows custom comparisons, as you've noted\r\n* It's only slower in the case that you are doing an `==` comparison against something that isn't even a BaseModel; this seems pretty unlikely to be happening in \"hot\" code\r\n* Even though it's noticeably slower, it's still pretty fast, at approximately 4M comparisons/second on my local machine.\r\n* This is what `dataclasses` does:

change.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/1526721788/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9126108477,"node_id":"AE_lADOBWBCuM5kl6iNzwAAAAIf9V09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/9126108477","actor":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-28T15:32:14Z","assignee":{"login":"Kludex","id":7353520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTM1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7353520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex","html_url":"https://github.com/Kludex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9131523830,"node_id":"AE_lADOBWBCuM5kl6iNzwAAAAIgR_72","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/9131523830","actor":{"login":"Kludex","id":7353520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTM1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7353520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex","html_url":"https://github.com/Kludex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kludex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-30T01:46:03Z","assignee":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api

#5622 \r\n\r\nChanges from returning `False` in `BaseModel` equality checks to telling python to look at the implementation from the other side of the `==`. I did some investigation in https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/5622 which I will copy below:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n_Quoting [this comment](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/5622#issuecomment-1526721788)_\r\n\r\nI did a little benchmarking of this:\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\nclass MyModel(BaseModel):\r\n    a: int\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass MyDataclass:\r\n    a: int\r\n\r\nm1 = MyModel(a=1)\r\nm2 = MyDataclass(a=1)\r\nt0 = time.time()\r\nfor _ in range(10_000_000):\r\n    m1 == m2\r\nt1 = time.time()\r\n\r\nprint(f\"elapsed: {t1-t0:.3f}s\")\r\n# with return False:          elapsed: 1.793s\r\n# with return NotImplemented: elapsed: 2.581s, 43% slower\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, it runs _significantly_ slower with `return NotImplemented` vs. `return False`. However, I think there are several good arguments for us making this change:\r\n* It does improve testability of various things and allows custom comparisons, as you've noted\r\n* It's only slower in the case that you are doing an `==` comparison against something that isn't even a BaseModel; this seems pretty unlikely to be happening in \"hot\" code\r\n* Even though it's noticeably slower, it's still pretty fast, at approximately 4M comparisons/second on my local machine.\r\n* This is what `dataclasses` does: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d2e2e53f733f8c8098035bbbc452bd1892796cb3/Lib/dataclasses.py#L669-L671\r\n\r\nGiven all the above points, I'll open a PR making this change.\n\nSelected Reviewer: @samuelcolvin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/5662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/5662/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9157960107,"node_id":"CE_lADOBWBCuM5kl6iNzwAAAAIh22Gr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/9157960107","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-03T17:08:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9157960165,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBWBCuM5kl6iNzwAAAAIh22Hl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/events/9157960165","actor":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"af29dbfcd3fc0ea4b511eaa0978f592df2e2da73","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/commits/af29dbfcd3fc0ea4b511eaa0978f592df2e2da73","created_at":"2023-05-03T17:08:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
