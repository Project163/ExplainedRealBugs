what's happening is that it's showing you, for each option in the union, why it can't be that option. The first option was PositiveInt, which fails. The second is None, which also fails (obviously).\r\n\r\nThis is because `Optional[PositiveInt]` is basically the same as `Union[PositiveInt, None]`.\r\n\r\n@samuelcolvin I feel like maybe some of this stuff has changed in v1 anyway; not sure whether the error messages still look the same?
