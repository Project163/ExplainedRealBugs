then follow the default workflow. But now we can use `metadata` in `dataclasses.field` or directly a `pydantic.Field` instance. We hence ignore the information set in the `Config`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short summary of the changes. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue number\r\nCloses #2426\r\n<!-- Are there any issues opened that
