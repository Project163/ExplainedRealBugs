We should have noticed this.\r\n\r\nAgreed 😕.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI think it would be pretty easy to add support for single-element tuples provided to `create_model` as a field definition, and to use the same logic for those as though you hadn't specified a default value for the field (that way, for example `fields = {'field1': (str,), 'field2': (Optional[str],)}` would work the way one would expect). I don't think this would be a breaking change since right now you can't specify non-pairs there anyway (but let me know if I'm missing something). Also, given `create_model` typically shouldn't be getting called in hot loops or with any substantial frequency, I don't think the performance implications related to adding a tuple-length check pose any issue.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't mitigate the need to change code to make create_model work as it did before for optional fields (since `...` always means required now), but I think ultimately it would provide more consistency.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/559869386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmontagu","id":35119617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTE5NjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35119617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmontagu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmontagu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/comments/559878974","html_url":"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1047#issuecomment-559878974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pydantic/pydantic/issues/1047","id":559878974,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTg3ODk3NA==","user":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-29T20:50:51Z","updated_at":"2019-11-29T20:50:51Z","body":"I agree it would be more consistent and a good idea.
