+Contributing to Pydantic
+------------------------
+
+We'd love you to contribute to *pydantic*, it should be extremely simple to get started and create a Pull Request.
+*pydantic* is released regularly so you should see your improvements release in a matter of days or weeks.
+
+If you're looking for something to get your teeth into, check out the
+`"help wanted" <https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`_
+label on github.
+
+To make contributing as easy and fast as possible, you'll want to run tests and linting locally. Luckily since
+*pydantic* has few dependencies, doesn't require compiling and tests don't need access to databases etc., setting
+up and running tests should be very simple.
+
+You'll need to have **python 3.6** or **3.7**, **virtualenv**, **git**, and **make** installed.
+
+.. literalinclude:: examples/contributing.sh
+  :language: bash
+
+**tl;dr**: use ``make format`` to fix formatting & ``make`` to run tests and linting.
