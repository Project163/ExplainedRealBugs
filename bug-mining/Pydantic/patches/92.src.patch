+### Difference with stdlib dataclasses
+
+Note that the `dataclasses.dataclass` from python stdlib implements only the `__post_init__` method since it doesn't run a validation step.
+
+When substituting usage of `dataclasses.dataclass` with `pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass`, it is recommended to move the code executed in the `__post_init__` method to the `__post_init_post_parse__` method, and only leave behind part of code which needs to be executed before validation.
