found an issue when using a Theory.\nThose 2 tests fails :\n\n```\n[Theory,\nInlineData(typeof(int[]), new int[]{ 1, 2, 3}),\nInlineData(typeof(string[]), new string[] { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" })    \n]\npublic void TheoryShouldRetrieveCorrectType(Type type, object value)\n{\n    Assert.IsType(type, value);\n}\n```\n\nWhat is happening is that the type of `value` is `object[]` instead of `int[]`.\nI believe that we should retrieve the exact type that was passed to the InlideData attribute.\n\nThe issue does not occur with MemberData.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
