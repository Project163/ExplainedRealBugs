Positive validation.\n   I only care that Save does not throw a `ValidationException` when fields are valid, but I don't care whether it's actually saved correctly (other tests check that).\n2. Mass theory.\n   Consider a decompiler. I write a lot of detailed tests on specific case. But I can also make a Theory that feeds it all methods from a bunch of assemblies, just to check if there is some unexpected edge case. I can't give a reasonable expectation for each row in this Theory -- and \"not throwing\" is a good indicator to see which ones should be tested more.\n3. \"Does it work under those conditions\"\n   This one is similar to the validation tests in that there are other tests for actual functionality, but you want to see if system does not fail under a certain condition. Some examples: does the action complete if MSDTC is disabled? does the action complete if it is run in parallel 10000 times? Some of them can check actual output, but sometimes you don't care much -- it should just not fail.\n4. \"More detailed test TBD\"\n   Not that great from purist perspective, but sometimes you want to get a test in, and then improve on it. This test might be non-essential/nice-to-have, or the requirements/design might be in flux -- sometimes having a not-throws is more valuable than nothing at all.\n\n> Also, in case you haven't tried it, we have a source-based NuGet package for the Assert class, which is delivered as a multi-file partial class. That makes it trivial to bring in the existing assert library and then add whichever asserts you feel are missing.\n\nSure, and I can add `AssertEx.DoesNotThrow` just as easily. However realistically I can't tell juniors on other projects \"you just need to get an extra class that does nothing if you want your tests to be descriptive\".

assert\nAssert.Null(ex);\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/86584802/reactions","total_count":22,"+1":22,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adamralph","id":677704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzcwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/677704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph","html_url":"https://github.com/adamralph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamralph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/86594419","html_url":"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/188#issuecomment-86594419","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/188","id":86594419,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTk0NDE5","user":{"login":"ploeh","id":242165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjE2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh","html_url":"https://github.com/ploeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ploeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-26T16:06:08Z","updated_at":"2015-03-26T16:06:08Z","body":"@adamralph
