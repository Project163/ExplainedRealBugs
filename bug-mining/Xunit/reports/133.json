A few months ago, when using the extension in Visual Studio I would receive source info in the Test Explorer so that I could double click the test to navigate to it, however this doesnt seem to be working anymore. After looking for a few hours it I am at a loss as to why this doesnt work anymore. I have a suspicion that it has to do with the new feature in VS where VS can enumerate your tests without building (When looking at `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestWindow.Extensions.VsSourceInformationProvider` in `TestWindow.Dotnet.Core.dll` I can see that it is using the type's FQN to reflect on source info. Is the `ISourceInformation` on `ITestCase` not used anymore? (edited)\r\n\r\n**Christopher Haws [09:43]** \r\n\r\n> @bradwilson I believe the issue with source info is happening here: https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/master/src/xunit.runner.visualstudio/Sinks/VsDiscoverySink.cs#L100\r\n\r\n> For .NET Core test projects, VSTest is sending false for `RequireSourceInformation`. I made a simple test adapter to play around with this and no matter what I do VSTest sends false here. If I ignore the fact that it sends false and set the source info anyways, it does work properly.\r\n\r\n**Brad Wilson [08:16]** \r\n\r\n> As I'm looking at that code, I'm not 100% sure why that test is there. There is no cost savings to be had, because the descriptor is a local object (not across the app domain).","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/1619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/1619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
