We aren't taking a direct dependency on JSON.NET, but rather indirectly through [`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel/1.0.0):\r\n\r\n![NuGet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16944/31578016-bc49b6d6-b0cd-11e7-8ccf-6fc1aa750a60.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the component responsible for parsing the `.deps.json` (aka, the dependency list) associated with your unit test project. Because that's where the dependency lies, we don't even know yet that you wanted a newer (maybe compatible, maybe not) version of JSON.NET, so we can't just load yours instead of ours and \"hope for the best\".\r\n\r\nThe only way for us to remove this dependency would be for us to copy the source code to Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel (and, recursively, all of its non-Platform-shipped dependencies ☹️) and then re-write the bits that are using JSON.NET to use some other parser.\r\n\r\nI've already brought this issue up (on Twitter) with some people at Microsoft, but I'm surprised to see someone hitting it already. They've told me that they have no plans to fix it at this time, and the earliest place they could fix it would be in 3.0 (because removing the JSON.NET dependency is considered by them to be a breaking change). /cc @damianedwards @davidfowl
