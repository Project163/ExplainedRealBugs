quick note about this list... It represents a moment in time for planning for a final list of v3 features. Until items are checked off, there is no guarantee that the feature will make it into v3. We reserve the right to rearrange and modify this list at will as we work through the issues and decide whether we can and will implement them.\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\n- #2329\r\n- #2330\r\n- #2331\r\n- #2332\r\n- #2017\r\n- #2126\r\n- #621\r\n- #2427\r\n- #2547 \r\n- #2457 \r\n- #1779\r\n\r\n## Core Framework\r\n\r\n- #2333\r\n- #2100\r\n- #2334\r\n- #1770\r\n- #2004\r\n- #1711\r\n- #1777\r\n- #2297\r\n- #1758\r\n- #1947\r\n- #1698\r\n- #2343\r\n- #1948\r\n- #2518\r\n- #2545\r\n- #2371\r\n- #2535 \r\n- #2439\r\n- #2726\r\n- #2557\r\n- #2629\r\n- #2335\r\n- #2963\r\n- #2951\r\n- #2339\r\n- #1730\r\n\r\n## Assertion Library\r\n\r\n- #2336\r\n- #1966\r\n- #1919\r\n- #2074\r\n- #1931\r\n- #1924\r\n- #1293\r\n- #1984\r\n- #1604\r\n- #1920\r\n- #2352\r\n- #2439\r\n- #2727\r\n- #2049\r\n- #1932\r\n- #2367\r\n- #2271\r\n\r\n## Runner Library\r\n\r\n- #2337\r\n- #2947\r\n- #2952\r\n\r\n## Runners\r\n\r\n- #1871\r\n- #1934\r\n- #1832\r\n- #2084\r\n- #2397\r\n- #2188\r\n- #2605\r\n- #1811\r\n- #1833\r\n- #1874\r\n\r\n## Extensibility\r\n\r\n- #2338\r\n\r\n## Bugs/Small Features\r\n\r\n- #1907\r\n- #2008\r\n- #2221\r\n- #1822\r\n- #2016\r\n- #2232\r\n- https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit/issues/266\r\n- #2418 \r\n- #2366\r\n- #2396\r\n- #2651\r\n- #2704\r\n- #1857\r\n- #2342\r\n- #1985\r\n- #2162\r\n- #2357\r\n- #1916\r\n- #2377\r\n- #2222\r\n\r\n## Open Questions/Further Discussion Required\r\n\r\n- #1727\r\n- #1724\r\n- #2612\r\n- #1845\r\n- #1896\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- All source uses tabs now instead of spaces ([reasoning](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/c8drjo/nobody_talks_about_the_real_reason_to_use_tabs/))\r\n- Move VSTest plugin (`xunit.runner.visualstudio`) to its [own project](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/2133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/2133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3682223787,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY4MjIyMzc4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/events/3682223787","actor":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"51dedf06b36840683c3a1482c56f78f0c511a1e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/commits/51dedf06b36840683c3a1482c56f78f0c511a1e9","created_at":"2020-08-22T18:26:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12828014379,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJbtsc4lXKyGzwAAAAL8m_cr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/events/12828014379","actor":{"login":"4creators","id":801959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTk1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/801959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators","html_url":"https://github.com/4creators","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4creators/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"51dedf06b36840683c3a1482c56f78f0c511a1e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/4creators/xunit/commits/51dedf06b36840683c3a1482c56f78f0c511a1e9","created_at":"2024-05-16T07:01:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
