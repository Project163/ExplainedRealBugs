It's about exception capture, but any assertions made about those exceptions are separate.\n\nE.g. I use FluentAssertions, so when writing tests using 2.0 I will be installing xunit.core rather than xunit, but I still want `Record.Exception()` since I still want a mechanism to capture exceptions during the 'act' part of my test method. My assertions about those exceptions will take place later in the 'assert' part of test method, using FluentAssertions.\n\nE.g.\n\n``` C#\n// arrange\nvar sut = new Foo();\n\n// act\nvar exception = Record.Exception(() => sut.Bar(null));\n\n// assert\nexception.ShouldBeOfType<ArgumentNullException>();\n```\n\n`Record.Exception()`, by it's nature, will always belong somewhere _before_ assertion so it should be located outside any assertion library.\n\n`Assert.Throws()` is clearly about assertion and should stay where it is, although personally I never use it, since it mixes action and assertion.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
