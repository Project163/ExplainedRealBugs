Specifically when the type in question lives outside the executing assembly. Null is passed instead of the type.\n\nFor example\n\n```\npublic class Tests\n{\n     [Theory]\n     [InlineData(typeof(int))]\n     [InlineData(typeof(string))]\n     [InlineData(typeof(MyType))]\n     [InlineData(typeof(ExternalType))]\n     [InlineData(typeof(GridLength))]\n     [InlineData(typeof(SqlCommand))]\n     public void TypeOfTests(Type type)\n     {\n         Assert.NotNull(type);\n     }\n}\n\npublic class MyType{}\n```\n\nThis test will fail both for `GridLength` which lives in `PresentationFramework.dll`  and `SqlCommand` who lives in `System.Data.dll`\n\nIn this example `ExternalType` is a type which can be found in another project in this solution.\n\nI have pushed  a small sample which shows this here https://github.com/ammeep/XunitTypeBug\n\nLoving the work on Xunit 2.0 :sparkles:  Let me know if there is anything I can do to contribute or provide to help :smile: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":243797184,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQzNzk3MTg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/events/243797184","actor":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"d8253851e5d62d175bdee27bf80c3ff679af0ef9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/commits/d8253851e5d62d175bdee27bf80c3ff679af0ef9","created_at":"2015-02-28T18:16:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/76587011","html_url":"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/326#issuecomment-76587011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/326","id":76587011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTg3MDEx","user":{"login":"AlexanderSher","id":8933858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MzM4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8933858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderSher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderSher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-01T07:55:37Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T07:55:37Z","body":"So if I understand it right, the problem is in the assembly deserialization -
