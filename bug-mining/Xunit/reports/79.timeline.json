is a bug here, but it's not what you think it is.\n\nThe fix (for you) is simple: xUnit.net does not support test data attributes with internal constructors. Change the constructor to public, and the problem will go away. The test data class itself can remain internal.\n\nThe bug in xUnit.net is that it should be reporting an error for this test case because it violates the rule, but it does not; instead, it does not discover the test.\n\nThe secondary bug (which caused most of your confusion here, I think) is that the Resharper runner _**should never have discovered the test in the first place**_. Therefore, you should open an issue against the Resharper runner (at https://github.com/xunit/resharper-xunit) for this additional bug.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/124880376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":365315293,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzY1MzE1Mjkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/events/365315293","actor":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-07-25T21:51:53Z","rename":{"from":"Theory with custom attribute having internal access modifier causes downstream tests not to run","to":"Theory data with internal constructor should generate a failure"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/124901794","html_url":"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/465#issuecomment-124901794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/465","id":124901794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDkwMTc5NA==","user":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-25T21:53:21Z","updated_at":"2015-07-25T21:56:20Z","body":"The fix for this is to return a single (failing) test case which indicates the missing constructor.
