trying to analyze NUnit-compatible xml output by XUnit via Sonars C#/NUnit parser it complains about at least one missing attribute, \"errors\", and I would guess it could miss more than that.\nI checked the NUnit schema definition (for V2, version 2.5): \nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/XML-Formats\nhttp://nunit.org/files/testresult_schema_25.txt\n\nand compared to NUnitXml.xslt, located here:\nhttps://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/master/src/xunit.console/NUnitXml.xslt\n\nI can see that some missing transformations for attributes, one is the \"errors\" attribute mentioned above.\n\nCould you add transformations for missing attributes to the xslt file?\nSome attributes do not have an exact match that I can see in XUnit xml format but some can likely be mapped anyway, for example \"inconclusive\" could be mapped to \"skipped\" or \"failed\".\n","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
