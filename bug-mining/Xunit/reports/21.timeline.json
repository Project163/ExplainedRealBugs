\n\nI've been looking for a while for a test framework that would let me run browser based tests in parallel and it looks like xUnit has most of the required features. I blogged a detailed analysis here ([http://www.pabich.eu/2014/06/how-to-run-selenium-tests-in-parallel.html](http://www.pabich.eu/2014/06/how-to-run-selenium-tests-in-parallel.html)) but I will include all important information here so the discussion is self-contained. The purpose of this discussion is to see whether those missing features fit into the vision of the xUnit project and if so, how they can be implemented. Personally I believe that the famous extensibility capabilites of xUnit could help here a lot (e.g. custom test execution pipeline via a custom implementation of XUnitTestCase). And having one, instead of many frameworks, has its obvious adventages.   \n\nI forked xUnit [https://github.com/pawelpabich/xunit](https://github.com/pawelpabich/xunit) to see if I can fill the gaps. This was easier than I thought it would be thanks to great condition the xUnit codebase is in. The whole excercise is more a Proof of Concept then a fully blown implementation but it works and it is used successfully in production.\n\nI split the missing features into 3 groups: \n- must have (without them browser based tests won't be possible with xUnit),\n- should have (very,very usefull and it will make life much easier but not deal breakers)\n- nice to have (there is no rush to add those, but eventually it would good to have them)\n## Must haves\n### Report test result back to the test before it gets disposed\n\nTests need to know when they fail so a screenshot of the web browser can be taken. [Current solution checks whether the test class implements certain interfaces, e.g. INeedToKnowTestFailure](https://github.com/pawelpabich/xunit/commit/77d79aa316dc57950c9f5c110dc72f25111f7127). \n### Execute the whole test as a single Task\n\nCurrent design splits the execution pipline into mutliple tasks which means that Dispose method of an already executed test might be run with some delay which means more browser instances will be required than what MaxParallelThreads would suggest. In my tests I very often ended up with 2 or 3 x MaxParallelThreads number of browsers. [Current solution is to execute the whole pipleline as a single Task](https://github.com/pawelpabich/xunit/commit/7fa0f32a1f831f8aef55a8ff7ee6db0dfb88a8cd)\n## Should haves\n### Make unit of work more granular\n\nAt the moment the smalles unit of work for parallel processing is class. For long running tests this is not optimal as a class with a few long running tests can significantly slow down the whole build. [Current solution introduces a new, per method, collection bahaviour.](https://github.com/pawelpabich/xunit/commit/7fa0f32a1f831f8aef55a8ff7ee6db0dfb88a8cd)\n### Allow to order test collections\n\nAssuming that we can have a test collection per test methed then the next logical step to minimize the exectuion time would be to have ability to order test collections to make sure the failed tests or/and tests with longest execution time are run first. [Current solution is based on the existing extensibilty point for ordering tests within a test collection.](https://github.com/pawelpabich/xunit/commit/74eb583589f01711137a754d7b90e5b7a79bb1e4)\n## Nice to haves\n### Allow to perform global initalization\n\nAt the moment global [initialization needs to happen in the instance constructor with global lock.](https://github.com/pawelpabich/SeleniumWithXunit/blob/master/SeleniumWithXunit/Infrastructure/BaseTest.cs?#L48-58)\n### Allow to perform global clean up\n\nCurrent workaround relies on [subscription to AppDomain.Unload](https://github.com/pawelpabich/SeleniumWithXunit/blob/master/SeleniumWithXunit/Infrastructure/TestRun.cs?#L16) event which works most of the time but not always.\n\nI really hope we can make it work :).
