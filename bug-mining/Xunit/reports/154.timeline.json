Should there, for example, be a way to run only explicit tests (f.e., `-explicit only`)?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't even introduce a command line parameter, because it turns everything topsy-turvy: when a test method or class is marked `[Explicit]`, the only way to run this method or class should be by using `-class` or `-method`, as this is the explicit pendant on the CLI to the UI.  \r\nAn `-explicit` parameter would somehow water this explicitness.\r\n\r\n> Should `-class` run explicit tests in the given class?

Like I've said though, I'm expecting this shouldn't restrict IDEs from silently adding an \"explicit\" option when only explicit tests are requested (so the \"explicit\" option is invisible to the user).\r\n\r\nYeah, we should separate the GUI from the CLI from a usability standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn the GUI, you will see which tests were not run because of explicit, and you can select it/them to run them explicitly. I believe this is how other frameworks work today, so this should be fine.\r\n\r\nIn the CLI, the way I see it there are two potentially competing/complementary options (`-method` and `-explicit`). I believe that, for sure, `-explicit` is a necessary option, because ease of use would suggest you'd want options like `-explicit off` (default), `-explicit on`, and `-explicit only`. So then the remaining question is should `-method` run an explicit method in the absence of the `-explicit` option? (And how about explicit data rows in a test method?)\r\n\r\nI'm currently leaning towards \"from the CLI, the only way to run explicit tests is with `-explicit on` or `-explicit only`\" regardless of usage of `-method`. This could be supplemented by logic which says if you've asked to run a filtered list of tests, and it ended up running nothing because everything you selected was explicit, it could say \"Did you mean to add `-explicit on`?\"","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/1121400982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/1121650215","html_url":"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2518#issuecomment-1121650215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/2518","id":1121650215,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAJbtsc5C2wYn","user":{"login":"markm77","id":26673915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjczOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26673915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77","html_url":"https://github.com/markm77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markm77/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T22:37:42Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T22:37:42Z","body":"@bradwilson

through the system as they see fit. For `[Fact]` and friends, this gets surfaced on the test case:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/8af64f2f810911ed8aefc3f19517ba78620e7827/src/xunit.v3.core/Sdk/v3/Abstractions/IXunitTestCase.cs#L13-L16\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/8af64f2f810911ed8aefc3f19517ba78620e7827/src/xunit.v3.core/Sdk/v3/TestCases/XunitTest.cs#L43-L44\r\n\r\nThis opens up extensibility opportunities to express explicit-ness at any layer, since `_ITest` is the lowest layer in the stack. I may later introduce `Explicit` as something you could set on an individual data row, and others could come and introduce class-level `[Explicit]` attributes that filter down into test cases and tests in the same way that `[Fact(Explicit)]` filters down from the test case into the test today.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/1179631103/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/comments/1180073604","html_url":"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2518#issuecomment-1180073604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/2518","id":1180073604,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAJbtsc5GVn6E","user":{"login":"mu88","id":4560672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjA2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4560672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88","html_url":"https://github.com/mu88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu88/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-11T07:46:00Z","updated_at":"2022-07-11T07:46:00Z","body":"Thx for your awesome work once again, @bradwilson!
