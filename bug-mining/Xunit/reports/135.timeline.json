@redknightlois \r\n\r\nNote: I've updated all the netcoreapp targets to netcoreapp2.1 but there is no such thing as netstandard2.1, we can either add NuGet packages that we want to use (they cover most of the functionality that .NET Core 2.1 has) or add target 'netcoreapp2.1' (like in Sparrow.csproj). I think (if needed) it is OK to do so in internal projects like Voron, but releasing client with that target decreases the reachability only to .NET Core 2.1+ apps (so we have to release other targets also), so please have it in mind.\r\n\r\nNote:  I would appreciate a review of the code changes that I've made.
