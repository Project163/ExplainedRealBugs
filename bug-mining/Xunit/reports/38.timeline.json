It is even more important in the context of xbehave, since the 'act' is captured in it's own step delegate and therefore needs to capture an exception for assertion to take place in later step delegates.\n\n``` C#\n\"Given a foo\"\n    .f(() => sut = new Foo());\n\n\"When I Bar with a null Baz\"\n    .f(() => exception = Record.Exception(() => sut.Bar(null)));\n\n\"Then an argument null exception should be thrown\"\n    .f(() => exception.ShouldBeOfType<ArgumentNullException>());\n```\n\nI don't want xbehave to take a dep on xunit (with xunit.assert) just to bring `Record.Exception` into the
