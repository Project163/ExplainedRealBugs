Summary\r\nThis PR is refactoring `ConsensusReactorTest`, `ReactorTest` majorly.\r\n\r\n+ Change `CreateReator` abstract to the concrete method.\r\n+ `ReactorTest` defines and creates required objects to create `ConsensusReactor` in `ConsensusReactorTest`.\r\n+ Some clean-up and bugfix created from https://github.com/planetarium/libplanet/pull/2100\r\n+ Move `IncreaseRoundWhenTimeout` to
