\"Overview\" tab that displays failed tests details does not contain test output produced using ITestOutputHelper,\nExample test:\n\n```\n    public class ExperimentLogging1\n    {\n        private readonly ITestOutputHelper _testOutputHelper;\n\n        public ExperimentLogging1(ITestOutputHelper testOutputHelper)\n        {\n            _testOutputHelper = testOutputHelper;\n        }\n\n

xunit.console.exe with -teamcity flag.\nTeacity version is: TeamCity Professional 8.1.2 (build 29993) \n\nActual output in Teamcity 'Overview' tab is:\n\n```\nAssert.False() Failure\nExpected: False\nActual:   True\n   at SeleniumProject.Tests.ExperimentLogging1.should_1() in c:\\BuildAgent\\work\\89531219da7d8e23\\SeleniumProject\\SeleniumProject\\Tests\\ExperimentLogging.cs\n```\n\nNOTE: The 'Build Log' tab does not contain output either. \nNOTE: Resharper runner works correctly and produces the following output:\n\n```\nCustom test output\n\nXunit.Sdk.FalseExceptionAssert.False() Failure\n\nExpected: False\n\nActual:   True\n   at SeleniumProject.Tests.ExperimentLogging1.should_1() in ExperimentLogging.cs\n```\n\nThe expected behavior is that Teamcity 'Overview' tab contains test output\n","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
