my test suite I am rolling up a non-trivial number of test cases. I mean a seriously large number of them. This is unavoidable in order to property verify functionality. In prior versions of ``Xunit`` this would work just fine. The roll up itself would take some time, but the tests at least kept running, particularly if I was running these tests in conjunction with others in my test sessions.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems with the latest version of ``Xunit`` this is breaking down and others among my unit tests are timing out with *inconclusive\".\r\n\r\nFirst, is there a way to put a hold on tests until the member data test cases have rolled up?\r\n\r\nSecond, is there a timeout I can set, disable, etc?\r\n\r\nTypically, I am approaching member data test cases something like this:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nprivate static IEnumerable<object[]> _memberDataTestCases;\r\n\r\npublic static IEnumerable<object[]> MemberDataTestCases\r\n{\r\n    get\r\n    {\r\n        IEnumerable<object[]> GetAll()\r\n        {\r\n            IEnumerable<object> GetOne(...)\r\n            {\r\n                yield return someArgs;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            yield return GetOne(...).ToArray();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return _memberDataTestCases ?? (_memberDataTestCases = GetAll().ToArray());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDepending on the test case, ``GetOne(...)`` or variations thereof can be more or less complex.\r\n\r\nIn this case I've got some 15,125+ for a given test case.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this was not a problem before the most recent ``Xunit`` release. So whatever changed between then and now has had an adverse effect on rolling up a range of tests, test cases, etc, timing out.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/1834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/1834/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-12T12:31:40Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T12:31:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aleks-ivanov/Polly/issues/5","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aleks-ivanov/Polly","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aleks-ivanov/Polly/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aleks-ivanov/Polly/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aleks-ivanov/Polly/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/aleks-ivanov/Polly/pull/5","id":830074300,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTkxNjQxMTA3","number":5,"title":"Bump
