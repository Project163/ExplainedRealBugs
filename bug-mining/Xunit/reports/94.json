We currently using MSTests and it's quite simple to do - you get call stack of the current method, find the one that has TestMethod attribute, get all CategoryAttribute instances and check if there is one with \"IntegrationTests\" as a name.\n\nIn xUnit I can get TraitAttribute programmatically but I can't get actual name and value from it, because the instance of TraitAttribute does not stores parameters passed to it's constructor. Is there a way to get traits from the method programmatically?\n","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
