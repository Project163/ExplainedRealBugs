Here's why:\r\n\r\nIn order to implement this behavior outside of xUnit, one has to override the `XunitTestAssemblyRunner` and then inject this custom test assembly runner into a custom test framework that overrides the xUnit test framework just enough to add the custom behavior. This is the case with https://github.com/kzu/xunit.assemblyfixture. This approach requires a full-blown test framework to be used in the test project. There are several custom test frameworks available out there, each one with its unique features. I.e. as a end-user I would like to order my test cases using https://github.com/tomaszeman/Xunit.Extensions.Ordering and also use the assembly fixture defined by @kzu . I can't do so because my test project can use only one test framework - which makes sense from a technical perspective. Fortunately @tomaszeman added this behavior to his framework, although it might not have been needed for ordering test cases (I suppose).\r\n\r\nThe way it looks to me, every test framework author has to add this behavior if their users request it. This could be an indication that this should not be regarded as an extension, but as core functionality that is currently missing from the xUnit framework. If you agree to this then I suggest this behavior:\r\n- add new type `IAssemblyFixture<>` that works similar to `IClassFixture<>` but at a higher scope (the test assembly)\r\n- design for extensibility to allow the test framework authors extend the functionality","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/1947/reactions","total_count":24,"+1":24,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/1947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
