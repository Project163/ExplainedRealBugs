I took the PriorityOrderer code from the TestCaseOrdering sample. \n\n```\n<package id=\"xunit\" version=\"2.0.0-rc3-build2880\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n<package id=\"xunit.abstractions\" version=\"2.0.0-rc3-build2880\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n<package id=\"xunit.assert\" version=\"2.0.0-rc3-build2880\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n<package id=\"xunit.core\" version=\"2.0.0-rc3-build2880\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n<package id=\"xunit.extensibility.core\" version=\"2.0.0-rc3-build2880\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n<package id=\"xunit.runner.visualstudio\" version=\"2.0.0-rc3-build1046\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\n```\n\nThe difference for me is that the tests are never run and remain in the \"Not Run Tests\" category in the Test Explorer. When I just 'Run' the tests, there is no failure reported in the Test Explorer. In a 'Debug' run of the tests, I get a NullReferenceException breakpoint in the editor stating it occurred in
