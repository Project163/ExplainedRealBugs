All other extensibility points should be able to be achieved through the use of `xunit.core.dll`.\n\nSome candidates for moving include:\n- `Xunit.Sdk.IDataDiscoverer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.ITestCaseOrderer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.ITraitDiscoverer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.IXunitDiscoverer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.IXunitTestCollectionFactory`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.XunitTestCase` (needs an interface introduced)\n\nWe should also consider moving any reasonable implementations that might be used as base classes into `xunit.core.dll` as well. Some candidates here include:\n- `Xunit.Sdk.DataDiscoverer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.DefaultTestCaseOrderer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.FactDiscoverer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.InlineDataDiscoverer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.TheoryDiscoverer`\n- `Xunit.Sdk.TraitDiscoverer`\n\nThe biggest stumbling block today is XunitTestCase, which uses non-PCL concepts like serialization and thus cannot be moved into `xunit.core.dll`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
