For the shared state, something along the lines of\n\n```\npublic class SharedState : IDisposable\n{\n    private static readonly object sync = new object();\n    protected static int Instances;\n\n    public SharedState()\n    {\n        lock (sync)\n        {\n            Instances++;\n            File.AppendAllLines(\"testlog.txt\", new [] { string.Format(\"{0,2} {1,3} {2}\", Instances, \"in\", this.GetType())});\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Dispose()\n    {\n        lock (sync)\n        {\n            Instances--;\n            File.AppendAllLines(\"testlog.txt\", new[] { string.Format(\"{0,2} {1,3} {2}\", Instances, \"out\", this.GetType()) });\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand then for the tests, ten test classes with ten test methods each along these lines:\n\n```\npublic class Class1 : SharedState\n{\n    [Fact]\n    public void Test1()\n    {\n        Assert.Equal(1, Instances);\n    }\n    ... 9 more of these\n}\n```\n\nThis results in many test failures, and a log file like\n\n```\n1  in MyTestLibrary.Class1\n2  in MyTestLibrary.Class10\n1 out MyTestLibrary.Class10\n2  in MyTestLibrary.Class10\n1 out MyTestLibrary.Class1\n0 out MyTestLibrary.Class10\n```\n\nshowing that the tests are executing in parallel.\n\nIf I additionally log the `ManagedThreadId` of the thread used on each test, I get two distinct thread IDs on my two-core system.\n\nHave I misunderstood this attribute or is it not working?\n","closed_by":{"login":"bradwilson","id":16944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xunit/xunit/issues/276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
