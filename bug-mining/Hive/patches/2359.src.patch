+            all classes from ql module, i.e. the same contents as hive-exec-$version.jar would
+            have had if there was shade plugin below.  The way shade was configured since 0.13, is
+            to override the default jar for ql module with the saded one but keep the same name.
+            In other words, ql modules producesd a single uber jar under the module's coordinates,
+            i.e. w/o a classifier.  We also need a slim jar that only has classes from ql.  This
+            jar will now be with a 'core' classifier to ensure that prior behavior is preserved.
+            It would have been better to have a slim jar called hive-exec-$version.jar and a fat
+            jar called hive-exec-$version-shaded.jar but doing this now will cause backwards compat.
