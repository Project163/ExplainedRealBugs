+Hive implements a dialect of SQL (Hive QL) that focuses on analytics

+subqueries, common table expressions and more. Hive allows SQL

-Please note that Hadoop is a batch processing system and Hadoop jobs
-tend to have high latency and incur substantial overheads in job
-submission and scheduling. Consequently the average latency for Hive
-queries is generally very high (minutes) even when data sets involved
-are very small (say a few hundred megabytes). As a result it cannot be
-compared with systems such as Oracle where analyses are conducted on a
-significantly smaller amount of data but the analyses proceed much
-more iteratively with the response times between iterations being less
-than a few minutes. Hive aims to provide acceptable (but not optimal)
-latency for interactive data browsing, queries over small data sets or
-test queries.

-Hive is not designed for online transaction processing and does not
-support real-time queries or row level insert/updates. It is best used
-for batch jobs over large sets of immutable data (like web logs). What
-Hive values most are scalability (scale out with more machines added
-dynamically to the Hadoop cluster), extensibility (with MapReduce
-framework and UDF/UDAF/UDTF), fault-tolerance, and loose-coupling with
-its input formats.
+Hive users have a choice of 2 runtimes when executing SQL queries.
+Users can choose to use the Apache Hadoop MapReduce framework,
+which is mature and proven at large scales. MapReduce is a purely
+batch framework, and queries run using the MapReduce framework
+may experience higher latencies (tens of seconds), even
+over small datasets. Alternatively, users can choose to use the
+newer Apache Tez framework to process SQL queries. Tez is
+designed for interactive query and has substantially reduced
+overheads versus MapReduce. Users are free to swtich back and
+forth between these frameworks at any time. In either case,
+Hive is best suited for use cases where the amount of data
+processed is large enough to require a distributed system.
