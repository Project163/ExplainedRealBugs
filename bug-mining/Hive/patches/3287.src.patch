     <description>The resources in this list will be localized to the node running LaunchMapper and added to HADOOP_CLASSPTH
       before launching 'hive' command.  If the path /foo/bar is a directory, the contents of the the entire dir will be localized
       and ./bar/* will be added to HADOOP_CLASSPATH.  Note that since classpath path processing does not recurse into subdirectories,
-      the paths in this property may be overlapping.  In the example above, "./tez-site.xml:./tez-client/*:./lib/*" will be added to
+      the paths in this property may be overlapping.  For example, to run Hive on Tez jobs, 3 items need to be localized:
+      /tez-client/conf/tez-site.xml,/tez-client/,/tez-client/lib.  In this example, "./tez-site.xml:./tez-client/*:./lib/*" will be added to
       HADOOP_CLASSPATH.
       This can be used to specify config files, Tez artifacts, etc.  This will be sent -files option of hadoop jar command thus
       each path is interpreted by Generic Option Parser.  It can be local or hdfs path.
