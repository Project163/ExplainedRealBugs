+For Hadoop 1.x you would need to upload hadoop-examples.jar twice to HDFS one as hclient.jar and other as hexamples.jar.
+For Hadoop 2.x you would need to upload hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient.jar to HDFS as hclient.jar and hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar to HDFS as hexamples.jar. 
 Also see http://hive.apache.org/docs/hcat_r0.5.0/rest_server_install.html#Hadoop+Distributed+Cache for notes on
 additional JAR files to copy to HDFS.
