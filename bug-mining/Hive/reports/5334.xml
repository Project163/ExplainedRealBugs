            <title>[HIVE-16081] allow &quot;0.23&quot; shim creation for Hadoop 3</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16081</link>
                <project id="12310843" key="HIVE">Hive</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We only have one shim, so for now, we are going to use that. Hopefully we won&apos;t need shims and build profiles for Hadoop 3&lt;/p&gt;</description>
