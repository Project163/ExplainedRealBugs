            <title>[HIVE-9609] AddPartitionMessage.getPartitions() can return null</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9609</link>
                <project id="12310843" key="HIVE">Hive</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;DbNotificationListener and NotificationListener both depend on AddPartitionEvent.getPartitions() to get their partitions to trigger a message, but this can be null if an AddPartitionEvent was initialized on a PartitionSpec rather than a List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, AddPartitionEvent seems to have a duality, where getPartitions() works only if instantiated on a List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;, and getPartitionIterator() works only if instantiated on a PartitionSpec.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So, I&apos;ve not messed with the current implementation of getPartitions. That said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mithun&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;mithun&quot;&gt;mithun&lt;/a&gt;, could you please comment if you&apos;re okay with me fixing getPartitions so that it doesn&apos;t return null in the case where it has been instantiated from a PartitionSpec? I could at the very least do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, to handle the base problem, we should fix AddPartitionEvent.getPartitionIterator to correctly work in correctly in both cases - this should at least not be controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we should change MessageFactory.buildAddPartitionMessage to work on Iterator&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt; rather than List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt; - this is trivially fixable, and have JSONMessageFactory use that instead, thereby solving our initial problem of getPartitions call from AddPartitionEvent not being usable in cases of events fired with PartitionSpec rather than List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="14312876" author="mithun" created="Mon, 9 Feb 2015 21:03:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hey, Sush. I heartily agree with the intention. It would be good to remove cases where all the partitions need to be loaded into memory at once. And for this, it makes sense to have AddPartitionEvent initializable only with an Iterator&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of the Iterable&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;. Perhaps the PartitionSpecProxy should have implemented Iterable&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did run into a problem (that I can&apos;t completely recollect). You&apos;ll notice that &lt;tt&gt;PartitionSpecProxy.PartitionIterator&lt;/tt&gt; has functionality that ideally belongs in &lt;tt&gt;Partition&lt;/tt&gt;, such as &lt;tt&gt;setCreateTime()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;putToParameters()&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. The reason is that subclasses (such as &lt;tt&gt;PartitionSpecWithSharedSDProxy&lt;/tt&gt;) construct Partition instances as needed, and won&apos;t be able to propagate setter-actions on Partitions to the underlying implementation. (At least, not without subclassing &lt;tt&gt;Partition&lt;/tt&gt; itself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m fine with changing the MessageFactory interface, and AddPartitionEvent initializers, to eschew &lt;tt&gt;List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; objects. We&apos;ll also need to change &lt;tt&gt;HiveMetaStore.fireMetaStoreAddPartitionEvent()&lt;/tt&gt; to conform to this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14313316" author="sushanth" created="Tue, 10 Feb 2015 01:15:48 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attaching more aggressive v2, removes the getPartitions() call altogether, removes PartitionSpecProxy usage and List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt; usage from MessageFactory.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14313359" author="sushanth" created="Tue, 10 Feb 2015 01:50:34 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Oh, one more thing. Changing HiveMetaStore.fireMetaStoreAddPartitionEvent() to eschew List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt; does not help us, unless we remove add_partitions itself, since we were sent in the List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt; already, and that is a call on which we should not break backward compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m retaining AddPartitionEvent as effectively a union of List&amp;lt;Partition&amp;gt;/PartitionSpec as it currently stands - but I am changing it so that the &quot;one true way&quot; of accessing AddPartitionEvent is through getPartitionIterator, which works correctly for both cases. In addition, I&apos;m outright removing the getPartitions() method that was there earlier and forcing use of the iterator, since that will not cause a PSpec-based add partitions to fail when the event is processed.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14317374" author="mithun" created="Thu, 12 Feb 2015 01:44:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the delay. I&apos;m going to need a little more time to study the second patch. I&apos;d like to get my head around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on first glance, I appreciate how streamlined &lt;tt&gt;AddPartitionEvent&lt;/tt&gt;&apos;s interface is now. I&apos;m even more taken by &lt;tt&gt;Iterators&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minor nitpicks:&lt;br/&gt;
1. Should we also change &lt;tt&gt;JSONMessageFactory.getPartitionKeyValues()&lt;/tt&gt; to return &lt;tt&gt;Iterator&amp;lt;Map&amp;lt;String,String&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;? Also, appropriately change &lt;tt&gt;JSONAddPartitionMessage&lt;/tt&gt; constructor? Perhaps not a big deal, given that these are just names. But then again, perhaps every little counts?&lt;br/&gt;
2. Shall we split &lt;tt&gt;JSONAddPartitionMessage.partitions&lt;/tt&gt; to include only part-values, and avoid the repetition of partition-key-names.&lt;br/&gt;
3. JSONMessageFactory.java imports &quot;java.util.*&quot;. That&apos;s likely my (code-editor&apos;s) doing. Could I please bother you to fix that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d like to do a similar change for DropPartitionEvent/Message. I&apos;ll raise a JIRA shortly.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14319274" author="mithun" created="Fri, 13 Feb 2015 00:03:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Actually, splitting out &lt;tt&gt;JSONAddPartitionMessage.partitions&lt;/tt&gt; into a &lt;tt&gt;List&amp;lt;PartitionKeyName&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;PartitionValues&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will be fairly intrusive. Separate JIRA, methinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JSONMessageDeserializer will need to provide backward compatibility, etc. Let&apos;s hold off on that change.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The changes are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9679&quot; title=&quot;Remove redundant null-checks from DbNotificationListener.&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HIVE-9679&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HIVE-9679&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="14484088" author="sushanth" created="Tue, 7 Apr 2015 21:24:00 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Mithun, per your previous comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) Making a change to JSONMessageFactory.getPartitionKeyValues() to Iterator semantics is more work than I thought initially, because it requires quite a bit of testing if we change the AddPartitionMessage also to use an Iterator instead of a List, since we&apos;re using automatic JSON generation in the JSONAddPartitionMessage, and that can handle Lists properly, but with Iterators, it might require more testing. If that does not itself change, then changing this signature from List to Iterator gains us nothing. It&apos;s definitely worth experimenting, and I will try to take another stab at it later. Also, if we&apos;re converting from Iterator to List at some point, Lists.newArrayList is supposed to be a pretty low-cost way of doing that.&lt;br/&gt;
b) Splitting JSONAddPartitionMessage.partitions, equally, is a lot more complex. Again, for a future jira.&lt;br/&gt;
c) Changing java.util.* - fixed. It was there from earlier, but good catch on it. It&apos;s better to remove these where we find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are some new tests that need fixing, I&apos;ve fixed those.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14484171" author="mithun" created="Tue, 7 Apr 2015 22:00:04 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;@&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sushanth&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;sushanth&quot;&gt;sushanth&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1-2. I agree with you, and hence, me again. (?!) &lt;tt&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;PartVal&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; might be doable, but we can hit that with a separate JIRA. The rest of the iterator stuff is pretty neat. I&apos;ll read through the updated patch more closely before +1-ing.&lt;br/&gt;
3. That was likely my (IDE&apos;s) doing. Much obliged, and many simultaneous apologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had recommended a change to &lt;tt&gt;AuthorizationPreEventListener.authorizeAddPartition&lt;/tt&gt; to use the alternative &lt;tt&gt;PartitionWrapper&lt;/tt&gt; constructor. (It&apos;s way faster.) But again, it&apos;s possible that that change distracts from our objective here. Separate JIRA?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;FYI, I&apos;ve raised &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10250&quot; title=&quot;Optimize AuthorizationPreEventListener to reuse TableWrapper objects&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HIVE-10250&quot;&gt;HIVE-10250&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;tt&gt;AuthPreEventListener&lt;/tt&gt; problem. I&apos;ll rebase &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10250&quot; title=&quot;Optimize AuthorizationPreEventListener to reuse TableWrapper objects&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HIVE-10250&quot;&gt;HIVE-10250&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9674&quot; title=&quot;*DropPartitionEvent should handle partition-sets.&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HIVE-9674&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HIVE-9674&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after we commit this one.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
