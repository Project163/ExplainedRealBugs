            <title>[HIVE-8368] compactor is improperly writing delete records in base file</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8368</link>
                <project id="12310843" key="HIVE">Hive</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;When the compactor reads records from the base and deltas, it is not properly dropping delete records.  This leads to oversized base files, and possibly to wrong query results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="14162037" author="alangates" created="Tue, 7 Oct 2014 16:12:04 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The issue comes out when input sizes are large enough that they exceed one map task.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch fixes it by turning on reduce deduplication in the optimizer (which was being turned off before) and dropping the minimum number of reducers to 1 (instead of 4).  This has the side effect of halving the time it takes to do an update or delete.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="14162265" author="alangates" created="Tue, 7 Oct 2014 18:31:39 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;This patch adds a new isDelete method to AcidInputFormat.RawReader.  The compactor then calls isDelete when getting records from RawReader and then throws them out if it is doing a major compaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note on adding isDelete.  I think it would be better to change RawReader.next to not return deleted records when the option compact is set to true.  Two things prevented me from doing this.  One, while I think no one ever needs deletes in the compact case I might be wrong.  Two, the loop that does the merge and returns the next record in RawReader.next is complicated code, and changing it looked very error prone.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
