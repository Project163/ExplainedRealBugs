It would also mean that we're iterative over a list every time rather than thinking through things more simply, and it makes debugging the option harder in the future, i.e., we always prefer the most

Maybe you could make it so that if the `flake8-per-file-ignores` plugin is selected, then the built-in functionality is disabled, and the plugin is used instead. Probably with a warning of some sort which points out that the plugin has mostly but not exactly the same functionality. Then people who are upgrading automatically and unknowingly depend on some old behaviour (I was in that situation) are not affected by any change. When they are actively changing the config for the new situation, they will notice the change, but that is a much better time for it because they are actively fixing things anyway.\n\nI realise that this is pretty much the opposite of how the plugin is handled now, but does that sound doable?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812802991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4547591457,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU0NzU5MTQ1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547591457","actor":{"login":"oseiberts11","id":36202147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjAyMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36202147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiberts11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T03:26:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4547591460,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NDc1OTE0NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547591460","actor":{"login":"oseiberts11","id":36202147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjAyMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36202147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11","html_url":"https://github.com/oseiberts11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oseiberts11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T03:26:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812802993","html_url":"https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/290#issuecomment-812802993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/290","id":812802993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjgwMjk5Mw==","user":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-03T03:26:24Z","updated_at":"202

But in practice I have several patterns, and several files with additional ignores.\n\nFrom what I've seen above, I understand that the way you want it, is to select a single line, without scanning several or all of them. I fear that in the general case this isn't possible. If there are several wildard patterns that match a particular file name, which one are you going to choose? Why? \n\nAnd in the general case, you cannot just point to \"the best pattern\" without examining several of them. To give a simple example, with patterns like\n\n```\na/b/c/*\na/b/*/d\na/*/c/d\n*/b/c/d\na/b/*/*\na/*/c/*\n*/*/*/d\n```\nand file names like `a/b/c/d`, `a/x/c/d`, `a/b/x/d`, the names will match multiple patterns, and/or they will have different \"best\" patterns. You cannot (in an obviously understandable way) say ahead of time which pattern is \"best\". Even if you manage to create a total ordering, for many potential file names you will need to try several patterns *anyway* until you find a match.\n\nSince trying to explain to a user how this works is too complicated (and I'm not even talking about implementing it), just scanning all patterns and applying all matches is much easer to understand, and much easier to implement.\n\n(There seems to be a bug in the implementation already, viz. that the `machinedb/**/*.py` pattern didn't seem to match any files at all for me.
