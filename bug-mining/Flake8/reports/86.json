It exists in \n\n- `mypy` for Python (and `pytest` too)\n- `eslint` for Javascript\n- `credo` for Elixir\n- `rust-clippy` for Rust\n\nAnd only `flake8` is missing this feature.\n\nWhy is it awesome? Imagine that you have a big project and lots of plugins, even big ones (like https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide). It takes a LOT of time to run `flake8 .` on your code. Sometimes I can even ignore it locally and push directly to the CI, hoping that everything is going to be ok.\n\nAnother option is to run several changed files only manually. It is not very useful. \nYou can also rely on external tools like `pre-commit` or `flakehell`. Or even IDE. Which is ok, but it is kind of strange. Because looks like this should be a *default* behaviour. or at least a core feature.\n\nAdding cache will allow users to rerun checks only on changed files, or when plugins are modified, or when the configuration is changed. This will significantly improve the build time.\n\nThere's already a working implementation of the caching feature in `flake8` wrapper called `flakehell`. So, we can adapt this approach from there.\nPR: https://github.com/life4/flakehell/pull/33\n\nOr come up with something different.\nI can work on this during the holiday season.","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/329/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
