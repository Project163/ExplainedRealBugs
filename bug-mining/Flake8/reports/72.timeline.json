On top of the problems we\nencountered previously in GitLab#237, it's now apparent that\nSyntaxErrors can also occur across multiple lines (in fact, across the\nrest of a file). In the event of a \"multi-line\" SyntaxError, we need to\ndetermine what row to report and what the column number is.\n\nFor now, we're going to use the row number of the first line and limit\nthe column number to be less than the end of the line. It may not be\nperfect, but it is slightly better.\n\nRelated-to #237  \nCloses #259 \n\ncc @arcanemagus","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
