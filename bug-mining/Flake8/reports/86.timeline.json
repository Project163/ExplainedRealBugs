GitLab by @sobolevn on Dec 23, 2019, 03:04\n\nGood question! Let's dig into it.\n\n> where the cache lives\n\nI guess that the cache should live relative to the found config (if it is not a global one). I would say that `.flake8cache` `json`-based file looks like the best option. There might be a problem with `.gitignore`, but we can update global defaults for new projects and list this file as excluded from VCS in the docs. Another option is to hack `__pycache__` or similar. But, I don't like it: these files are removed by different tools at random. It is not reliable. \n\n> what the cache looks like, what invalidates the cache\n\nWe can have a look at `eslint` cache file for an inspiration.\n\n<details>\n<code>\n» cat
