GitLab by @robert.peteuil on Apr 28, 2017, 13:40\n\n## Environment\r\n\r\nflake8 installed via pip, along with pyflakes, pycodestyle, radon and mccabe as seen here:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$flake8

`--radon-max-cc=1` parameter does not display radon errors\r\n- The -vv results show that it finds them, but ignores them.\r\n- This can be easily reproduced as in the **Error Example** session.  \r\n\r\n## Error Example\r\n\r\n**Flake8 3.3.0 results for command `flake8 awss/__init__.py --radon-max-cc=1 -v`:**\r\n- Note: only relevant portion of output included.\r\n\r\n```\r\nflake8.checker
