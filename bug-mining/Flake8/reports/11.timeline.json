GitLab by @christianmlong on Mar 16, 2015, 17:22\n\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the tests in this module pass when this module is run on its own, but they fail when this module is run as part of the whole test suite. These are the problematic tests:\r\n\r\n    test_jobs_verbose\r\n    test_stdin_jobs_warning\r\n\r\nOn some platforms, the warnings.capture_warnings function doesn't work properly when run with the other flake8 tests. It drops some warnings, even though the warnings filter is set to 'always'. However, when run separately, these tests pass.\r\n\r\nThis problem only occurs on Windows, with Python 3.3 and older. Maybe it's related to [PEP 446 - Inheritable file descriptors](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0446/)?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Things that didn't work\r\n\r\n\r\n### Nose --attr\r\n\r\nI tried using the nosetests --attr feature to run the tests separately. I put the following in setup.cfg\r\n\r\n    [nosetests]\r\n    atttr=!run_alone\r\n\r\nThen I added a tox section thst did this\r\n\r\n    nosetests --attr=run_alone\r\n\r\nHowever, the command line --attr would not override the config file --attr, so the special tox section wound up runing all the tests, and failing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Nose --with-isolation\r\n\r\nThe nosetests --with-isolation flag did not help.\r\n\r\n\r\n### unittest.skipIf\r\n\r\nI tried decorating the problematic tests with the unittest.skipIf\r\ndecorator.\r\n\r\n    @unittest.skipIf(is_windows() and sys.version_info < (3, 4),\r\n                     \"Fails on Windows with Python < 3.4 when run with other\"\r\n                     \" tests.\")\r\n\r\nThe idea is, skip the tests in the main test run, on affected platforms. Then, only on those platforms, come back in later and run the tests separately.\r\n\r\nI added a new stanza to tox.ini, to run the tests separately on the affected platforms.\r\n\r\n    nosetests --no-skip\r\n\r\nI ran in to a bug in the nosetests skip plugin. It would report the test as having been run, but it would not actually run the test. So, when run with `--no-skip`, the following test would be reported as having run and passed!\r\n\r\n    @unittest.skip(\"This passes o_o\")\r\n    def test_should_fail(self):\r\n        assert 0\r\n\r\nThis bug has been reported here: [--no-skip broken with Python 2.7](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/issues/512)\r\n\r\n\r\n### py.test\r\n\r\nCode for this attempt can be seen at christianmlong/flake8@6dbb843f\r\n\r\nI tried using py.test, and its `@pytest.mark.xfail` decorator. I added some separate stanzas in tox, and useing the pytest `--runxfail` option to run the tests separately. This allows us to run all the tests together, on platforms that allow it. On platforms that don't allow us to run the tests all together, this still runs all the tests, but in two separate steps.\r\n\r\nThis is the same solution as the nosetests `--no-skip` solution I described above, but `--runxfail` does not have the same bug as `--no-skip`.\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage that all tests are discoverable by default, outside of tox. However, nose does not recognize the `pytest.mark.xfail` decorator. So, if a user runs nosetests, it still tries to run the problematic tests together with the rest of the test suite, causing them to fail.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nMove the problematic tests to _test_warnings.py, so nose.collector will not find them. Set up a separate section in tox.ini that runs this:\r\n\r\n    nosetests flake8.tests._test_warnings\r\n\r\nThis allows all tests to pass on all platforms, when run through tox. However, it means that, even on unaffected platforms, the problematic tests are not discovered and run outside of tox (if the user just runs nosetests manually, for example).\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812776092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4547473636,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU0NzQ3MzYzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547473636","actor":{"login":"christianmlong","id":3912048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3912048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong","html_url":"https://github.com/christianmlong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T01:56:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4547473637,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NDc0NzM2Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547473637","actor":{"login":"christianmlong","id":3912048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTIwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3912048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong","html_url":"https://github.com/christianmlong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianmlong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T01:56:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812776095","html_url":"https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/87#issuecomment-812776095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/87","id":812776095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjc3NjA5NQ==","user":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","
