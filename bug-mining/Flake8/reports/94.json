I don't think this is a correct behaviour, as in my opinion, it supposed to record a snapshot of current code state. And in any case, why would I worry what flake8 issues were previously recorded? That change to append mode actually has broken our CI. We were using --output-file option to produce a snapshot of commit and then checking if there were any errors, but now it always reports the same error, no matter what we commit afterwards.\n\nIt is easy to fix on our side, just remove that produced file before each run, but in general, I don't think it is a right behaviour. I think by default it should overwrite, unless an option (for e.g. `-a` if it is not used) is provided not to.","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/156/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
