What appears to happen (to me) is that something is changing the version of Flake8 you are relying on but not forcing it to change its dependencies as well. What that means is, something is forcibly downgrading Flake8 but not it's dependencies so when setuptools starts scanning entry points, it notes this version conflict and raises the exception, even if not using Flake8.\n\nThis is *not* a bug in Flake8 nor do I consider it one in setuptools. You should figure out what's forcing the downgrade of flake8 though.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812784473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4547504430,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU0NzUwNDQzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547504430","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:39:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4547504433,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NDc1MDQ0MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547504433","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:39:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812784528","html_url":"https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/195#issuecomment-812784528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/195","id":812784528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjc4NDUyOA==","user":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:39:29Z","

In conda_requirements, you have `flake8` with no bound. The same is true for your `requirements.txt`. The difference that seems to agree with your problem is that you have `pyflakes` specified in your requirements.txt. So while conda installs: [flake8 2.5.1](https://travis-ci.org/YeoLab/outrigger/jobs/175885323#L349) you also manage to get too new a version of [pyflakes](https://travis-ci.org/YeoLab/outrigger/jobs/175885323#L395).\n\nI don't know why this happens or how flake8 runs when it runs, but you've found a very interesting problem.
