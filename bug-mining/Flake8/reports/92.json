GitLab by @PeterJCLaw on May 5, 2020, 10:52\n\nIf you have a `setup.cfg` which looks like this:\n``` ini\n[flake8:local-plugins]\nextension =\n    T = python_logging:logging_check\n    T = wrap_testdata:wrap_testdata_check\n```\n\nThen when `flake8` runs it will ignore the `python_logging:logging_check` entry and only load `wrap_testdata:wrap_testdata_check`.\n\nEven if this is a limitation of the `ini` format, I'm guessing that in most other cases this wouldn't impact the user -- they're much more likely to notice errors that they thought they'd silenced which are now loud than errors not appearing (as this case creates).","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
