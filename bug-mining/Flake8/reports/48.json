Keeps me in check when I'm changing too many things at once. I installed `flake8` using `pip` in this [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/YeoLab/outrigger/jobs/175885323), using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `flake8` is one of the requirements.\n\nOddly enough, all my tests run and my `make lint`, where the `lint` directive is below script passes, but ...\n\n```make\nlint:\n\tflake8 --exclude outrigger/external,doc outrigger\n```\n\nI also have a sanity check test to run my program on the command line and this is where the error occurs:\n\n```\n$ make lint\nflake8 --exclude outrigger/external,doc outrigger\nThe command \"make lint\" exited with 0.\n$ make arabdopsis\nrm -rf *outrigger_output\noutrigger index \\\n\t\t--sj-out-tab outrigger/tests/data/arabdopsis/unprocessed/rna.chr4.subset.SJ.out.tab \\\n\t\t--gtf outrigger/tests/data/arabdopsis/unprocessed/Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.31.chr4.subset.gtf \\\n\t\t--min-reads 1 --n-jobs -1 \\\n\t\t--output arabdopsis_outrigger_output\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/bin/outrigger\", line 6, in <module>\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\n  File \"/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-27.2.0-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 2985, in <module>\n  File \"/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-27.2.0-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 2971, in _call_aside\n  File \"/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-27.2.0-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 2998, in _initialize_master_working_set\n  File \"/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-27.2.0-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 662, in _build_master\n  File \"/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-27.2.0-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 675, in _build_from_requirements\n  File \"/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-27.2.0-py2.7.egg/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 859, in resolve\npkg_resources.ContextualVersionConflict: (pyflakes 1.3.0 (/home/travis/miniconda/envs/testenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('pyflakes<1.1,>=0.8.1'), set(['flake8']))\nmake: *** [arabdopsis] Error 1\n```\n\nI don't expect any `flake8` error when I run this code because `flake8` isn't imported anywhere in my program. I only use it on the command line for lint checking. Do you think something could be happening because `make lint` occurs right before `make arabdopsis`?\n\nThank you!\nOlga","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
