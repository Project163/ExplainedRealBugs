GitLab by @twolfson on Nov 19, 2015, 23:28\n\nI am a maintainer of [flake8-quotes][], a `flake8` linter that verifies quotes are being kept consistent in a repo. Due to the nature of our lint, it's much easier for us to work with tokens than an AST. We have been using a workaround which re-reads the file directly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we received a report of this not working with `stdin` on Python 3.4 due to `stdin` already being consumed and closed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zheller/flake8-quotes/issues/12\r\n\r\nInstead of putting a hack on top of another hack (i.e. converting the AST back to Python and then convert it into tokens), we were wondering if there was a better solution (e.g. allowing linters to accept lines or tokens directly).\r\n\r\nAs a side note, we looked around the `pep8` repo a bit and found an integration with `function` that accepts lines directly. However, it's undocumented so we are hesitant to use it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pep8/blob/4dc42d842274ba27d2724e76eb83ff69e7db226f/pep8.py#L1334-L1342\r\n\r\n[flake8-quotes]:

GitLab by @xZise on Jun 1, 2016, 11:44\n\nAs mentioned in #88, it forces a space in the output after the fourth character. So if the message is `BUG>X<-- Space forced there`, the actual output is `…:1:2: BUG> <-- Space forced there`. Now you suggested a sample code, but to be honest I'm not exactly sure how to properly trim it down, so here is the class:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Bug141(object):\r\n\r\n    version = '1'\r\n    name = 'flake8-bug141'\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, tree, filename):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def run(self):\r\n        yield 1, 1, \"BUG>X<-- Space forced there\", type(self)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also affects how `--ignore` works:\r\n* `--ignore \"BUG> \"` works, which might be because it is trimming the text, in which case it is not related to the issue above\r\n* `--ignore \"BUG> <\"` works not\r\n* `--ignore \"BUG>_<\"` works not too\r\n\r\nApart from that, it should be documented how the error code should be formatted. Some assume that it's always `[A-Z]\\d\\d\\d` while others assume it's always `[A-Z0-9]{4}` while it could be actually anything apart from a space (to separate code from the message).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
