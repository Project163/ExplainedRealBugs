My example `setup.cfg` file looks like so:\n\n```\n[flake8]\nmax-line-length = 90\nverbose = 2\n```\n\nWhen I run `flake8`, no output is produced unless I force a violation.\n\nI installed Flake8 from pip (`pip install flake8`) in a virtualenv. Here is the output of `flake8 --bug-report`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    {\n      \"dependency\": \"setuptools\",\n      \"version\": \"38.5.1\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"platform\": {\n    \"python_implementation\": \"CPython\",\n    \"python_version\": \"3.6.4\",\n    \"system\": \"Darwin\"\n  },\n  \"plugins\": [\n    {\n      \"is_local\": false,\n      \"plugin\": \"mccabe\",\n      \"version\": \"0.6.1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"is_local\": false,\n      \"plugin\": \"pycodestyle\",\n      \"version\": \"2.3.1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"is_local\": false,\n      \"plugin\": \"pyflakes\",\n      \"version\": \"1.6.0\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"version\": \"3.5.0\"\n}\n```","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
