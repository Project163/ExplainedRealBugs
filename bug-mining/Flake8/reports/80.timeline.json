Though I think this is a bug with lib2to3 (and then subsequently the `flake8-strict` plugin).  Let me see if I can write you a small script to figure out what the bad apple is.  I wonder if there's a way to make `flake8` expose this plugin failure directly too :thinking: \n\nUsually something like this would show you the specific file it is failing on, but I'm still not seeing that myself:\n\n```\ngit ls-files -- '*.py' | xargs -P4 --replace bash -c 'flake8 -j1 {} || echo {}'\n```\n\nIt could also be something in a virtualenv that's not excluded?\n\n---\n\nEither way here's a minimal reproduction:\n\n(using python<3.7, flake8-strict installed)\n\n```python\nprint(\n    _ for _ in range(5),\n)\n```\n\n```console\n$ flake8 -j2 t.py\nException in thread
