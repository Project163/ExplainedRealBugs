I attempted to follow the documentation on how to create a formatting plugin, but no matter what I do, it just seems to show this error when I run `flake8`:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/cnejame/homebrew/bin/flake8\", line 11, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('flake8', 'console_scripts', 'flake8')()\n  File \"/Users/cnejame/homebrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flake8/main/cli.py\", line 16, in main\n    app.run(argv)\n  File \"/Users/cnejame/homebrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flake8/main/application.py\", line 316, in run\n    self._run(argv)\n  File \"/Users/cnejame/homebrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flake8/main/application.py\", line 299, in _run\n    self.initialize(argv)\n  File \"/Users/cnejame/homebrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flake8/main/application.py\", line 293, in initialize\n    self.make_notifier()\n  File \"/Users/cnejame/homebrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flake8/main/application.py\", line 201, in make_notifier\n    self.listener_trie = self.listening_plugins.build_notifier()\n  File \"/Users/cnejame/homebrew/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flake8/plugins/manager.py\", line 428, in build_notifier\n    notifier_trie.register_listener(name, self.manager[name])\nTypeError: 'PluginManager' object has no attribute '__getitem__'\n```\n\nI'm mostly guessing at how to approach this, so I could be approaching this the wrong way, but here's [a link to the extension](https://github.com/truveris/flake8-truveris) I have working. To create the formatter, I just changed the `entry_points` arg in my `setup.py` file to this:\n\n```python\n    entry_points={\n        \"flake8.extension\": [\n            'T = flake8_truveris:CheckTruveris',\n        ],\n        \"flake8.listen\": [\n            'T = flake8_truveris:FormatTruveris',\n        ],\n    },\n```\n\nand just made that `FormatTruveris` class in the `flake8_truveris/__init__.py` file. The class looked like this:\n\n```python\nclass FormatTruveris(base.BaseFormatter):\n\n    def format(self, error):\n        return 'Example formatter: {0!r}'.format(error)\n```\n\nas I just wanted to see where this got me.","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
