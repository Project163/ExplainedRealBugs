Now on 3.2.0 (probably 3.1.0 too) it is not and users have to use `--enable-extensions C`, afaict. I noticed this whilst upgrading my tests ([github pr](https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-comprehensions/pull/31)).\n\n*If this is a bug report, please explain with examples (and example code) what you expected to happen and what actually happened.*\n\nThe plugin should still be picked up automatically. From reading the changelog, #239 was the only thing that changed this behaviour in 3.1.0, but it should have only affected plugins with `off_by_default = True`, which `flake8-comprehensions` does not have.","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
