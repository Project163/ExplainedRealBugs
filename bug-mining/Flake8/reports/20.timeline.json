0.4.1)\n- [ ] flake8-putty (see: https://github.com/jayvdb/flake8-putty/issues/15, https://github.com/jayvdb/flake8-putty/issues/14)\n- [x] flake8-copyright (see:

[x] flake8-mock (optional parameter of `builtins` that is unused, see #151, fixed by 2d3e277)\n- [x] flake8-debugger (optional parameter of `builtins` that is unused, see #151, fixed by 2d3e277)\n-
