The reason is that the arguments are only partially digested by flake8, and then passed as a kwarg ``{'ignore': 'E225,E226,W293'}`` (from ``self.options_dict``) to pep8's ``get_style_guide``.  The latter must expect that the ``ignore=`` argument is fully digested as a tuple ``ignore=('E225', 'E226', 'W293')`` as it does not digest further and simply pulls this apart [``options.ignore = ... tuple(options.ignore)``](https://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/blob/dcfdfda78527392433a78d8ed68b6d5a78cdf6c2/pep8.py#L1807) to obtain the useless set of ignores ``('E', '2', '2', '5', ',',...``.  (This code is the same in pre 1.6.0 versions and 1.6.2).\r\n\r\nI believe this is just another incarnation of issue #4 for which the fix was specific to a single ``exclude`` option rather than addressing the general issue.\r\n\r\nPlease either completely digest the options, or somehow let pep8 do it instead (not sure how though).  Actually, in retrospect, why are options like ignore specified in the ``[flake8]`` section rather than simply in the ``[pep8]`` section where both pep8 and flake8 could be configured together (for the pep8 related stuff)?","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/83/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/83/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
