GitLab by @dopplershift on Nov 21, 2016, 15:25\n\nCurrently if you hit a permission problem on a file (or at least that's my best guess of what went wrong on AppVeyor), you get:\r\n\r\n```pytb\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Miniconda\\envs\\_test\\Scripts\\flake8-script.py\", line 11, in <module>\r\n    load_entry_point('flake8==3.2.1',

'filename'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the combination of setting `FileChecker.display_name` to `self.processor.filename` at https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/blob/master/src/flake8/checker.py#L412 and the fact that `FileChecker._make_processor()` returns `None` in the error path at https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/blob/master/src/flake8/checker.py#L412.\r\n\r\nNot the cause of my problem, but it keeps me from ever seeing the error message from `IOError`.","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
