It is about enabling default-disabled codes without having to explicitly list all other codes.\n\n*That* seems like it is possible.

don't believe it would enable default-disabled codes from plugins.\n\n* I have an `ignore` list for `flake8` core and various plugins.\n* I have a plugin that leaves some codes disabled by default (I don't know enough about `flake8` to say whether it is a bug, but it appears to be both intentional, common practice and useful).\n* I want to keep my `ignore` list and add some or all of the disabled codes.\n* using `select` requires listing everything, which is awkward both now and for maintenance.\n* using `ignore=` enables absolutely everything but (possibly?) doesn't help with my plugin's default-disabled codes.\n\nI think the original reporter probably had the same scenario in mind, just misunderstood what was wrong with a particular code. I've encountered similar with multiple plugins which documented their off-by-default codes and suggested using `select` to enable them.\n\n#365 possibly covers this use-case. It is hard to tell from the description though. If the intention is to literally add to the `select` list, I don't think it will help for the reasons above.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812800953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
