I'd like to define my lint rules at the top level in a `setup.cfg` and have individual `tox.ini` files for each subproject.\n\nCurrently the existence of `tox.ini`, without a `flake8` header, causes `flake8` to consider itself 'configured' with just the defaults, and the search for the config stops. I would expect it to find the flake8 config in my `setup.cfg` instead.\n\nIt's also non-deterministic based upon the current directory when `flake8` is run.\n\nMy current workaround is to always invoke `flake8` with `--config` pointed to the absolute path of the config file, which isn't ideal.\n\n*If this is a bug report, please explain with examples (and example code) what you expected to happen and what actually happened.*\n\n```\n$ tree .\n.\n├── setup.cfg\n└── subproj\n    ├── test.py\n    └── tox.ini\n\n1 directory, 3 files\n$ cat setup.cfg\n[flake8]\nmax-line-length = 120\n$ cat subproj/tox.ini\n[tox]\nsomething = something\n$ cat subproj/test.py\n# this line is longer than 80 chars but less than 120 chars and so should be allowed, but it isn't\n$ flake8  # passes\n$ flake8 subproj/test.py  # fails\nsubproj/test.py:1:80: E501 line too long (98 > 79 characters)\n$ cd subproj\n$ flake8  # fails\n./test.py:1:80: E501 line too long (98 > 79 characters)\n```","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
