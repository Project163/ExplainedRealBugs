However, I recently used `flake8 --install-hook=git` to install the flake8 pre-commit hook. It seems that the flake8 application which is run via the hook does not pick up these settings:\n\n```\n$ git commit\n/var/folders/wd/xwtcqngj7kz6sc8ff150dslr0000gn/T/tmp2l2N6g/[FILENAME_ELIDED].py:85:80: E501 line too long (82 > 79 characters)\n[...]\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is intended behavior or a bug. In either case, I'd appreciate some guidance on how to alter the hook to handle simple options.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nP.S. I tried duplicating my `.flake8` file into the other possible configuration filenames (`tox.ini` and `setup.cfg`) and did not observe any change in behavior.\n\n====\n\n- Python 2.7.10\n- Installed via pip 8.1.2\n- Setuptools version 24.0.3\n- Flake8 3.0.2 (mccabe: 0.5.1, pyflakes: 1.2.3, pycodestyle: 2.0.0) CPython 2.7.10 on Darwin`","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/155/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
