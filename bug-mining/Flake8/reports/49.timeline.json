configurations for flake8.\r\nWith version 4 of flake8 both file were taken into account.\r\n\r\nBut with the upgrade to version 5, flake8 seems to ignore the `.flake8`-file. I went trough the changelog and the list of (un-)resolved issues, but could not find any explanation. #199 inspired me to take a look into its implementation:\r\n`flake8/src/flake8/options/config.py`:\r\n```python\r\n33    for candidate in (\"setup.cfg\", \"tox.ini\", \".flake8\"):\r\n34        ...\r\n41        # only consider it a config if it contains flake8 sections\r\n42        if \"flake8\" in cfg or \"flake8:local-plugins\" in cfg:\r\n43             return cfg_path\r\n```\r\n\r\nApparently, only the first configuration file in the list `\"setup.cfg\", \"tox.ini\", \".flake8\"` is taken.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this behaviour is desired or not and may be confirmed?\r\n\r\nI think for my project I will take this issue as an occasion to merge the different configuration files.\r\n\r\n#### sample code\r\nMWE:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── .flake8\r\n├── setup.cfg\r\n└── t.py\r\n```\r\n`.flake8`:\r\n```ini\r\n[flake8]\r\nmax-line-length = 88\r\n```\r\n`setup.cfg`:\r\n```ini\r\n[flake8]\r\nextend-ignore = E203\r\n```\r\n`t.py`\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very long text\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### commands ran\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ flake8 t.py\r\nt.py:1:80: E501 line too long (83 > 79 characters)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1660/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
