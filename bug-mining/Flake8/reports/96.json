It would be ideal if I could just add a `# noqa` to squelch this flake8 bug.\r\n\r\nI hope the bug will be fixed, but also hope that this will serve as an example that could provide impetus for the authors to give users the option to allow `# noqa` to override any errors.  It is in bad taste to take power away from users because \"the authors know best\".  Sensible defaults are fine, but to prevent overriding them is not.\r\n\r\nI am familiar with https://github.com/spookylukey/flake8-respect-noqa, by the way, but this should be an option built into flake8.","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
