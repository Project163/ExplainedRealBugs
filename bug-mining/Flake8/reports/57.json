When I run flake8, I don't get the flake8-mutable M511 warnings that indicate a mutable default argument. I assume that this check is disabled by default. To enable it, I have to explicitly add it to a `select` parameter. I'm not happy with that because I don't want to maintain a whitelist of checks, I want to simply enable them all.\n\nEnabling *all* flake8 warnings is currently something that is not pretty. I don't know which groups/letters are supported at the moment and if items are added later I want to them to work out-of-the-box.\nThis is how I currently enable all warnings in my .flake8 file:\n```\nselect=A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n```\n\nI think the following might be prettier:\n```\nselect=*\n```","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
