GitLab by @sigmavirus24 on Nov 19, 2016, 06:25\n\n_Merges bug/266 -> master_\n\nBy default, when discovering files for users, we use the filename\npatterns to determine whether or not we should check that file. However,\nwhen a user provides the path to a file, we should instead skip checking\nthe name against the filename patterns provided.\n\nFor example, in Flake8 2.6 this worked:\n\n    $ flake8 bin/script.py\n    $ flake8 bin/script\n\nBut prior to this commit only\n\n    $ flake8 bin/script.py\n\nworks. This commit will skip the filename pattern check if the user\nprovides the path explicitly which allows\n\n    $ flake8 bin/script\n\nto work again as expected.\n\nCloses #266","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
