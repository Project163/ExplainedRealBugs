GitLab by @xZise on Jul 19, 2016, 06:20\n\nThe current version of Flake8 (3.0.0b2) doesn't support plugin defined parameters. In `Application.__init__` you parse the arguments to get preliminary options for the logger. But if the parser detects unknown parameters it'll stop the program there.\r\n\r\nTo replicate install a plugin which adds parameters (for example `flake8-quotes`) and use their parameter (e.g. `--inline-quotes`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ flake8 --inline-quotes=\\\" setup.py \r\nUsage: flake8 [options] file file ...\r\n\r\nflake8: error: no such option: --inline-quotes\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't really know how to avoid this with `optparse` without changing some private method or reimplementing a lot of stuff. `argparse` has a method [`ArgumentParser.parse_known_args`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/argparse.html#partial-parsing) which would allow that. But to implement that into `optparse` would probably require to manually replicate `OptionParser._process_args` to ignore bad arguments. This could probably work as you don't parse any positional parameters as long as the user doesn't combine multiple short options into one option. What I mean is if there is a command like `ls -la` which is shorthand for `ls -l -a`, because if one of them (in the `-la`) is not recognized it'll abort parsing that block even.\r\n\r\nAnd actually
