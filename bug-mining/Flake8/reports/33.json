And I'd like to provide a consistency option which automatically detects the `__future__` imports which are required on certain conditions:\r\n\r\n* For example if most files import `unicode_literals`, I want to make it a necessary import on all files checked\r\n* Or if most modules which divide stuff are also using `division` , I want to make it a necessary import too on other modules using divisions.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment I only get one file after another and can't check previous files later. Or is the recommended strategy to cache something separately in the module and assume that the module gets only created at the start of the run and is only persistent for one run?","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
