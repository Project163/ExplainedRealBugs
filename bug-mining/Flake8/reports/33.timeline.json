To be honest, I think this might be faster (for processing) if it was a separate tool. `__future__` imports are always the first things in a module (after comments, newlines, and docstrings) which means you can read lines until you find the first non (docstring|comment|newline) line. You'll still need a way of determining which imports to enforce based on whatever metrics/data you want/have. That said, your second point seems interesting:\r\n\r\n> Or if most modules which divide stuff are also using division , I want to make it a necessary import too on other modules using divisions.\r\n\r\nThis seems like it will not be very efficient. Your best bet will either be a full file search for `/` (which may not be what you actually care about for `from __future__ import division` because of custom magic methods) *or* you'll have to walk the entire parsed AST looking for two \"number\"-like types using division before enforcing that.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that it makes sense to enforce an import like that only in modules with division actually happening, that might be more intensive than you're expecting at this point. Further, you could apply the same approach to string literals and `unicode_literals`. If the only strings in your module are docstrings, `unicode_literals` isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nThat said, flake8 (really, pyflakes) do not provide access to their parsed copies of the AST. While parsing it isn't the slow part (traversing it can be), you can imagine what happens when several flake8 plugins are all parsing the AST some just to search for the usage of a single operator or for the use of a string literal.\r\n\r\nFinally, while I've humored this here, this is all much better suited for a mailing list discussion at the [code-quality](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality) mailing list.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812777291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4547481023,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU0NzQ4MTAyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547481023","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:05:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4547481024,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NDc0ODEwMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547481024","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:05:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4547481064,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDU0NzQ4MTA2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547481064","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:05:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"
