GitLab by @xZise on Jul 10, 2016, 14:52\n\nUsing Flake8 3.0.0b2 I get a PicklingError when I try to it with a plugin ([flake8-string-format](https://github.com/xZise/flake8-string-format)) installed via `python setup.py develop`. When I use `pip install flake8-string-format` it won't cause the error. I tested it on Python version 2.7.10 and 3.5.2. Both show similar results:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ flake8 flake8_string_format.py \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/queues.py\", line 268, in _feed\r\n    send(obj)\r\nPicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ flake8 flake8_string_format.py \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/xzise/.pyenv/versions/3.5.1/lib/python3.5/multiprocessing/queues.py\", line 241, in _feed\r\n    obj = ForkingPickler.dumps(obj)\r\n  File \"/home/xzise/.pyenv/versions/3.5.1/lib/python3.5/multiprocessing/reduction.py\", line 50, in dumps\r\n    cls(buf, protocol).dump(obj)\r\nAttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'compile.<locals>.marker_fn'\r\n```\r\n\r\nUninstalling the plugin does not fix the error, but reinstalling `flake8` (obviously without the plugin). I'm also not sure what part of the plugin is actually causing that error. And maybe this is related to #164, but I'm not using `python setup.py flake8`.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce you can use the following commands:\r\n```\r\n$ cd …into a directory of your choosing…\r\n$ wget https://github.com/xZise/flake8-string-format/archive/0.2.2.zip\r\n$ unzip 0.2.2.zip \r\n$ cd flake8-string-format-0.2.2/\r\n$ virtualenv failure\r\n$ source failure/bin/activate\r\n$ pip install
