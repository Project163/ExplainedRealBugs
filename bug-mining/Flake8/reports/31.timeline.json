found that flake8 doesn't consider comments as blank lines,\r\nIn my case I had a single method and 2 TODO on top of my method\r\n```\r\n1. import requests\r\n2. \r\n3. # TODO: 1\r\n4. # TODO: 2\r\n5.

error E302)\r\n\r\nThe solution is to add a new line (the missing one) on line 2, with this rule will pass.\r\n```\r\n1. import requests\r\n2. \r\n3. \r\n4. # TODO: 1\r\n5. # TODO: 2\r\n6. def
