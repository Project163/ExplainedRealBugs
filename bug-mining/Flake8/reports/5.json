This is too granular - I would like to ignore a specific error type per file or line. For example, pylint supports this typo of ignore with `# pylint: disable=X0123`. Would love to see this same functionality in flake8.","closed_by":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
