After speaking around with fellow developers, they all agreed that that output file should be overwritten, but maybe it is just in my environment.

I've already added a step in my CI to remove the output file before making a new one, and I'm not going to agree that flake8 is a logging tool how your codebase evolved (VCS is doing that).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812779578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4547497074,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU0NzQ5NzA3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547497074","actor":{"login":"Rapolas","id":1203951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas","html_url":"https://github.com/Rapolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:27:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4547497075,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NDc0OTcwNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547497075","actor":{"login":"Rapolas","id":1203951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDM5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas","html_url":"https://github.com/Rapolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rapolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:27:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812779583","html_url":"https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/156#issuecomment-812779583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/156","id":812779583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjc3OTU4Mw==","user":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:27:36Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T02:27:36Z","body":"In

Currently (both 2.x and 3.0a) finalize the configuration at the start, and then apply that same configuration to every file that gets linted. I think it makes more sense to instead scan for configuration at each directory as we go along.\n\nSo starting at the project root (or cwd):\n1. Load configuation in directory (overriding any existing config)\n2. Lint files in directory\n3. Move to included subdirectory\n4. Go back to 1\n\nThis allows you to have a global project configuration, but also allow sub-directories within that project to set their own
