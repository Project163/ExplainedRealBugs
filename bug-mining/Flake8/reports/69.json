I would also like to see the results on the screen, so I run with `--tee`. Unfortunately in this case, xml is printed to the screen. Ideally I would be able to control the formatter used for screen output so that it is human readable.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/249/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
