GitLab by @sigmavirus24 on Nov 29, 2016, 08:03\n\nThere's little we can do for the Jenkins builds on our end. Ideally the new pipeline workflow that's being worked on would simplify this for us. As it is, the GitLab plugin is skeletal and doesn't allow us to handle merge requests and pushes in the same job definition. I've raised issues about this in the past, but it's been a fruitless endeavor. It's also partially GitLab's fault that some things are harder for them to implement.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812789741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4547507403,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDU0NzUwNzQwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547507403","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:43:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4547507406,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ1NDc1MDc0MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/events/4547507406","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:43:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/comments/812789791","html_url":"https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/209#issuecomment-812789791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PyCQA/flake8/issues/209","id":812789791,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMjc4OTc5MQ==","user":{"login":"asottile","id":1810591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile","html_url":"https://github.com/asottile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asottile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-03T02:43:54Z
