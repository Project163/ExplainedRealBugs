But I found a small mistake in the function `get(int x, int y)`  when I used `JoinedArray`.\r\n```\r\nif ((y<0)||(y>=sliceCount())) {\r\n\tthrow new IndexOutOfBoundsException(ErrorMessages.invalidIndex(this, x,y));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe code above has some problem.\r\n`y` should be the second dimension of an array. But `sliceCount()` will return the size of the first dimension of this array.This comparison is easier throwing a exception when  the second dimension larger than the first dimension.","closed_by":{"login":"hopeful0","id":13890191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODkwMTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13890191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0","html_url":"https://github.com/hopeful0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hopeful0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikera/vectorz/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mikera/vectorz/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
