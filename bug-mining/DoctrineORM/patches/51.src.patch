+When using the ``EntityManager#getReference()`` method, you need to be aware
+of a few peculiarities.
+
+At the best case, the ORM can avoid querying the database at all. But, that
+also means that this method will not throw an exception when an invalid value
+for the ``$identifier`` parameter is passed. ``$identifier`` values are
+not checked and there is no guarantee that the requested entity instance even
+exists – the method will still return a proxy object.
+
+Its only when the proxy has to be fully initialized or associations cannot
+be written to the database that invalid ``$identifier`` values may lead to
+exceptions.
+
+The ``EntityManager#getReference()`` is mostly useful when you only
+need a reference to some entity to make an association, like in the example
+above. In that case, it can save you from loading data from the database
+that you don't need. But remember – as soon as you read any property values
+besides those making up the ID, a database request will be made to initialize
+all fields.
