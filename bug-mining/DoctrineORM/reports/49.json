Omitting it makes Doctrine auto-generate a hash-based name, which is consistent with the indexes generated for foreign keys and is therefore good IMO.\n\nIf this is not just a side effect and omitting the `name` parameter is actually supported, it would be nice to update the docs to reflect this.\n","closed_by":{"login":"SenseException","id":859964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTk2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/859964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException","html_url":"https://github.com/SenseException","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SenseException/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/4283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/4283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
