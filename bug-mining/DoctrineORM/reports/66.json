This syntax is invalid in SQL Server.\n\n\n#### Expected behavior\n\n<!-- What was the expected (correct) behavior? -->\n\nUntil v3.3.1 the schema and table names were quoted individually: `schema.[table]`. This is valid SQL Server syntax.\n\n\n#### How to reproduce\n\n<!--\nProvide a failing Unit or Functional Test - you can submit one in a Pull\nRequest separately, referencing this bug report. And if you feel like it, why\nnot fix the bug while you're at it?\nIf that is too difficult, provide a link to a minimal repository containing an\napplication that reproduces the bug.\nIf the bug is simple, you may provide a code snippet instead, or even a list of\nsteps.\n-->\n\nCreate an entity using a quoted table name.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\n\nnamespace App\\Entity;\n\nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM;\n\nuse function uuid_create;\n\n#[ORM\\Entity]\n#[ORM\\Table(name: '`file`', schema: 'myschema')]\nclass File\n{\n    #[ORM\\Id]\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: 'guid', unique: true, nullable: false)]\n    private string $id;\n\n...\n\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"greg0ire","id":657779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/657779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire","html_url":"https://github.com/greg0ire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/12041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/12041/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
