using strict typing in PHP 7.0.4: `declare (strict_types = 1);` , I noticed that an error is returned for userland code like\n\n``` php\npublic function removeUser(User $user) : bool\n{\n    return $this->users->removeElement($user);\n}\n\n```\n\nThis results in an error message like:\n\n```\nReturn value of Project\\Entity::removeUser() must be of the type boolean, object returned\n```\n\nI had a look at all `removeElement()` functions used in the project and I suspect [this section](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/b055d78ea19835fab563dfc234d4804a9d04966a/lib/Doctrine/ORM/PersistentCollection.php#L378-L380)\n\nWill try to come up with a test but already wanted to register this issue so I will not forget it. \n\n**UPDATE**\nIt appears that this can be tested in [ExtraLazyCollectionTest::testRemoveElementManyToMany()](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/b055d78ea19835fab563dfc234d4804a9d04966a/tests/Doctrine/Tests/ORM/Functional/ExtraLazyCollectionTest.php#L639):\n\n``` php\n        $result = $user->groups->removeElement($group);\n        $this->assertTrue($result);\n```\n\nHowever, this made me wonder, why does [this part](https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/b055d78ea19835fab563dfc234d4804a9d04966a/lib/Doctrine/ORM/PersistentCollection.php#L382) returns `NULL` while the [Collection interface indicates](https://github.com/doctrine/collections/blob/392b8dd9e04c073e832fcda99270ec5a8f5e30cd/lib/Doctrine/Common/Collections/Collection.php#L98) it should return a `boolean`? Is returning the element/null on purpose?\n","closed_by":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
