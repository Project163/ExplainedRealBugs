The example speaks for itself.\n\nAdd `TARGET_PROPERTY` to  `#[Index]` attribute.\n\n#### Why\n\nMaking re-usable traits.\n\nNow:\n```php\ntrait SomeCommonFields\n{\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: 'integer')]\n    public int $shared;\n}\n\n#[ORM\\Entity]\n#[ORM\\Index('shared_field_idx', fields: ['shared'])] // we don't even know the fields, we have to look into the trait to find the names of the fields..\nclass A\n{\n    use SomeCommonFields;\n}\n\n#[ORM\\Entity]\n#[ORM\\Index('shared_field_idx', fields: ['shared'])]\nclass B\n{\n    use SomeCommonFields;\n}\n```\n\nBetter:\n```php\ntrait SomeCommonFields\n{\n    #[ORM\\Index]\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: 'integer')]\n    public int $shared;\n}\n\n#[ORM\\Entity]\nclass A\n{\n    use SomeCommonFields;\n}\n\n#[ORM\\Entity]\nclass B\n{\n    use SomeCommonFields;\n}\n```\n\n#### How\n\nSame way `unique` already works on `Column` today, it could just be included in `Column`, or like the example, make the `Index` attribute work on properties too. Auto generate some index name and grab the property it's attached to as the \"fields\".","closed_by":{"login":"greg0ire","id":657779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/657779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire","html_url":"https://github.com/greg0ire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/11982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/11982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
