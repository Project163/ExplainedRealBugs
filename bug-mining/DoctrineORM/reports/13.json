More specifically this line:\n\n``` php\n// Doctrine/ORM/Persisters/Entity/BasicEntityPersister.php:346\n$value = $this->conn->fetchColumn($sql, array_values($flatId));\n```\n\nThe third and fourth parameters of `fetchColumn` should be `0` and the type(s) of the `$flatId` field(s). But nothing is sent. In my situation, my primary key is a custom type `uuid_binary`. Then down the line when you get to `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Connection::executeQuery` and the statement is being prepared, since there is no types involved in the `$types` parameter, the binding actually never happens!\n\n``` php\n// Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/PDOStatement.php:825\n$stmt = $this->_conn->prepare($query);\nif ($types) {\n    $this->_bindTypedValues($stmt, $params, $types);\n    $stmt->execute();\n} else {\n    $stmt->execute($params);\n}\n```\n\nWhich means that the versioning query...\n\n``` sql\nSELECT version FROM tablename WHERE primarykey = ?\n```\n\n... doesn't ever receive any value for the `primarykey` placeholder and the request ultimately fails and returns `false`. Doctrine then takes this `false` and assigns it to the `@Version` field of the entity in `Doctrine\\ORM\\Persisters\\Entity\\BasicEntityPersister::assignDefaultVersionValue`, which then translates to `0`.\n\n``` php\n// Doctrine/ORM/Persisters/Entity/BasicEntityPersister.php:317\nprotected function assignDefaultVersionValue($entity, array $id)\n{\n    $value = $this->fetchVersionValue($this->class, $id);\n    $this->class->setFieldValue($entity, $this->class->versionField, $value);\n}\n```\n\nSo it seems like this scenario is entirely missing.\n","closed_by":{"login":"lcobucci","id":201963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/201963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci","html_url":"https://github.com/lcobucci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcobucci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
