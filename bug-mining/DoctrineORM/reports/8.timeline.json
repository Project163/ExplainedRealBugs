SimpleArrayType and JsonArrayType convert the value `null` to an empty array, which fails the null check that is used to prevent overwrite (in https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/v2.5.4/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Internal/Hydration/SimpleObjectHydrator.php#L134).\nFixes issue #5989 \n\nIt could be debated that the issue is actually with the types that convert null to something else (especially since ArrayType actually returns null when the value is null). But changing them would be a BC break so I think it is a separate issue. Also, there is no way to know how custom types will convert null values, so it seems like a reasonable approach to check for null before the conversion since it's quite a serious bug to overwrite data in the hydrator.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/6004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/6004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/245425763","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/5989#issuecomment-245425763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5989","id":245425763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTQyNTc2Mw==","user":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-07T21:30:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-07T21:30:33Z","body":"The

have an entity named A, which is extended on multi table inheritance by B and C.\r\n\r\nBoth have a property called $user, which is a simple string on B and a simple_array on C.\r\n\r\nIf I load the

This is because AbstractHydrator is setting first non null value from all the joined tabled after translating it into php. Null is converted into array in SimpleArrayType convertToPHPValue function.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn easy solution could be to check for the value to be null BEFORE assigning it, as for #5989

Bug Report\r\n\r\n|    Q        |   A\r\n|------------ | ------\r\n| BC Break    | no\r\n| Version     | 2.6.3\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\n`SimpleObjectHydrator` produces a type error when two classes with the same parent class both define a property with the same name and different types.\r\n\r\nI think this may be related to issue #5989.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nWhen two classes inherit from the same parent using `SINGLE_TABLE` inheritance, and both classes define the same property with different types, `SimpleObjectHydrator` produce a type error if one of the properties is of type `simple_array`.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate an abstract class with two child classes:\r\n```php\r\nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Annotation as ORM;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\Entity()\r\n * @ORM\\Table(name=\"test_responses\")\r\n * @ORM\\InheritanceType(\"SINGLE_TABLE\")\r\n * @ORM\\DiscriminatorColumn(name=\"discr\", type=\"string\")\r\n * @ORM\\DiscriminatorMap({\r\n *     \"array\"       = ArrayResponse::class,\r\n *     \"text\"        = TextResponse::class,\r\n * })\r\n */\r\nabstract class AbstractResponse {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Id @ORM\\GeneratedValue\r\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=\"integer\")\r\n     */\r\n    public $id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate two child classes. Each class defines the same property with different types.\r\nThe first class use the type `simple_array` and the second class has a `string` property :\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\Entity()\r\n */\r\nclass ArrayResponse extends AbstractResponse {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Column(name=\"value_array\", type=\"simple_array\")\r\n     *\r\n     * @var array\r\n     */\r\n    public $value = [];\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\Entity()\r\n */\r\nclass TextResponse extends AbstractResponse {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Column(name=\"value_string\", type=\"string\")\r\n     *\r\n     * @var string|null\r\n     */\r\n    public $value = null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate an instance of the second class and flush the `EntityManager`:\r\n```php\r\n$textResponse = new TextResponse();\r\n$em->persist($textResponse);\r\n$em->flush();\r\n```\r\n\r\nClear the `EntityManager` and fetch the instance:\r\n```php\r\n$em->clear();\r\n\r\n/** @var TextResponse $arrayResponse */\r\n$textResponse = $em->getRepository(AbstractResponse::class)\r\n                   ->find($textResponse->id);\r\n\r\nvar_dump($textResponse->value); // Display an empty array (type error)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe value of `$textResponse->value` should be NULL, because the property `$value` of class `TextResponse` has type `string|null`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/7505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/7505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
