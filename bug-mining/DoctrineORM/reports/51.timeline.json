I was about to open a ticket about that, too (was thinking something along the lines of \"`getReference()` can corrupt `UnitOfWork` internal state\").\r\n\r\nA stern warning in the documentation can't hurt, but realistically, it won't prevent many errors either. I suppose there are no sanity checks in this method because of performance, but it's a bit absurd that I can have an entity with an autoincrement ID field, and then get a reference for id `-1` and for id `\"some random string\"` (but ok, those totally invalid references won't cause collisions later on). \r\n\r\nIt would be nice it doctrine had some way of handling these invalid references gracefully. E.g. if `addToIdentityMap` detects a collision and sees the existing entry is a reference, it could try to load it and if that fails remove it and replace it with the new entity. But I don't know if that detection can be made 100% reliable.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/1606063444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flack","id":425166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack","html_url":"https://github.com/flack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9629626035,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAkff85psVTYzwAAAAI9-G6z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/events/9629626035","actor":{"login":"mpdude","id":1202333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude","html_url":"https://github.com/mpdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-25T12:20:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9629626036,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAkff85psVTYzwAAAAI9-G60","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/events/9629626036","actor":{"login":"mpdude","id":1202333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude","html_url":"https://github.com/mpdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-25T12:20:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"flack","id":425166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack","html_url":"https://github.com/flack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-25T13:03:04Z","updated_at":"2023-06-25T13:03:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10785","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10785/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10785/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10785/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/pull/10785","id":1769331410,"no

trying to understand #3037, I found that it may happen that we have more entries in `\\Doctrine\\ORM\\UnitOfWork::$entityIdentifiers` than in `\\Doctrine\\ORM\\UnitOfWork::$identityMap`.\r\n\r\nThe former is a mapping from `spl_object_id` values to ID hashes, the latter an array first of entity class names and then from ID hash to entity object instances.\r\n\r\n(Basically, \"ID hash\" is a concatenation of all field values making up the `@Id` for a given entity.)\r\n\r\nThis means that at some point, we must have _different_ objects representing the same entity, or at least over time different objects are used for the same entity without the UoW properly updating its `::$entityIdentifiers` structure.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to overwrite an entity in the identity map, since that means a currently `MANAGED` entity is replaced with something else.\r\n\r\nIf it makes sense at all to _replace_ an entity, that should happen through dedicated management methods to first detach the old entity before persisting, merging or otherwise adding the new one. This way we could make sure the internal structures remain consistent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"flack","id":425166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack","html_url":"https://github.com/flack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-25T13:26:38Z","updated_at":"2023-06-25T13:26:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/843","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/843/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/843/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/843/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/pull/843","id":22341519,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTc5NzQwMA==","number":843,"title":"[DDC-2785]

false);\r\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/1606154460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flack","id":425166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack","html_url":"https://github.com/flack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mpdude","id":1202333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude","html_url":"https://github.com/mpdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-25T21:46:24Z","updated_at":"2023-06-25T21:46:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10800","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10800/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10800/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10800/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/pull/10800","id":1773504239,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAkff85T2vfl","number":10800,"title":"Explain
