This works with MySQL and SQLite, however fails on PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\nThis patch\r\n\r\n* adds a functional test case that actually tries to run such a query\r\n* applies a fix to `SqlWalker` that makes it output a nested JOIN\r\n* adapts test cases in `SelectSqlGenerationTest` to reflect the change (and make those SQL statements valid -- on PostgreSQL)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/6475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/6475/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1165599669,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDExNjU1OTk2Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/events/1165599669","actor":{"login":"stesie","id":113068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie","html_url":"https://github.com/stesie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4ec20c7217f9c36867e3ad59669496d9ca4007a2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stesie/doctrine2/commits/4ec20c7217f9c36867e3ad59669496d9ca4007a2","created_at":"2017-07-16T14:44:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1165599670,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDExNjU1OTk2NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/events/1165599670","actor":{"login":"stesie","id":113068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie","html_url":"https://github.com/stesie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eaa3b97794ade3d5b6cfc895b7632212dc54a7df","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stesie/doctrine2/commits/eaa3b97794ade3d5b6cfc895b7632212dc54a7df","created_at":"2017-07-16T14:44:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1184476975,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDExODQ0NzY5NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/events/1184476975","actor":{"login":"stesie","id":113068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzA2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie","html_url":"https://github.com/stesie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stesie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"86ef212b17bf030c2aa3580d83ab6eb015f26be4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stesie/doctrine2/commits/86ef212b17bf030c2aa3580d83ab6eb015f26be4","created_at":"2017-07-29T10:45:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1203181311,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyMDMxODEzMTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/events/1203181311","actor":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subs
