reporting a BC break, please consult the upgrading document to make sure it's not an expected change: https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/master/UPGRADE.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### BC Break Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the relevant information below to help triage your issue. -->\r\n\r\n|    Q        |   A\r\n|------------ | ------\r\n| BC Break    | yes\r\n| Version     | 2.6.1\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a summary describing the problem you are experiencing. -->\r\nAfter upgrading from 2.5.14 to 2.6.1 StringPrimary no longer accepts aggregate functions as argument(AVG, SUM, COUNT, MIN and MAX).\r\nWhich affects any functions depending on StringPrimary, for example CONCAT\r\n#### Previous behavior\r\n`CONCAT(teable.field1, MAX(table.field2))` => '{text from field1}{maximum value of field2}'\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n`CONCAT(teable.field1, MAX(table.field2))` => ERROR: Expected StateFieldPathExpression | string | InputParameter | FunctionsReturningStrings | AggregateExpression, got 'MAX'\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\npass any aggregate function to CONCAT (for example) as argument\r\n\r\n#### PS\r\n\r\nOld `StringPrimary` function looked like:\r\n``` \r\n            case Lexer::T_CASE:\r\n            case Lexer::T_COALESCE:\r\n            case Lexer::T_NULLIF:\r\n                return $this->CaseExpression();\r\n\r\n            default:\r\n                if ($this->isAggregateFunction($lookaheadType)) {\r\n                    return $this->AggregateExpression();\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n        $this->syntaxError(\r\n            'StateFieldPathExpression | string | InputParameter | FunctionsReturningStrings | AggregateExpression'\r\n        );\r\n```\r\nwhile new one missing part responsible for accepting aggregate expressions:\r\n```\r\n            case Lexer::T_CASE:\r\n            case Lexer::T_COALESCE:\r\n            case Lexer::T_NULLIF:\r\n                return $this->CaseExpression();\r\n        }\r\n        $this->syntaxError(\r\n            'StateFieldPathExpression | string | InputParameter | FunctionsReturningStrings | AggregateExpression'\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating this as separate issue from #7205, because this concerns any function relient on
