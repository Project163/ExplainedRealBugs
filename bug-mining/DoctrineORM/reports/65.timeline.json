Would also be consistent with things like `joinColumns` on the `JoinTable` attribute. My only concern is how can we prevent namespace collision with the existing `Index` attribute? Or would the existing `Index` attribute be used for this? If so, then we have the issue again of nonsensical fields such as `fields` and `columns`.\n\n> the interface you propose is a bit flawed as it allows for nonsensical stuf like (index: false, indexFlags: ['some flags'])\n\nSame is true for any other existing mapping attribute that accepts an array in any argument. My thought process was just to keep things consistent with the current options that already exist, such as the existing `unique` flag on `Column`.\n\nBut if that is not a primary concern, then my preference goes towards your options of either a new `Indexed` attribute or adding the nested `Index` in `Column`.\n\nIf we can agree on what it'd look like for users, I could investigate the implementation details for the schema tool and create a
