If yes, a solution would be to use `getErrorStyle()` to send this to the badly named `stderr`, that should be used for messages targeted at humans. That way you would only get SQL on stdout.

To me they should also go to stderr since they are part of a notification to a human of what is going to happen.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/688407249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"greg0ire","id":657779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/657779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire","html_url":"https://github.com/greg0ire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/688961136","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/8263#issuecomment-688961136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/8263","id":688961136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4ODk2MTEzNg==","user":{"login":"cmahnke","id":194820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDgyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke","html_url":"https://github.com/cmahnke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmahnke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-08T15:37:42Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T15:37:42Z","body":"You're right, I've tried to used it in a multi staged  Docker build.
