Any tips are appreciated. I'm not too sure what the test suite should and should not cover. \n\nOther questions I have include:\n1. Should the `HYDRATE*ARBITRARY*OBJECT` constant be added to the `AbstractQuery` class or the `NativeQuery` class? It only makes sense in the former but it might be missed when more constants are added in the future...\n2. Should I use data providers in my tests for the result set data?\n3. Should my tests be added to a `DDC1819` namespace?\n4. Should I add functional tests?\n","closed_by":{"login":"beberlei","id":26936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei","html_url":"https://github.com/beberlei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beberlei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/2478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/2478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
