PR will make the annotations and attribute mapping drivers report mapping configuration for the classes where it is declared, instead of omitting it and reporting it for subclasses only. This is necessary to be able to catch mis-configurations in `ClassMetadataFactory`.\r\n\r\nFixes #10417, closes #10450, closes #10454.\r\n\r\n**DoctrineBundle** users: A new config setting to opt-in to the new mode will be implemented in https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/pull/1661.\r\n\r\n#### ⚠️ Summary for users getting `MappingExceptions` with the new mode\r\n\r\nWhen you set the `$reportFieldsWhereDeclared` constructor parameters to `true` for the AnnotationDriver and/or AttributesDriver and get `MappingExceptions`, you may be doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n* Using `private` fields with the same name in different classes of an entity inheritance hierarchy (see #10450)\r\n* Redeclaring/overwriting mapped properties inherited from mapped superclasses and/or other entities (see #10454)\r\n\r\nAs explained in these two PRs, the ORM cannot (or at least, was not designed to) support such configurations. Unfortunately, due to the old – now deprecated – driver behaviour, the misconfigurations could not be detected, and due to previously missing tests, this in turn was not noticed.\r\n\r\n#### Current situation\r\n\r\nThe annotations mapping driver has the following condition to skip properties that are reported by the PHP reflection API:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/doctrine/orm/blob/69c7791ba256d947ddb1aafe5f2439ab31704937/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Mapping/Driver/AnnotationDriver.php#L345-L357\r\n\r\nThis code has been there basically unchanged since the initial 2.0 release. The same condition can be found in the attribute driver, probably it has been copied when attributes were added.\r\n\r\nI _think_ what the driver tries to do here is to deal with the fact that Reflection will also report `public`/`protected` properties inherited from parent classes. This is supported by the observation (see #5744) that e. g. YAML and XML drivers do not contain this logic.\r\n\r\nThe conditions are not precise enough for edge cases. They lead to some fields and configuration values not even being reported by the driver. \r\n\r\nOnly since the fields would be \"discovered\" again when reflecting on subclasses, they eventually end up in class metadata structures for the subclasses. In one case of inherited ID generator mappings, the `ClassMetadataFactory` would also rely on this behaviour.\r\n\r\nTwo potential bugs that can result from this are demonstrated in #10450 and #10454.\r\n\r\n#### Suggested solution\r\n\r\nIn order to find a more reliable way of separating properties that are merely reported again in subclasses from those that are actual re-declarations, use the information already available in `ClassMetadata`. In particular, `declared` tells us in which non-transient class a \"field\" was first seen.\r\n\r\nMake the mapping driver skip only those properties for which we already know that they have been declared in parent classes, and skip them only when the observed declaring class matches the expectation. \r\n\r\nFor all other properties, report them to `ClassMetadataFactory` and let that deal with consistency checking/error handling.\r\n\r\n#10450 and #10454 are merged into this PR to show that they pass now.\r\n\r\n#### Soft deprecation strategy\r\n\r\nTo avoid throwing new/surprising exceptions (even for misconfigurations) during a minor version upgrade, the new driver mode is opt-in.\r\n\r\nUsers will have to set the `$reportFieldsWhereDeclared` constructor parameters to `true` for the `AnnotationDriver` and/or `AttributesDriver`. Unless they do so, a deprecation warning will be raised.\r\n\r\nIn 3.0, the \"new\" mode will become the default. The constructor parameter can be deprecated (as of ORM 3.1, probably) and is a no-op.\r\n\r\nWe need to follow up in other places (DoctrineBundle, ... – what else?) to make this driver parameter an easy-to-change configuration setting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10455/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mpdude","id":1202333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude","html_url":"https://github.com/mpdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-02T21:27:38Z","updated_at":"2023-09-02T21:27:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/issues/2659","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/issues/2659/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/issues/2659/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/issues/2659/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/issues/2659","id":1831476688,"node_id":"I_kwDOAA2DDc5tKh3Q","number":2659,"title":"Not

just upgraded the package from version 1.1.1 to version 1.1.3, but I am now getting the following error when I try to log in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn exception occurred while executing 'SELECT

NEXTVAL('refresh_tokens_id_seq')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is because the table of the RefreshToken has a specific name:\r\n```php\r\n#[ORM\\Entity]\r\n#[ORM\\Table(name: 'user_refresh_tokens')]\r\nclass RefreshToken extends BaseRefreshToken\r\n{ }\r\n```\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an actual workaround, as it is what the `bin/console d:s:u --dump-sql` suggests: Dropping the old sequence called `user_refresh_tokens_id_seq` and create the new like\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE SEQUENCE refresh_tokens_id_seq INCREMENT BY 1 MINVALUE 1 START 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but makes it necessary to make some kind of migration for production environments because we're already running a sequence on `user_refresh_tokens_id_seq`.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIs there a way to avoid that, because the old sequence was made by the package in its previous version. So it seems like it is missing some kind of backwards compatibility.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markitosgv/JWTRefreshTokenBundle/issues/364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markitosgv/JWTRefreshTokenBundle/issues/364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"NoiseByNorthwest","id":1461284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjEyODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1461284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest","html_url":"https://github.com/NoiseByNorthwest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NoiseByNorthwest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-26T16:09:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T16:09:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10953","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10953/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10953/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10953/events","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/10953","id":1913769110,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAkff85yEcyW","number":10953,"title":"All

Bug Report\r\n\r\nAll sequences merged into one since the merge of #10455\r\n\r\n|    Q        |   A\r\n|------------ | ------\r\n| BC Break    | yes if the generated SQL (DDL) is an API boundary\r\n| Version     | 2.16.2 (last known good 2.15.5)\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nSince the upgrade of doctrine/orm from 2.15.5 to 2.16.2 all sequences, as resolved by ClassMetadataFactory, are replaced by a single one.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a side effect of #10455.\r\nIs it a bug ?\r\nOr is there a way (config ?) or recommended workaround to have the original behavior ?\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nSince 2.16 (2.16.2) all concrete classes now share the same sequence, which has BTW a name based on the super class's one.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nWe have a sequence defined in a mapped super class\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\HasLifecycleCallbacks\r\n * @ORM\\MappedSuperclass\r\n */\r\nabstract class BaseModel\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Id\r\n     * @ORM\\GeneratedValue\r\n     * @ORM\\Column( type = \"integer\", name = \"id\" )\r\n     *\r\n     * @readonly\r\n     */\r\n    private int $id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\Entity\r\n * @ORM\\Table\r\n */\r\nclass Foo extends BaseModel\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\Entity\r\n * @ORM\\Table\r\n */\r\nclass Bar extends BaseModel\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBefore 2.16 (2.15.5) all concrete classes had their own sequence.\r\nThat means, with the provided reproducer, that Foo and Bar must have their own sequence.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10953/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/1757082981","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/10927#issuecomment-1757082981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10927","id":1757082981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAkff85ouvVl","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-11T08:10:12Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T08:56:59Z","body":"Hello

reported that #10455 broke the way how the default `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` is created and inherited by subclasses for ID columns using `@GeneratedValue(strategy=\"SEQUENCE\")`.\r\n\r\nFirst, I had to understand how `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` has been handled before #10455 when entity inheritance comes into play:\r\n\r\n* Entity and mapped superclasses inherit the ID generator type (as given by `@GeneratedValue`) from their parent classes\r\n* `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition`, however, is not generally inherited\r\n* ... instead, a default sequence generator definition is created for every class when no explicit configuration is given. In this case, sequence names are based on the current class' table name.\r\n* Once a root entity has been identified, all subclasses inherit its sequence generator definition unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Why did #10455 break this?\r\n\r\nWhen I implemented #10455, I was mislead by two tests `BasicInheritanceMappingTest::testGeneratedValueFromMappedSuperclass` and `BasicInheritanceMappingTest::testMultipleMappedSuperclasses`.\r\n\r\nThese tests check the sequence generator definition that is inherited by an entity class from a mapped superclass, either directly or through an additional (intermediate) mapped superclass.\r\n\r\nThe tests expect the sequence generator definition on the entity _to be the same_ as on the base mapped superclass.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the tests worked before was the quirky behaviour of the annotation and attribute drivers that #10455 was aiming at: The drivers did not report the `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` on the base mapped superclass where it was actually defined. Instead, they reported this `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` for the entity class only.\r\n\r\nThis means the inheritance rules stated above did not take effect, since the ID field with the sequence generator was virtually pushed down to the entity class.\r\n\r\nIn #10455, I did not realize that these failing tests had to do with the quirky and changed mapping driver behaviour. Instead, I tried to \"fix\" the inheritance rules by passing along the sequence generator definition unchanged once the ID column had been defined.\r\n\r\n#### Consequences of the change suggested here\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the changes made to `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` inheritance behaviour that were done in #10455.\r\n\r\nThis means that with the new \"report fields where declared\" driver mode (which is active in our functional tests) we can not expect the sequence generator definition to be inherited from mapped superclasses. The two test cases from `BasicInheritanceMappingTest` are removed.\r\n\r\nI will leave a notice in #10455 to indicate that the new driver mode also affects sequence generator definitions.\r\n\r\nThe `GH10927Test` test case validates the sequence names generated in a few cases. In fact, I wrote this test against the `2.15.x` branch to make sure we get results that are consistent with the previous behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis also means `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` on mapped superclasses is pointless: The mapped superclass does not make use of the definition itself (it has no table), and the setting is never inherited to child classes.\r\n \r\nFixes #10927. There is another implementation with slightly different inheritance semantics in #11052, in case the fix is not good enough and we'd need to review the topic later on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/11050/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/11050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10879618257,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAkff85v398czwAAAAKIeczR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/events/10879618257","actor":{"login":"mpdude","id":1202333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude","html_url":"https://github.com/mpdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e3a360d63bc4f2f87ee7fed0df984254e03bebf0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/commits/e3a360d63bc4f2f87ee7fed0df984254e03bebf0","created_at":"2023-11-06T22:53:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/1796996828","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/10927#issuecomment-1796996828","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10927","id":1796996828,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAkff85rG_7c","user":{"login":"mpdude","id":1202333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude","html_url":"https://github.com/mpdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-06T22:58:57Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T21:38:53Z","body":"I see two ways how this could be fixed. \r\n\r\nThe first one is in #11050. It reverts the way inheritance works for `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` and mapped superclasses.

It will recognize when an explicit `@SequenceGeneratorDefinition` is used and pass that one on unchanged to child classes (= all use the same sequence name). Otherwise, the default one will be generated for every single class, so the sequence name is based on the table name.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/1796996828/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mpdude","id":1202333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDIzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1202333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude","html_url":"https://github.com/mpdude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpdude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/comments/1797951491","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/orm/issues/10927#issuecomment-1797951491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/10927","id":1797951491,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAkff85rKpAD","user":{"login":"Chris53897","id":7104259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7104259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris53897","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris53897/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-07T07:29:55Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T07:29:55Z","body":"@mpdude I have tested your solution.
