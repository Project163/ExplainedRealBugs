this** since #10473 was merged; it removed the check altogether.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the check that a mapped superclass does not declare to-many associations to a more suitable (IMHO) place.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer checked when another class inherits the association from the mapped superclass, but at the final runtime validation stage when loading the metadata for the mapped superclass itself.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, can we review whether the check is correct for the case where we have \r\n\r\n* a base entity class with a to-many (non-owning) association\r\n* a mapped superclass below it\r\n* possibly another entity class below that\r\n\r\nIn other words, only the mapped superclass may not define to-many associations, but it is fine if an entity class above it does and when an entity class below inherits all that? My feeling is that should be fine.\r\n

does not allow toMany associations to be declared on MappedSuperclasses. The check for this occurs on the child class, which correctly checks whether the parent is a MappedSuperclass.\r\nHowever, it does not check that the field in question was actually declared on that class.

The first test is simply to check that an exception is not thrown in the case described above.

since this is no longer an error condition we need to check for.\r\n\r\n#10473 relaxed the runtime check that mapped superclasses must not use one-to-many associations.

(In addition, #10554 also made it a \"lazy\" (non-runtime) check in the schema validator.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis test case demonstrates a situation where an invalid to-many association on a mapped superclass is not being detected.\r\n\r\nSince at least the annotations and attribute drivers currently skip non-private properties from mapped superclasses (see #10417), the `ClassMetadataFactory` is not even aware of the association on the mapped superclass and so cannot reject it.\r\n\r\nIMHO, we should bail out as soon as we detect this on the mapped superclass. I don't see how we could proceed at that time and try to rescue/fixup the situation afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, maybe an association with a `target` that is a mapped superclass should be rejected in its own right?\r\n\r\nMore details on what happens down the road, just for the sake of completeness:\r\n\r\nWhen the mapping driver processes the entity class with the inherited association, PHP reflection will report the association property. Since the association was not reported for the mapped superclass, the driver thinks (see #10417) this is a \"new\" (non-inherited) field and reports to the `ClassMetadataFactory`.\r\n\r\nThe association will show up as being from `GH10449Entity` to `GH10449ToManyAssociationTarget`.

has been merged through #10455.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis test case demonstrates two situations where an entity inherits from another entity or a mapped superclass. Both (parent and child) classes have a private property named `field`.\r\n\r\nTechnically, that's two properties on two separate classes. Also, the mapping configuration given suggests to put both properties into separate database columns.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ORM was not designed to make this distinction. For example, `ClassMetadata::$fieldMappings` is indexed by \"field name\" – there is no room for juggling with duplicate private fields being declared in different classes. This design limitation that would be very hard to change, should be documented as a limitation and be rejected when it is noticed. The same applies to association mappings and embeddables.\r\n\r\nDue to a quirk in the way the annotation and attribute drivers report fields (see #10417), the property will be skipped on the subclass.

PR will make the annotations and attribute mapping drivers report mapping configuration for the classes where it is declared, instead of omitting it and reporting it for subclasses only. This is necessary to be able to catch mis-configurations in `ClassMetadataFactory`.\r\n\r\nFixes #10417, closes #10450, closes #10454.\r\n\r\n**DoctrineBundle** users: A new config setting to opt-in to the new mode will be implemented in https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle/pull/1661.\r\n\r\n#### ⚠️ Summary for users getting `MappingExceptions` with the new mode\r\n\r\nWhen you set the `$reportFieldsWhereDeclared` constructor parameters to `true` for the AnnotationDriver and/or AttributesDriver and get `MappingExceptions`, you may be doing one of the following:\r\n\r\n* Using `private` fields with the same name in different classes of an entity inheritance hierarchy (see #10450)\r\n* Redeclaring/overwriting mapped properties inherited from mapped superclasses and/or other entities (see #10454)\r\n\r\nAs explained in these two PRs, the ORM cannot (or at least, was not designed to) support such configurations. Unfortunately, due to the old – now deprecated – driver behaviour, the misconfigurations could not be detected, and due to previously missing tests, this in turn was not noticed.\r\n\r\n#### Current situation\r\n\r\nThe annotations mapping driver has the following condition to skip properties that are reported by the PHP reflection API:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/doctrine/orm/blob/69c7791ba256d947ddb1aafe5f2439ab31704937/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Mapping/Driver/AnnotationDriver.php#L345-L357\r\n\r\nThis code has been there basically unchanged since the initial 2.0 release. The same condition can be found in the attribute driver, probably it has been copied when attributes were added.\r\n\r\nI _think_ what the driver tries to do here is to deal with the fact that Reflection will also report `public`/`protected` properties inherited from parent classes. This is supported by the observation (see #5744) that e. g. YAML and XML drivers do not contain this logic.\r\n\r\nThe conditions are not precise enough for edge cases. They lead to some fields and configuration values not even being reported by the driver. \r\n\r\nOnly since the fields would be \"discovered\" again when reflecting on subclasses, they eventually end up in class metadata structures for the subclasses. In one case of inherited ID generator mappings, the `ClassMetadataFactory` would also rely on this behaviour.\r\n\r\nTwo potential bugs that can result from this are demonstrated in #10450 and #10454.\r\n\r\n#### Suggested solution\r\n\r\nIn order to find a more reliable way of separating properties that are merely reported again in subclasses from those that are actual re-declarations, use the information already available in `ClassMetadata`. In particular, `declared` tells us in which non-transient class a \"field\" was first seen.\r\n\r\nMake the mapping driver skip only those properties for which we already know that they have been declared in parent classes, and skip them only when the observed declaring class matches the expectation. \r\n\r\nFor all other properties, report them to `ClassMetadataFactory` and let that deal with consistency checking/error handling.\r\n\r\n#10450 and #10454 are merged into this PR to show that they pass now.\r\n\r\n#### Soft deprecation strategy\r\n\r\nTo avoid throwing new/surprising exceptions (even for misconfigurations) during a minor version upgrade, the new driver mode is opt-in.\r\n\r\nUsers will have to set the `$reportFieldsWhereDeclared` constructor parameters to `true` for the `AnnotationDriver` and/or `AttributesDriver`. Unless they do so, a deprecation warning will be raised.\r\n\r\nIn 3.0, the \"new\" mode will become the default. The constructor parameter can be deprecated (as of ORM 3.1, probably) and is a no-op.\r\n\r\nWe need to follow up in other places (DoctrineBundle, ... – what else?) to make this driver parameter an easy-to-change configuration
