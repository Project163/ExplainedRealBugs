get an error on cloning entity proxy following an upgrade from Doctrine 2.3 to 2.4 (but maybe relevant for 2.5 too).\n\nThe error is that fields declared as private on a MappedSuperClass are not cloned when a clone is done on a proxy entity of child class, only the protected fields of the MappedSuperClass are cloned.\n\nThis is a breaking change for us because it is only partially cloning entity and could have cause loss of data.\n\nThe cause is the usage of ClassMetadataInfo->getReflectionClass()->getProperties() rather than ClassMetadataInfo->reflFields in the cloning process.\n\nI didn't find any existing issue or documentation about that, is it a known issue ?\n\nIs there a clean solution existing to this issue please ?\n\nBelow the context information, the code analyse and the workaround solution.\n\nThanks in advance for your feedback on this issue.\n\nBest regards,\nChristophe\n\n**Context**\n\n```\nuname -a\nLinux 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.73-2+deb7u2 x86_64

Proxy was simple\n\n``` php\n    public function __clone()\n    {\n        if (!$this->__isInitialized__ && $this->_entityPersister) {\n            $this->__isInitialized__ = true;\n            $class = $this->_entityPersister->getClassMetadata();\n            $original = $this->_entityPersister->load($this->_identifier);\n            if ($original === null) {\n                throw new \\Doctrine\\ORM\\EntityNotFoundException();\n            }\n            foreach ($class->reflFields as $field => $reflProperty) {\n                $reflProperty->setValue($this, $reflProperty->getValue($original));\n            }\n            unset($this->_entityPersister, $this->_identifier);\n        }\n\n    }\n```\n\n===> Cloning use the public property `ClassMetadataInfo->reflFields` in order to process the copy of fields\n\nin Doctrine 2.4, the clone method delegate the process to a callback method which comes that we can see in ProxyFactory.createCloner method\n\n``` php\n    function (BaseProxy $proxy) use ($entityPersister, $classMetadata) {\n        if ($proxy->__isInitialized()) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $proxy->__setInitialized(true);\n        $proxy->__setInitializer(null);\n        $class = $entityPersister->getClassMetadata();\n        $original = $entityPersister->load($classMetadata->getIdentifierValues($proxy));\n\n        if (null === $original) {\n            throw new EntityNotFoundException();\n        }\n\n        foreach ($class->getReflectionClass()->getProperties() as $reflectionProperty) {\n            $propertyName = $reflectionProperty->getName();\n\n            if ($class->hasField($propertyName) || $class->hasAssociation($propertyName)) {\n                $reflectionProperty->setAccessible(true);\n                $reflectionProperty->setValue($proxy, $reflectionProperty->getValue($original));\n            }\n        }\n    };\n```\n\n====> Cloning use `ClassMetadataInfo->getReflectionClass()->getProperties()` in order to process the copy of fields\n\nIn our use case, `ClassMetadataInfo->reflFields` was containing all the fields of the entity and its superclass, private+protected, but `ClassMetadataInfo->getReflectionClass()->getProperties()` returns only protected fields of the superclass.\n\nSo it's only copying partially the entity.\n\n**Workaround**\n\nDeclare all the fields of the `MappedSuperClass` as protected, rather than private\n","closed_by":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5755/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
