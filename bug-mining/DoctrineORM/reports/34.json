So phpstan is considering it as an error.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/doctrine/orm/blob/2.10.x/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Mapping/ClassMetadataInfo.php#L451, `fieldMappings` property is defined with:\r\n```\r\n     * @psalm-var array<string, array{\r\n     *      type: string,\r\n     *      fieldName: string,\r\n     *      columnName?: string,\r\n     *      length?: int,\r\n     *      id?: bool,\r\n     *      nullable?: bool,\r\n     *      columnDefinition?: string,\r\n     *      precision?: int,\r\n     *      scale?: int,\r\n     *      unique?: string,\r\n     *      inherited?: class-string,\r\n     *      originalClass?: class-string,\r\n     *      originalField?: string,\r\n     *      quoted?: bool,\r\n     *      requireSQLConversion?: bool,\r\n     *      declared?: class-string,\r\n     *      declaredField?: string,\r\n     *      options: array<mixed>\r\n     * }>\r\n```\r\nBut in https://github.com/doctrine/orm/blob/2.10.x/lib/Doctrine/ORM/Mapping/ClassMetadataInfo.php#L1303, `getFieldMapping `method is defined to return:\r\n```\r\n     * @psalm-return array{\r\n     *      type: string,\r\n     *      fieldName: string,\r\n     *      columnName?: string,\r\n     *      inherited?: class-string,\r\n     *      nullable?: bool,\r\n     *      originalClass?: class-string,\r\n     *      originalField?: string,\r\n     *      scale?: int,\r\n     *      precision?: int,\r\n     *      length?: int\r\n     * }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on fixing issues due to upgrading phpstan to 1.x on API Platform, those lines (https://github.com/api-platform/core/blob/main/src/Doctrine/Orm/Metadata/Property/DoctrineOrmPropertyMetadataFactory.php#L80):\r\n```\r\n$fieldMapping = $doctrineClassMetadata->getFieldMapping($property);\r\n$propertyMetadata = $propertyMetadata->withDefault($fieldMapping['options']['default'] ?? $propertyMetadata->getDefault());\r\n```\r\ngenerate this error in phpstan: \r\n```\r\nOffset 'options' on array{type: string, fieldName: string, columnName?: string, inherited?: class-string, nullable?: bool, originalClass?: class-string, originalField?: string, scale?: int, ...} on left side of ?? does not exist.   \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view but I may be wrong, @psalm-return annotation should be the same as in property definition.\r\n\r\n\r\nI may provide a PR to change this if it is needed.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"greg0ire","id":657779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/657779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire","html_url":"https://github.com/greg0ire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/9193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/9193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
