`http://localhost:8000/api/graphql/graphql_playground`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Error message\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  Context: Calling Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping\\ClassMetadata::getAssociationMappedByTargetField() with \"role\", which is the owning side of an association.\r\n  Problem: The owning side of an association has no \"mappedBy\" field.\r\n  Solution: Call Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping\\ClassMetadata::isAssociationInverseSide() to check first in .\r\n   (which is being imported from \"C:\\zein_workspace\\FAST\\fast-api\\config/routes/api_platform.yaml\")\r\n
