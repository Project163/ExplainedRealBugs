After setting the PHP-version to `^8.2` and running `composer update`, Symfony automatically runs `symfony console cache:clear` for us. Then the following error appears:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ symfony console cache:clear\r\n\r\n [WARNING] Some commands could not be registered:                                                                       \r\n\r\nIn XmlDriver.php line 1006:\r\n\r\n  Warning: DOMDocument::schemaValidate(): Invalid Schema\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I go to that line, it shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n    $document = new DOMDocument();\r\n    $document->load($file);\r\n\r\n    if (! $document->schemaValidate(__DIR__ .

Symfony didn't complain about this while I was still on version PHP 7.4.\r\n\r\nObviously the recommended approach is to move away from this library, but maybe someone knows a quick fix for this.
