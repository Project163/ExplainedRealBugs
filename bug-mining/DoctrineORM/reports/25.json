While those arguments were always considered \"required\" in a pure doctrine environment, we partially enhanced the DX by extracting some information for the annotations from other reflection data (like the `targetEntity`/`class` the annotation targets). Hence we have usage of doctrine annotations like:\r\n```\r\n@var Collection<SomeEntity>\r\n@ORM\\ManyToMany\r\n```\r\nwhich now breaks, because the ManyToMany is attempted to be constructed with `null` as `targetEntity` in the DocParser. Until now we solved the \"missing\" targetEntity (and other things) via a custom `AnnotationDriver` and that worked out quite nicely. With this change we are at a loss though, because we'd need to hook into the DocParser now, which happens way too early.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2487#issuecomment-850405128\r\n\r\nWhile we can \"solve\" this by restricting doctrine/orm to <2.9, we would also like to move towards PHP8 support and attributes. For us the best solution would be if those three constructors would allow `null` for their first argument, but I understand that would mean you'd need to check for that `null` at runtime which is a step backward. Optimally the Annotation would not be instanciated until it is used for mapping, but that would be too great a change.\r\nAre there any other possible ways to \"enhance\" the annotations and hook into the instanciation process?","closed_by":{"login":"greg0ire","id":657779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Nzc3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/657779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire","html_url":"https://github.com/greg0ire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greg0ire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/8753/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/8753/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
