I was thought out and running on less than 4 hours sleep for the 3rd night running (sick kids and sick dad). So I lazily Googled \"what does BC Break mean?\" and got a hit back in a doctrine bug report from the same template that said \"I don't know what this means\". I immediately felt a strong kinship with the previous filer, even if Google (complete with AI feedback) didn't know either. If it says: _Does this break backwards compatibility?_ then it would be even easier to decipher.
