`Doctrine\\ORM\\Tools\\SchemaTool::updateSchema` the documentation states that \"If $saveMode is set to true the command is executed in the Database, else SQL is returned.\". That is wrong since the method never returns anything.\nWhat actually happens when `$saveMode` is true is that the method calls `toSaveSql` instead of `toSql` in `SchemaDiff` which produces a non-destructive update. The details can be found in the documentation of `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Schema\\SchemaDiff::toSaveSql()`. This is very useful, for example, when you want to do a partial update of the schema, you need `$saveMode` set to true otherwise `updateSchema` would drop all the tables not included in the update, learned that the hard way.\n","closed_by":{"login":"deeky666","id":1411514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTE1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1411514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666","html_url":"https://github.com/deeky666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deeky666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/5596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
