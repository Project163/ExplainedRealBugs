I don't know whether Doctrine is able to return native `false` for DBMS-es supporting it and how to support that case if it's needed.","closed_by":{"login":"derrabus","id":1506493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDY0OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1506493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus","html_url":"https://github.com/derrabus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derrabus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/9230/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/orm/issues/9230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
