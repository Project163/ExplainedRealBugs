wanted to highlight field values, not field names, etc. So I wrote a custom implementation, looking like this (adapting the output from `zerolog`'s README):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmi/consolelog/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nI've realized that my needs are probably not unique (see https://github.com/rs/zerolog/issues/34), and that it would be nice to expose a customizable `ConsoleWriter`. Therefore, I've extracted what I did in the project into a library, available at https://github.com/karmi/consolelog, since I didn't want to just blindly send code your way.\r\n\r\nMy question is: is this something you would consider interesting to have in the `zerolog` library itself?
