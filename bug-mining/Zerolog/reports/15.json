If you configure 2 writers and the first one fails  you get no output at all. This is very confusing to users and very hard to debug. We hit this in our code when running a Windows service and stderr was closed by Windows causing ConsoleWriter to fail. Current behavior depends on the order in which you configured the writers. Instead MultiLevelWriter should aggregate errors and return a single error.","closed_by":{"login":"rs","id":68232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs","html_url":"https://github.com/rs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
