And I think it is an unfortunate case of \"works as designed by Go\". I have no idea if there is a need for a change; or how to fix this holistically.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Inner workings of `ConsoleWriter`\r\nA `ConsoleWriter` takes the structured log output of zerolog as an argument and uses a `json.Decoder` to recreate a key-value map from it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rs/zerolog/blob/55aaf043cf4d84249a6d2344ef18d82279d08955/console.go#L118-L125\r\n\r\nIt extracts the `time` field as a `string` in the format specified by `zerolog.TimeFieldFormat`. For instance, this byte array is copied from a debug session (using the default time format).\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2022-10-06T20:04:38+02:00\",\"message\":\"wrong time default\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nLater, zerolog uses the closure as returned by `consoleDefaultFormatTimestamp()` to parse & format the extracted time.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rs/zerolog/blob/55aaf043cf4d84249a6d2344ef18d82279d08955/console.go#L339-L345\r\n\r\nIt uses `zerolog.TimeFieldFormat` to parse the extracted time from `string` to `time.Time`. That is rightfully so because that is the exact time layout used to format the time in the first place.\r\n\r\nThen it uses the time format layout given to the `ConsoleWriter` on creation by `TimeFormat`:\r\n```go\r\nzerolog.ConsoleWriter{Out: os.Stderr, TimeFormat: \"<here time format for console writer output>\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we take the parsed `time.Time`, convert it into our local time zone and format it as specified by `TimeFormat`:\r\n```go\r\nts.Local().Format(timeFormat) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is the time string, as we see it printed later.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reason for the observed behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `time.Parse()` method handles time layouts without a time zone indicator by assuming UTC.\r\n\r\nSource: [Go documentation for time package](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Parse)\r\n> In the absence of a time zone indicator, `time.Parse()` returns a time in UTC.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nRemember above that we use `zerolog.TimeFieldFormat` to format and then parse the time again?\r\nIn your example, the format is `\"2006-01-02 15:04:05\"` ... no time zone indicator.\r\n\r\nLet's say `ConsoleWriter` sees the following log:\r\n```json\r\n{\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2022-10-06 20:54:52\",\"message\":\"wrong time default\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nParsing it again leads to \"2022-10-06 20:54:52 **UTC**\" (due to the missing time zone indicator).\r\nThe formatting with `ts.Local().Format(timeFormat)` then converts from UTC to your local time zone again.\r\nAdding or subtracting the hours accordingly. Leading to the wrong output.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a time zone indicator to your layout so Go doesn't end up assuming UTC.\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntimeFormat := \"2006-01-02 15:04:05 MST\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaybe a diagram is more accessible than my kind of unstructured thoughts.\r\n\r\nThis happens when we use a time format without a time zone indicator. Go assumes UTC, and we falsely convert from UTC to our time zone again.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7292949/194399243-634724ef-92f7-4372-adfd-287cc5341ebc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand: If we use a time format **with** a time zone indicator, Go can restore the time zone, doesn't convert, and the result is correct.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7292949/194398805-bf4ec9d7-06a0-41df-9db4-94f4b571f002.png)\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/comments/1270563988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pscheid92","id":7292949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTI5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7292949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92","html_url":"https://github.com/pscheid92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pscheid92/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/comments/1274647817","html_url":"https://github.com/rs/zerolog/issues/483#issuecomment-1274647817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/483","id":1274647817,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBW1hkM5L-ZUJ","user":{"login":"bagualing","id":5525630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjU2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5525630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing","html_url":"https://github.com/bagualing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bagualing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-11T12:57:09Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T12:57:09Z","body":"@pscheid92
