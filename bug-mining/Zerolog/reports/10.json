Therefore, I've extracted what I did in the project into a library, available at https://github.com/karmi/consolelog, since I didn't want to just blindly send code your way.\r\n\r\nMy question is: is this something you would consider interesting to have in the `zerolog` library itself? If so, I can move the implementation into a patch and send a pull request.","closed_by":{"login":"rs","id":68232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs","html_url":"https://github.com/rs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/84/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
