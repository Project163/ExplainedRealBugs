outlined in https://github.com/rs/zerolog/issues/84, this patch refactors the `zerolog.ConsoleWriter` in two ways:\r\n\r\n* The default formatting has been changed to be more sparse and visually attractive\r\n* The formatting logic has been extracted to separate functions, so it can be changed from the user code\r\n\r\nI had to change the design of the [prototype](\r\nhttps://github.com/karmi/consolelog) in order to maintain the backwards compatibility: the prototype has defined default formatting functions (`formatters`) on the concrete instance of `ConsoleWriter`, but without using an initializer, these would be empty. Therefore, I've added a number of defensive checks into `ConsoleWriter.Write()`, and a `ConsoleWriter.Reset()` method. This is not ideal, but I agree that maintaining backwards compatibility is an important goal, and the behaviour is predictable in my testing.\r\n\r\nI've added a benchmark test to make sure I inadverently don't harm the performance: the performance has stayed roughly the same. The tests and examples have been run with the `-race` parameter.\r\n\r\nI've updated the screenshot to reflect the new look, and added a comprehensive example to the README.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1758646433,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NTg2NDY0MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/events/1758646433","actor":{"login":"karmi","id":4790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi","html_url":"https://github.com/karmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d4b6e413f040abdb287df2e3fa69299a40c94926","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/karmi/zerolog/commits/d4b6e413f040abdb287df2e3fa69299a40c94926","created_at":"2018-07-28T19:31:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1759371642,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NTkzNzE2NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/events/1759371642","actor":{"login":"karmi","id":4790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi","html_url":"https://github.com/karmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eddb0134168101748df26c288eb5717ed385c5b2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/karmi/zerolog/commits/eddb0134168101748df26c288eb5717ed385c5b2","created_at":"2018-07-30T06:21:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1759821165,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NTk4MjExNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/events/1759821165","actor":{"login":"karmi","id":4790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi","html_url":"https://github.com/karmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8f792b13a7d756737251eaaca7348b9b2c8959db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/karmi/zerolog/commits/8f792b13a7d756737251eaaca7348b9b2c8959db","created_at":"2018-07-30T10:27:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1931524359,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5MzE1MjQzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rs/zerolog/issues/events/1931524359","actor":{"login":"karmi","id":4790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi","html_url":"https://github.com/karmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karmi/orgs","r
