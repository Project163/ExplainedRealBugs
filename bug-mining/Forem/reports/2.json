the bug**\r\n\r\nForem currently can't send email in production without a sendgrid api key (the sendgrid service dependency is set in config/environments/production.rb), but the .env_sample doesn't include SENDGRID_API_KEY which is set as the password.\r\n\r\nIdeally the outbound email service would be configurable, but in the meantime listing the required ENV var would help someone setting forem up on their own.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nReported initially in https://forem.dev/alvarolab/email-sending-is-not-working-1038, it seems like a small and useful fix.","closed_by":{"login":"djuber","id":1237369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzczNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1237369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber","html_url":"https://github.com/djuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/12977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/12977/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
