This causes a\r\nsituation where a missing broadcast message (by title) causes that\r\nnotification message to fail, and each day the same failure to\r\noccur (since it wasn't successfully sent the day before), blocking all\r\nfurther messages.\r\n\r\nWe want these to proceed on the schedule implicit in the checks, and\r\nfailing early prevents that.\r\n\r\nModify the error handling to catch RecordNotFound on each message, and\r\ncontinue throught the checks until a notification is enqueued or all\r\nchecks have been attempted.\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\npartial fix for https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/16059 (there's a data update script to create a broadcast needed as well).\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\nSet the user's created_at time to 6 days ago. Clear the user's notifications.\r\nRun the SendWelcomeNotificationWorker multiple times.\r\nIt's expected that the auth message fails, but subsequent notifications should be sent.\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Added/updated tests?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No, and this is why: hopefully this is what the existing tests expected to happen\r\n- [ ] I need help with writing tests\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be communicated?\r\n\r\n_Will this PR introduce a change that impacts Forem members or creators, the\r\ndevelopment process, or any of our internal teams?
