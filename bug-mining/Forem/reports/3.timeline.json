What type of PR is this? (check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Optimization\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe user moderation is expected to rescore (downward) all articles for a user when a vomit reaction is added. Additionally the articles should rescore upward when user moderation reactions are removed. This was disabled last year because it caused some unexpected problems (one users articles were clogging the feed for everyone after everything they had written was given the same, very high, score). The underlying cause was the score calculation, which assigned the same total to all articles.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic to process each articles score one by one when user moderation is being added or removed. Rather than setting all articles' scores to the sum of the reaction points for all articles, set the score equal to the sum of the reaction points of that one article plus the sum of the user reactions (from moderation). \r\n\r\nInitially I was going to just map a score adjustment (like score = score - 25)  against each of the articles, but realized that there were reasons this was the way it was initially. The main change now is breaking apart the article scoring to be per-article rather than a bulk update, which gains correctness (articles are correctly adjusted up or down) at the potential cost of many round trips to the database. I don't know _how_ frequently user moderation is happening to know if we need to worry about optimizing this as a special bulk query, this is already running in a background process when user vomit reactions are added or removed (which are moderator actions so not publicly available).\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/forem/forem/pull/9237\r\nhttps://github.com/forem/forem/pull/6006\r\nhttps://github.com/forem/forem/pull/6182\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/12965\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\n- As a moderator\r\n- add a vomit reaction to a user\r\n![moderator-flag-user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237369/110996932-485bfb80-8342-11eb-92d7-9f6c8269d065.png)\r\n\r\n- observe worker is started\r\n![sidekiq-logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237369/110997097-848f5c00-8342-11eb-83de-97067c0cee22.png)\r\n\r\n- verify user's articles' scores have adjusted downward\r\n![articles-scored](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237369/110997159-9e30a380-8342-11eb-9e4b-db4db105f636.png)\r\n\r\n- remove the vomit reaction from the user\r\nUI was unclear, but resubmitting the \"Flag user\" form does trigger the destroy action,  Response from server: {\"result\":\"destroy\",\"category\":\"vomit\"}\r\n\r\n- verify worker is started\r\n![sidekiq-logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237369/110997105-878a4c80-8342-11eb-8d81-4ff15c024a44.png)\r\n\r\n- verify the user's articles scores have adjusted upward (removing the negative feedback)\r\n![score-reset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237369/110997257-c5877080-8342-11eb-97ee-0321fa6b8b5a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Added tests?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n- [ ] No, and this is why: _please replace this line with details on why tests\r\n      have not been included_\r\n- [ ] I need help with writing tests\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be communicated?\r\n\r\n_Will this PR introduce a change that impacts Forem members or creators, the\r\ndevelopment process, or any of our internal teams?
