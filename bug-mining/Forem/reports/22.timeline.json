now the \"Home\" link in the main navigation is hardcoded so Admins can't customize or remove it.\r\n\r\nIt's been reported by admins several time that they would like to be able to do something about it. Hence this issue.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to:\r\n1. Remove [hardcoded Home link](https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/main/app/views/layouts/_main_nav.html.erb#L6-L11).\r\n2. Add it back as a dynamically created link in admin's _Navigation_ section `/admin/customization/navigation_links`, on the 1st position.\r\n3. Make sure freshly setup Forems come with that link being added/prepopulated in _Navigation_.\r\n\r\nEven though step 2 might seem weird (i.e. _adding what we've just removed?!_) it is the way to not harm those who still want it while at the same time leaving a door to edit/remove if anyone needs to.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**FYI**\r\n\r\n- We've recently [done similar thing for \"Signup\"

(check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Optimization\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis commit provides a possible solution for preventing the re-creation\r\nof a navigation link deleted by a Forem creator.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is a discussion around the life-cycle of the application\r\ninstallation and updates.\r\n\r\nIn particular, does this provide a robust enough mechanism for resolving\r\nthe issue at hand?\r\n\r\n_Note: it pains me to ask about a user's role, but this is provided as a\r\npoint of discussion and possible implementationi to address the\r\nunderlying issue.  But I'm referencing a constant in the Rake task so\r\nhopefully that will help future refactors.  Also, it's one reason I\r\nneeded to remove the `private_constant` declaration._\r\n\r\nIf we accept this code change, a future task is to document the ENV and\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\n### Further considerations\r\n\r\n- How might we refine this to not be as \"role\" reliant?\r\n- Could we have a Site::Setting that we enable/disable\r\n  regarding the navigation links?\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nCloses #15960\r\n\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\nHere's the steps I took.  Note the guard clause means there are several ways to create or skip creating.\r\n\r\n- Start from an empty database\r\n- Run setup\r\n- Verify Navigation Link exists\r\n- Delete Navigation Link\r\n- Run setup again\r\n- Verify Navigation Link exists (because we don't have a user)\r\n- Run seeds\r\n- Delete Navigation Link\r\n- Run setup again\r\n- Verify Navigation Link exists (because we don't have a user)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ cd ./path/to/forem/repo\r\n\r\n$ rails db:drop db:create db:schema:load\r\n\r\n$ bin/setup\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails runner \"puts NavigationLink.where(url: '/readinglist').exists?\"\r\n  => true\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails runner \"NavigationLink.where(url: '/readinglist').delete_all\"\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails runner \"puts NavigationLink.where(url: '/readinglist').exists?\"\r\n  => false\r\n\r\n$ bin/setup\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails runner \"puts NavigationLink.where(url: '/readinglist').exists?\"\r\n  => true\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails db:seed\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails runner \"NavigationLink.where(url: '/readinglist').delete_all\"\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails runner \"puts NavigationLink.where(url: '/readinglist').exists?\"\r\n  => false\r\n\r\n$ bin/setup\r\n\r\n$ bin/rails runner \"puts NavigationLink.where(url: '/readinglist').exists?\"c\r\n  => false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\n## Added/updated tests?\r\n\r\n- [x] No, and this is why: We don't have tests for these kind of things; they are a bit hard and slow to run.\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be communicated?\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR changes the Forem platform and our documentation needs to be\r\n      updated. I have filled out the\r\n      [Changes Requested](https://github.com/forem/admin-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=changes_requested.md)\r\n      issue template so Community Success can help update the Admin Docs\r\n      appropriately.\r\n- [x] I will share this change internally with the appropriate teams\r\n\r\n_Note: I have not updated the documentation as this is pending
