What type of PR is this? (check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Optimization\r\n- [x] Documentation Update\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, we were treating all NavigationLink attributes as\r\nunique.  So, were we to change a position of one of the NavigationLinks\r\nduring the add_navigation_links rake task, we would have created a new\r\nNavigationLink (and the only one would have remained).\r\n\r\nWith this commit, we're introducing the concept of the NavigationLink's\r\nsurrogate identity, that is to say if we have two NavigationLink objects\r\nwith the same `url` and `name` we should consider them the same\r\nNavigationLink.  This allows us to update properties of those\r\nNavigationLinks (via the rake task) without the risk of creating new\r\nentries.\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nThis unblocks PR #16268 which addresses #16076.\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\nThis further helps address some subtle edge cases in our navigation management.\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Added/updated tests?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be communicated?\r\n\r\n- [X] I will share this change internally with the appropriate teams\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5966050984,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBGPKJs5BlFZRzwAAAAFjmrao","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/events/5966050984","actor":{"login":"jeremyf","id":2130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0484c550c54050b96a54ac050b10a609eff321c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/commits/0484c550c54050b96a54ac050b10a609eff321c4","created_at":"2022-01-27T18:51:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5986719238,"node_id":"CE_lADOBGPKJs5BlFZRzwAAAAFk1hYG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/events/5986719238","actor":{"login":"aitchiss","id":20773163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzczMTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20773163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss","html_url":"https://github.com/aitchiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aitchiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-01T09:27:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6222648490,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBGPKJs5BlFZRzwAAAAFy5hSq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/events/6222648490","actor":{"login":"headline-design","id":85418370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDE4Mzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85418370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design","html_url":"https://github.com/headline-design","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/headline-design/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1467b61eb74e5812f0b1018ffefe9a58ed3fb2ee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/headline-design/forem-1/commits/1467b61eb74e5812f0b1018ffefe9a58ed3fb2ee","created_at":"2022-03-11T06:19:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
