(check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, if our community name included a `\"` we would\r\nencounter a parse error.  Using the [j][1] which is a terse alias for\r\n[escape_javascript][2], we will now be escaping those characters that\r\ncause grief in some of our parsings.\r\n\r\nI believe there is a larger audit that needs to occur regarding all\r\n`data-` renderings.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will catch a flakey test.\r\n\r\n[1]:https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavaScriptHelper.html#method-i-j\r\n[2]:https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavaScriptHelper.html#method-i-escape_javascript\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nCloses #16440\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\nSee if Travis breaks on these.\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\n## Added/updated tests?\r\n\r\n- [x] No, and this is why: Tests should start passing more regularly.  At a\r\n      minimum, if community names include `\"` they won't break.\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be communicated?\r\n\r\n- [x] I'm not sure how best to communicate this change and need help\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/comments/1031661501","html_url":"https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/16440#issuecomment-1031661501","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16440","id":1031661501,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBGPKJs49fee9","user":{"login":"jeremyf","id":2130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T16:26:35Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T16:26:35Z","body":"What do you mean \"not hydrating\" the user data?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/comments/1031661501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeremyf","id":2130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/comments/1031758119","html_url":"https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/16440#issuecomment-1031758119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16440","id":1031758119,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBGPKJs49f2En","user":{"login":"nickytonline","id":833231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzIzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/833231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline","html_url":"https://github.com/nickytonline","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickytonline/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-07T18:03:04Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T18:03:04Z","body":"> What do you mean \"not hydrating\" the user data?\r\n\r\nGot too fancy there.
