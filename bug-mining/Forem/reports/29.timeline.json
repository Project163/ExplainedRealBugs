What type of PR is this? (check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, we were assuming everyone still had the Listing's\r\nfeature turned on.\r\n\r\nWith this commit, we move from the \"implicitly on\" nature of\r\n`FeatureFlag.accessible?` to the \"explicitly off\" nature of\r\n`FeatureFlag.enabled?`.  The key differentiator is that we are not\r\n\"pushing out a feature flag setting to other forems.\"  Listings now\r\nbecome an \"opt-in\".\r\n\r\nThis requires a few things:\r\n\r\n1) Ensure that DEV.to enables the `:listing_feature` before we deploy\r\n   this branch.\r\n2) Communicate this change to other Forem adopters and provide a\r\n   timeline for when we'll deploy this change.\r\n3) Documentation.  Given that we have this feature, but it will be\r\n   disabled by default, we want to look into communicating what it is\r\n   and how to enable it.\r\n\r\nFurther, I chose to do the least effort change on our specs.  Namely to\r\ntreat the specs as though someone fully enabled the listing feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a \"competetor\" to #16423.\r\n\r\nCloses forem/rfcs#291\r\n\r\nRelates to #16420 and #16416.\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\nThe instructions of #16406 don't quite apply, but are similar:\r\n\r\nTesting this change:\r\n\r\n1.   Start your local application (e.g. $ bin/startup)\r\n2.   Go to http://localhost:3000/listings\r\n3.   You should get an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error; because the\r\n     application is now looking for a user or org named \"listings\"; in other\r\n     words we're not routing GET \"/listings\" to listings#index controller\r\n     action.\r\n4.   Now enable the feature (e.g. $ bin/rails r \\ \"FeatureFlag.enable(:listing_feature)\")\r\n5.   Refresh http://localhost:3000/listings\r\n6.   You should get a Successful response.\r\n8.   Now disable the feature (e.g. $ bin/rails r \\ \"FeatureFlag.disable(:listing_feature)\")\r\n8.   Refresh http://localhost:3000/listings\r\n9.   You should get an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error\r\n10.  Goto 4\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\n## Added/updated tests?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be communicated?\r\n\r\n- [x] I'm not sure how best to communicate this change and need help\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16437/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6027337237,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBGPKJs5DL6-2zwAAAAFnQd4V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/events/6027337237","actor":{"login":"jeremyf","id":2130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"637c2aaee7aab2478c637b4ee46296490c276934","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/commits/637c2aaee7aab2478c637b4ee46296490c276934","created_at":"2022-02-08T14:39:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jeremyf","id":2130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-08T14:42:13Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T14:42:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/16467","id":1127348280,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBGPKJs4yPYBK","number":16467,"title":"Ensuring

In the case of \"dev.to\" we enabling\r\nthe listing page.  In all other cases we're disabling the listing page.\r\n\r\nThis is a change that will require communication.  Namely, is this the\r\nright list of domains to explicitly enable?  But also, will we be\r\ndisabling something and creating a bit of surprise.\r\n\r\nAt a future point, we could move from an \"implicitly on\" to requires to\r\nbe explicitly on (e.g. via `FeatureFlag.enabled?`).  To turn it off will\r\nrequire some consideration in regards to the test suite.
