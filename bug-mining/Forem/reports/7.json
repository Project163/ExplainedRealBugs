Up until now I've just ignored it and let an entry go missing here or there.  Today I tried adding the entry manually, and found that it wouldn't let me save because my title was too long.\r\n\r\nI suspect these entries are getting missed because the title is too long so it can't get auto-saved into my dashboard.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Create an RSS feed with an entry with a very long title.\r\n2. refresh RSS\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAll RSS feed entries get draft posts.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS, version: Mac OS X Catalina\r\n- Browser, version: Firefox 89\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nOur RSS feed is https://www.opennms.com/feed/\r\n\r\nThe June 7th entry _(\"OpenNMS On the Horizon - Documentation, Flows and Nephron, Docker Container Trust, Thresholding, Metadata, Time-Series API, Minion Health Checks\")_ did not auto-import.","closed_by":{"login":"djuber","id":1237369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzczNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1237369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber","html_url":"https://github.com/djuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/13959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/13959/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
