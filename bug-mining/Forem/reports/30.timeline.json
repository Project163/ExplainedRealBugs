the bug**\r\n\r\nOriginally discovered on sandbox Forem but able to replicate on other Forems in the fleet.\r\n\r\nIf an Admin tries to delete a user's post (either by clicking **Delete** on the Manage page by appending `/manage` to the post URL or by clicking **Delete** on a Draft post in the User Dashboard), the `/delete_confirm` page 404s.\r\n\r\n@michael-tharrington confirms that he's able to replicate this issue.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nWhen logged in as Admin:\r\n\r\nEither\r\n1. Open the post you want to delete\r\n2. Append `/manage` to the post URL\r\n3. Click **Delete** to see `/delete_confirm` page and 404 error.\r\n\r\nOr\r\n1. Open the post you want to delete\r\n2. Click on the \"Mod Panel\" icon in the reactions bar (shield icon)\r\n3. Click on **Unpublish post** at the bottom of the Mod Panel\r\n4. Navigate to the User Dashboard (`/dashboard/username`)\r\n5. Locate the freshly unpublished post in **Draft** state\r\n6. Click **Delete** to see `/delete_confirm` page and 404 error.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI believe we previously saw a page asking to confirm if we wanted to delete the content, but it's tricky to recall now that we don't seem to be able to access this any more. \r\n\r\nIdeal world behaviour: a confirmation modal appears. When confirmed, Admin is returned to User Dashboard (to visually verify the post is deleted) with a notification that matches the style of those seen by Admins when banishing/deleting users, or unpublishing all of a user's posts.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n[I was recording a video tutorial when I first came across this, so here's the goofy video.](https://www.loom.com/share/b9e9ff128be2429895f838eb70aa1540) - enjoy

What type of PR is this? (check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit many of the policy methods were of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef create?\r\n  edit?\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above works, but introduces a place for code drift.\r\n\r\nWe can shorten this to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalias create? edit?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis helps keep the policy methods compact and scannable.  All things\r\nauthorization policy related should create narrow surface areas.  By\r\nhand-crafting methods, it is easier for \"slippage\" to occur.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of `alias` is it's use is reflected in API\r\ndocumentation.  With alias you need only write documentinig comments for\r\none method and the doc generators will relate the alias and the original\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nIf you \"hand craft\" a method using explicit delegation, the API\r\ndocumentation won't pick up that two methods are aliases.\r\n\r\nFurther, I believe we should be moving towards parity between the\r\nGET/POST/PUT methods that are related (e.g. the create/new pair and the\r\nupdate/edit pair).  This is not the case, as we \"silently\" suspend\r\nfolks.  As we move through the [authorization work][1], we will start\r\nhiding the links/buttons when a user can't take the action.\r\n\r\n[1]:https://github.com/orgs/forem/projects/46\r\n\r\n## Related

Here's what I think (and it's up for debate, as always):\r\n\r\n1. Super admins should be the ones who can turn on/off the comment-mode. The rationale being, It's a config affecting the whole site, and the current authorization rule is that only super admins can touch such configurations under `/config` (see more in [admin roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MUj3IsbK1g5Cf2NyUk_MAoz0SIYzROLQ8XNdsCPfrE/edit#heading=h.dc4dw8udn6yf)). Though we have decided to put the switch under a new page that is not `/config`, it still shares the same nature of configurations under `/config`. \r\n2. Both admins & super admins can publish articles. \r\n3. The rest of the types of admins are highly customized for DEV, such as tech admins & other single-resource admins (see the same doc about admin roles on \"General Rules\"), hence I don't think they'll exist in other Forems. In any case they happen to exist in other Forems, they shouldn't be able to publish posts.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the table would go: \r\n\r\nName | Recommendation\r\n-- | --\r\nadmin | Can post\r\ncodeland_admin | No!\r\nmod_relations_admin | No!\r\npodcast_admin | No!\r\nsingle_resource_admin | Hard No!\r\nsuper_admin | Can flip the switch & post\r\nsupport_admin | No!\r\ntech_admin |
