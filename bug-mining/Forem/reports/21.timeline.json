I assume when we render this we need to double that again (sending a sequence '\\\\\\\\' instead of '\\\\')\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capital lambda character (which has no special meaning) is not a problem, but the double backslash appears to break the handling of the user name (there are a few users with this pattern, each are unparseable and cause all follow buttons to be non-functioning).\r\n\r\n```\r\n> JSON.parse(\"{\\\"id\\\": 399496, \\\"className\\\": \\\"User\\\", \\\"style\\\": \\\"full\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"Λ\\\\: Olivier Revial\\\"}\")\r\nUncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : in JSON at position 64\r\n> JSON.parse(\"{\\\"id\\\": 399496, \\\"className\\\": \\\"User\\\", \\\"style\\\": \\\"full\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"\\\\: Olivier Revial\\\"}\")\r\nUncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : in JSON at position 63\r\n> JSON.parse(\"{\\\"id\\\": 399496, \\\"className\\\": \\\"User\\\", \\\"style\\\": \\\"full\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"\\\\\\\\: Olivier Revial\\\"}\")\r\n{ id: 399496, className: 'User', style: 'full', name: '\\\\: Olivier Revial' }\r\n  id: 399496,\r\n  className: 'User',\r\n  style: 'full',\r\n  name: '\\\\: Olivier Revial'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the database the user's name is just `'Λ\\: Olivier Revial'` - I think a good summary for this is \"users with slashes in the name break the follow button\" - it also happens on the user profile page - for example at https://dev.to/clementbosc \r\n\r\nThe linked issue was the same problem caused by a user with quote characters in their name, and the underlying issue appears to be the way we're embedding usernames in the data-info attribute is not json parse safe.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/comments/1003758605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djuber","id":1237369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzczNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1237369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber","html_url":"https://github.com/djuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/comments/1003767534","html_url":"https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/15916#issuecomment-1003767534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/15916","id":1003767534,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBGPKJs471Ebu","user":{"login":"djuber","id":1237369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzczNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1237369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber","html_url":"https://github.com/djuber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djuber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-02T20:02:25Z","updated_at":"2022-01-02T20:02:25Z","body":"related

What type of PR is this?

By rendering each hash attribute\r\nseparately, we were rendering characters that could break the\r\njavascript (e.g. double hack or backslash `\"` or `\\`).\r\n\r\nBy moving to this view_object rendering, we leverage Rails's `to_json`\r\nbehavior to ensure properly escaped values.  As part of this exercise, I\r\ngeneralized the method to allow for other places to benefit from this\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThis generalization also helps ensure that we have a more conformant\r\nrendering (e.g. we should always have an :id, :className, and :name\r\nvalue in our data-info hash).\r\n\r\n_Note: I've updated the user's names for Cypress tests as they are more\r\nlikely to catch the particular issue than anything else.

What type of PR is this? (check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n**This is a third attempt.  I'm pushing it up to see if anything's substantively changed.  I assume that there are broken specs and want to see what to address.**\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, we were somewhat naively rendering Hash style data\r\nattributes in our ERB templates.  By rendering each hash attribute\r\nseparately, we were rendering characters that could break the\r\njavascript (e.g. double hack or backslash `\"` or `\\`).\r\n\r\nBy moving to this view_object rendering, we leverage Rails's `to_json`\r\nbehavior to ensure properly escaped values.  As part of this exercise, I\r\ngeneralized the method to allow for other places to benefit from this\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThis generalization also helps ensure that we have a more conformant\r\nrendering (e.g. we should always have an :id, :className, and :name\r\nvalue in our data-info hash).\r\n\r\n_Note: I've updated the user's names for Cypress tests as they are more\r\nlikely to catch the particular issue than anything else.  I assume that\r\nI'm going to break some cypress tests and will need some help fixing\r\nthem._\r\n\r\nCloses #15916, #14704\r\n\r\nSupersedes #15983\r\n\r\nHow to test locally:\r\n\r\nAssuming you have seeded database (e.g. `rails db:seed`), checkout the\r\n\"main\" branch.  Then in `rails console` find a user that's written articles:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser = Article.last.user\r\n\r\nuser.update(name: \"\\\\: #{user.name} \\\"The Awesomest\\\"\")\r\n\r\nuser.articles.each(&:save)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, again on the \"main\" branch, start your application (e.g.,\r\n`bin/startup`).\r\n\r\nThen get a logged in and a logged out browser session going.  Open your\r\nweb inspector and open console.  Then go to the local instances homepage\r\n(e.g., http://localhost:3000) and look for JS errors.\r\n\r\nOn the main branch, you should see an exception around\r\n`JSON.parse(button.data.info)` (assuming that the `user`'s article is\r\nrendered on the homepage).\r\n\r\nThen go to the user's page (e.g. https://localhost:3000/:user-slug) and\r\nlook for JS parse errors.\r\n\r\nOn this PR's branch (e.g.,\r\n`jeremyf/take-two-at-resolving-gh-15916`)\r\nyou shouldn't see those console errors.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the Follow buttons should work.\r\n\r\nBut realistically, there are lots of places where these follow buttons show up,\r\nso consider that I updated the `./db/seeds.rb` and \r\n`./spec/support/seeds/seeds_e2e.rb` to include some of the scenarios we've found\r\nin the wild regarding usernames.\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\n## Added/updated tests?\r\n\r\n- [x] No, and this is why:\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be communicated?\r\n\r\n- [x] I will share this change internally with the appropriate teams\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16067/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jeremyf","id":2130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-12T16:23:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T16:23:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16078","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16078/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16078/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forem/forem/issues/16078/events","html_url":"https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/16078","id":1100537087,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBGPKJs4w3jAw","number":16078,"title":"Adding

What type of PR is this? (check all applicable)\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Documentation Update\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThroughout the code base we make use of a lot of polymorphic\r\nrelations (e.g. acts_as_follower, acts_as_taggable, etc.).  Which means\r\nwe often want to know the name of the relationship.\r\n\r\nFurthermore in our views and controllers we've often relied on using\r\n`object.class.name` for branching logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the sometimes transparent usage of the\r\nApplicationDecorator, we can get unexpected results.\r\n\r\nThis change is intended to help us move past the somewhat fragile method\r\nchain of `object.class.name`.\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nQuasi-related to #16067, #15916, #14704, and #15983.\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\nNone.  We shall look to our test suite.\r\n\r\n### UI accessibility concerns?\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Added/updated tests?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes\r\n\r\n## [Forem core team only] How will this change be
