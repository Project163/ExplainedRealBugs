Note,\r\ndepending on your local `.env` file (or configured ENV variables) you\r\nmay have a `GA_TRACKING_ID` value set; I did, it was set to \"Optional\"\r\nwhich overrode the database setting.\r\n\r\nWe set the HTML data properites in two places: [admin.html.erb][1] and\r\n[application.html.erb][2].\r\n\r\nIn addition, I'm short-circuiting the local fallback analytics call (via\r\n[Stacato][https://github.com/tpitale/staccato]).  My understanding of\r\nStacato, based on a cursory read, requires a Google Analytics Tracking\r\nID to work.\r\n\r\nAnd last, we have a one off of javascript for Google Analytics tracking.\r\n\r\n[1]:https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/528bd2baa608292f3e603c7a7587832a46cc791a/app/views/layouts/admin.html.erb#L31\r\n[2]:https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/528bd2baa608292f3e603c7a7587832a46cc791a/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb#L55\r\n\r\n## Related Tickets & Documents\r\n\r\nThis closes #15962.\r\n\r\n## QA Instructions, Screenshots, Recordings\r\n\r\n- Check your .env file to see if you have set GA_TRACKING_ID.  If so,\r\n  unset it.\r\n- Start with a fresh Forem instance.\r\n\r\n- Open your browser and open the developer tools to inspect the Network\r\n  activity.\r\n- Open the homepage of your local Forem instance (http://localhost:3000)\r\n- Filter your Network results for analytics.
