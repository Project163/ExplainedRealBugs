I only saw 7 articles created from those 10 entries, items with title lengths of up to 122 were permitted/created and entries with title lengths of 132, 143, and 144 were omitted/skipped.\r\n\r\n## Technical investigation (skip ahead if not interested)\r\n\r\n[Feeds::Import](https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/main/app/services/feeds/import.rb#L128-L168) handles errors in article creation by logging \r\n\r\n`result` here is the set of articles successfully created, `entries` is the parsed xml from the rss feed (I think there's some reverse chronological sorting between the two, one reads right to left and the other left to right, that's unimportant):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n[38] pry( <Feeds::Import>):2> result.map { |a| a.title.size }\r\n=> [122, 114, 22, 90, 96, 114, 87]                           \r\n[39] pry( <Feeds::Import>):2> entries.map {|e| e.title.size }\r\n=> [144, 87, 114, 96, 143, 90, 22, 114, 122, 132]     \r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking the logs after I called `create_articles_from_user_feed`, I see the error message is as you suspected  (article title is too long):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfeeds::import::error::ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid::{:feeds_import_info=>{:username=>\"admin_mcadmin\", :feed_url=>\"https://www.opennms.com/feed/\", :item_count=>10, :error=>\"Feeds::Import::CreateArticleError:https://www.opennms.com/en/blog/2021-06-07-opennms-on-the-horizon-documentation-flows-and-nephron-docker-container-trust-thresholding-metadata-time-series-api-minion-health-checks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=opennms-on-the-horizon-documentation-flows-and-nephron-docker-container-trust-thresholding-metadata-time-series-api-minion-health-checks\"}, :error_message=>\"Validation failed: Title is too long (maximum is 128 characters)\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a validation in the article code to ensure title is kept 128 characters or less.\r\n\r\n## Take-aways and ideas (stop skipping ahead now)\r\n\r\nI think there are a few possible solutions here to consider \r\n- Forem could permit longer article titles than 128 characters\r\n- a predictable truncation/shortening could be applied to rss entries with long titles during import to fit within the existing title length limit - for example grab up to 125 initial characters, and add an ellipsis, which we currently do shorten the visible description (if the size is greater than 100 characters, we add an ellipsis '...' to the initial content)\r\n-  add better messaging to users impacted by this during import - since you had to find this out through spot checking, and guessing about the problem, and it would be easier for us to let you know something went wrong, and what, so you can take appropriate actions. Right now we're sending that information to the logs, and not providing any notification to you. \r\n\r\nPutting on a \"design\" hat for the moment, since the article title is used in the card, exceeding a set maximum length might cause display problems. At 137 characters it wasn't a huge difference from shorter titles - at closer to 500 characters the card is noticeably larger than its peers.\r\n\r\n![A little longer looks normal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237369/121565549-26762180-c9e2-11eb-9417-ed27b0c30b61.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![much longer becomes imbalanced](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237369/121566383-127eef80-c9e3-11eb-9866-67ca25d7b2a6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe article's page (with the body content) also starts to have display quirks, with no visible text until you scroll past the long title header. I did not explore this on mobile, where the extra screen real estate used might have a larger impact. \r\n\r\nIf we decide to truncate the title to the draft post during import - it's probably \"straightforward\" to do that in the [Assemble Article Markdown](https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/625e7b01707accb1240b4649bd296481dd977de0/app/services/feeds/assemble_article_markdown.rb#L9) step, prior to creation - and let the user touch up the truncated title as needed when they edit to publish the post - the editor does enforce the limit and show errors if a post can't be saved.
