Pinky promise.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues.\n\n### Is this issue related to iced?\n\n- [x] My hardware is compatible and my graphics drivers are up-to-date.\n\n### What happened?\n\nIn iced version 0.13.1 (currently on crates.io), `Text.align_x()` doesn't work, it just does nothing.\nAfter having learned this, I switched to the git version of iced, where `align_x()` does work, sometimes.\n\nIt does work when the application first starts up. But during the application usage, the centering can quickly break for following reasons (and maybe more):\n\n- if the text to center contains a newline character, any resizing of the immediate container shifts the text right. So the text is still centered, but it's all the way on the right side of the container, even if the container was also set to center its contents.\n- if the text doesn't contain a newline character, then it sometimes behaves as if it was aligned left instead of centered. This seems to happen only in certain circumstances and I'm not sure when it works fine and when not, but I certainly experienced it not working.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nText that has the function `.align_x(Alignment::Center)` applied to it, should always have each individual line centered within its parent.\n\nWhen the text contains newlines, resizing the parent or adding other children to the parent should keep the text centered and in the middle of the centered parent instead of moving the text to the right.\n\n### Version\n\nmaster\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Do you have any log output?\n\n```shell\n\n```","closed_by":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
