I will not fill out this form just to ask a question or request a feature. Pinky promise.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues.\n\n### Is this issue related to iced?\n\n- [x] My hardware is compatible and my graphics drivers are up-to-date.\n\n### What happened?\n\nExperimenting a bit I noticed that the `cpu_brand` is always an empty string. Running the `system_information` example with `cargo r --package system_information` for example. On my machine looks like this:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/048afba6-30dd-4f96-a933-302fed35e98b)\n\nLooking at the implementation shows that [here](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/blob/master/winit/src/system.rs#L20) we fill out the `Information` struct like this:\n\n```rust\nuse sysinfo::{Process, System};\n    let mut system = System::new_all();\n    system.refresh_all();\n\n    let cpu = system.global_cpu_info();\n\n    // ...\n\n    Information {\n        // ...\n        cpu_brand: cpu.brand().into(),\n        // ...\n    }\n\n```\n\nReading the documentation for `System::global_cpu_info()` from [here](https://docs.rs/sysinfo/0.30.13/sysinfo/struct.System.html#method.global_cpu_info) it states:\n\n```md\n...\n⚠️ Important ⚠️\n\nInformation like [Cpu::brand](https://docs.rs/sysinfo/0.30.13/sysinfo/struct.Cpu.html#method.brand), \n[Cpu::vendor_id](https://docs.rs/sysinfo/0.30.13/sysinfo/struct.Cpu.html#method.vendor_id) or [Cpu::frequency]\n(https://docs.rs/sysinfo/0.30.13/sysinfo/struct.Cpu.html#method.frequency) are not set on the “global” CPU.\n```\n\nwhich would explain why the `cpu_brand` always shows an empty String.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\n`cpu_brand` not being an empty string.\n\n### Version\n\nmaster\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Do you have any log output?\n\n```shell\nN/A\n```","closed_by":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2794/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
