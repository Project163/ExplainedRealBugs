When I close the window by clicking on the close button, the application never ends, it just stays running in the background until I kill it manually (Ctrl+C in the terminal). I've added printlns around the iced::application call, and indeed, the \"after\" println never happens. Here's a screenshot to illustrate that. On the latest release (0.12.1) application terminates normally when the window is closed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2320ddd8-f8eb-42dc-a635-90f0c8247a8d)\r\n\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nI would expect the application to terminate when the window is closed.\n\n### Version\n\nmaster\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Do you have any log output?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
