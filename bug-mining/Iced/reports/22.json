It demands I hold down shift, even though there's no vertical scrollbal present (the scrollable is Horizontal, not Both, so it can only scroll in the one direction anyway). I don't believe I am able to change this behaviour.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nShift should be needed only when both scrollbars are present. Otherwise, scrollwheel should just scroll.\r\nAlternatively, I should be able to specify whether I want shift scrolling on a Horizontal scrollable.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n\r\ncrates.io release\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Do you have any log output?\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
