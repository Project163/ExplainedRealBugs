They're really not developed/looked at much.\r\n\r\nThe web does not implement this and that's been a problem for ages. Whenever you need to actually make a left/right moving menu, it creates a lot of friction, since web/app navigation is pretty much mouse only. Throwing in a shift key suddenly makes you stop moving when you expect to. Most people don't even know you can do that.\r\n\r\nHence why by now, everyone does little \"scroll buttons\" that jump x items left/right, and/or they manually implement swipe controls. You've probably seen them all round, the \"display 3 elements and swipe/press the arrow on the side to keep scrolling through the next ones\" is very common.\r\n\r\nFor my usecase, that really isn't good enough. I have a section of my app that is exclusively horizontally scrolled by design. I need to be fast and frictionless, and still usable without a hand on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nI don't think most people use horizontal scrolls much, so I don't think this would impact people negatively (if at all). For the few that do, it would make the standard of mouse-only navigation a lot smoother. Though if the need arises, at worst we should be able to choose whether we want the shift modifier (I myself don't see why you ever would).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/comments/2065444902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Gremious","id":21365711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzY1NzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21365711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious","html_url":"https://github.com/Gremious","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gremious/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12794996134,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC784y86EKf08zwAAAAL6pCWm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/events/12794996134","actor":{"login":"woelfman","id":1522167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman","html_url":"https://github.com/woelfman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woelfman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"41ef776d46aac50580035e865de55f87ceb6048b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/woelfman/iced/commits/41ef776d46aac50580035e865de55f87ceb6048b","created_at":"2024-05-14T02:16:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14174636348,"node_id":"REFE_lADOC784y86EKf08zwAAAANM38k8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/events/14174636348","actor":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0a0ea30059b86ca70951aff535c078c1c4b2af0e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/woelfman/iced/commits/0a0ea30059b86ca70951aff535c078c1c4b2af0e","created_at":"2024-09-08T17:04:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14174650641,"node_id":"CE_lADOC784y86EKf08zwAAAANM4AER","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/events/14174650641","actor":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-08T17:11:49Z","state_reason":null
