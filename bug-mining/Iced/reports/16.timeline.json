the maintainer of \"pretending the bug never happened, huh?\" even though it was fixed within 24 hours of your original issue being opened.\r\n\r\nI think if you want to label anything a \"random comment nearly a full year\" later as unprofessional, that's the comment you should point fingers at","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/comments/2594359557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"airstrike","id":152812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjgxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/152812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike","html_url":"https://github.com/airstrike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15950753740,"node_id":"MEE_lADOC784y86JhoUFzwAAAAO2vS_M","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/events/15950753740","actor":{"login":"bob448","id":74561828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTYxODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74561828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448","html_url":"https://github.com/bob448","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-16T02:47:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15950753747,"node_id":"SE_lADOC784y86JhoUFzwAAAAO2vS_T","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/events/15950753747","actor":{"login":"bob448","id":74561828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTYxODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74561828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448","html_url":"https://github.com/bob448","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bob448/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-16T02:47:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/comments/2594362737","html_url":"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/2447#issuecomment-2594362737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2447","id":2594362737,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC784y86aotVx","user":{"login":"imgurbot12","id":21094168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDk0MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21094168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12","html_url":"https://github.com/imgurbot12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-16T02:51:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T02:57:48Z","body":"Considering

only follow-up that was needed was that the issue was marked as completed with a commit which addressed it: https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/commit/d92e0f7bba8959384467048c7eca84b4b8a7195f\r\n\r\nThe example works in release here, both on Linux and Mac OS. No one else has reported this issue. You yourself said you had moved on. Why do you feel entitled to a response if you hadn't even bothered to try to run this in a year? I actually bothered to install a Debian VM just to make sure what I'm saying about reproducibility is an accurate statement to the best of my abilities.\r\n\r\n> Bob could've been more polite in the manner of his address but there is fault in the complete lack of communication and instead of admitting to anything @hecrj resorted to personal insults and ad-hominem.\r\n\r\nI find this bit fascinating. \"Bob could have been more polite?\" His comment was 100% a personal attack, except in a roundabout, passive-aggressive way, about an issue that literally does not exist. Expecting kindness after that is wild. It's like going into someone's house, trashing it and then wanting the host to be accommodating and understanding.\r\n\r\n\"Complete lack of communication\"? The issue was fixed in 24 hours! There's nothing further to discuss.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of admitting to anything\"? What is there to admit? Even if the issue still existed, don't you agree it's fairly easy to miss a reply in some issue that has already been closed. Look at how many issues, commits, and comments the project has. Have you never had someone forget to reply to you, miss a text, email, comment? If you really wanted an answer, why not follow-up yourself?\r\n\r\nNobody here has the *right* to be replied to, because that would imply someone else has an *obligation* to reply, which isn't the case. I think we all certainly strive to communicate as much as possible, but it's not an obligation.\r\n\r\nI encourage you to review why you think you're entitled to anything from a free project and why you think anyone throwing thoughtless accusations unsupported by any factual data—without doing any of the legwork to double check their assumptions—deserves anything other than a harsh response back by the people in charge of the project.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/comments/2594403918/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"airstrike","id":152812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjgxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/152812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike","html_url":"https://github.com/airstrike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/airstrike/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15950992610,"node_id":"MEE_lADOC784y86JhoUFzwAAAAO2wNTi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/events/15950992610","actor":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-16T03:29:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15950992616,"node_id":"SE_lADOC784y86JhoUFzwAAAAO2wNTo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/events/15950992616","actor":{"login":"hecrj","id":518289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/518289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj","html_url":"https://github.com/hecrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hecrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-16T03:29:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/comments/2594426255","html_url":"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/2447#issuecomment-2594426255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iced-rs/iced/issues/2447","id":2594426255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOC784y86ao82P","user":{"login":"imgurbot12","id":21094168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDk0MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21094168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12","html_url":"https://github.com/imgurbot12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imgurbot12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-16T03:57:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T03:57:34Z","body":"I
