Right now it will not pick up the active credentials automatically if run on an EC2 instance. DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain looks for Environment Variables, System Properties, and then Instance Profile data (set automatically on EC2 instances).\n\nIt's simple to implement your own AWSCredentiaProviderChain if you want to include the existing sources that you guys pull credentials from (configuration?).\n\nSee: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.java\n","closed_by":{"login":"nebhale","id":60754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale","html_url":"https://github.com/nebhale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nebhale/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-attic/aws-maven/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-attic/aws-maven/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
