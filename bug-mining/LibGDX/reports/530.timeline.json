merged without review, except that the PR takes slightly more of my time. Such PRs would have the text from the [commit messages](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commits/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/GlyphLayout.java). A PR does make sense when changes need review or to group multiple commits.\r\n\r\nFWIW, when GlyphLayout was added it was [via a PR](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/2955). Even with more elaborate commit messages or PRs, it's still going to take quite some effort to find, read, and make sense of them all, and after that GlyphLayout is still going to be pretty complex.\r\n\r\n> GlyphLayout for example is a beast, no human mind can keep track of that complexity!\r\n\r\nNah, it would just take a bit of effort for others to work on it. It's all right there, in the code! Look at all those nice comments! ;)\r\n\r\nIt is certainly easy to break, as there are so many edge cases. To really improve the situation it would need a lot of tests and others would still need to want to put in the effort needed to help maintain it. That may not be worthwhile, given it's a reasonably mature class and pretty widely used.\r\n\r\nThe recent changes fixed things that needed fixing, so even if they broke something with scaled fonts, it's likely better to debug the scaled fonts problem directly rather than find the change responsible.

Issue details\r\nHi all. \r\n\r\nThis is a related issue of https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6294\r\n\r\nWhen I have markup enabled, sometimes labels are wrapped incorrectly.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56004737/120535159-0a0e2f80-c3b9-11eb-8f1a-c308b3b4d256.png)\r\n\r\nNote that I tried to increase the `epslon` added by the fix in the related issue above (I tried values up to `10f`), but the wrapping issue still happens.\r\n\r\n(I changed the `epslon` using reflection.)\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n\r\nPlease check the example code here:\r\n\r\n[label-wrap-test.zip](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/6586718/label-wrap-test.zip)\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n\r\nI'm using libGDX 1.10.0.\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [X] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information,
