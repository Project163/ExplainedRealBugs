Run FreeTypeMetricsTest.\n   Save the generated output.\n2. Run FreeTypeMetricsTest again.\n   Save the generated output.\n3. Diff the outputs e.g using https://www.diffchecker.com/\n4. The diffs will be the same up to the 1139th(=1140) line. 1140 is exactly `bmp->rows * abs(bmp->pitch)`. The rest of the log (`bmp->rows * abs(bmp->pitch) * bmp->width`) is garbage.\n\nGdx Version is 1.9.1\nOS: Mac OS X El Capitan\n\nSee https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/8578f791a0f8d0813cc0b5381e897bd15e6dbb61#diff-cd2a8e6f2b978bfd546ad39168f00533R645\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
