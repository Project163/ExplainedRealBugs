isn't precisely the issue I was submitting for, although that's definitely a fix. It was more why you call Gdx.gl.glViewport when you resize. My thoughts was that forces you to use the glViewport specified when you use a stage. Could that call just be removed? Or at least made a function that could be overridden (like updateViewport)? I know that's a hack, but I like to use multiple stages and this glViewport call is causing havoc.

Since there isn't a way to resize a Stage without using the Viewport, it means if you have multiple stages then it becomes a question of fighting over glViewport between the glViewport you want and the ones the viewports are calling during a resize. \n\nI may be having problems because of this and the recent changes to the way that camera works now. Before I never had to do anything with glViewport because this was set when the app loaded, and then appeared to be updated in the engine before resize gets called, and all I had to do was update the Stages and my SpriteBatch to match the resize dimensions.

Camera A can be set to 1280x720 and Camera B can be set to 640x360. Then stage A would draw at the 1280x720 scale and stage B would draw at 640x360, correct?

Another perhaps better option is to have the rest of the update function encapsulated in a call something like updateCamera(). Then if scaling in ScalingViewport were protected (or you added a function called getScaling(screenWidth, ScreenHeight) ), then you could make your own custom viewport that behaves in ways that are more efficient when using Stages or drawing bitmaps in tandem with stages.\n\nI think there are many ways around the problem, but the current codebase doesn't support them.\n\nMy point is only that the current stage design eliminates hybrid implementations. My workflows usually implement UI elements with a Stage that is scaled to the dimensions of the window, but I have my own entities that do not use a stage (example: Box2D based objects) to render.

After you did that, you'd `update` them again, to set the \"usual\" glViewport.\n\nI cannot think of any scenario where you'd actually have several different viewports where they might anyhow interfere with each other.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/42740718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nooone","id":5896510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTY1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5896510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone","html_url":"https://github.com/nooone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/42742186","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1661#issuecomment-42742186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1661","id":42742186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzQyMTg2","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-10T13:48:17Z","updated_at":"2014-05-10T13:48:17Z","body":"> I understand that a Stage may not need the whole viewport, but why link a logical structure like the Stage to a display feature like glViewport?\n\nThe glViewport matters to stage because it affects how inputs are mapped from screen coordinates.

I just think that Stage\nshould be logical. You set the dimensions of the viewport and set the\nstages dimensions and positions and render to the camera (which is the old\nway), without regard to the actual OpenGL viewport.\n\nThe way the code is now, the stage is forced to be the size of the\nviewport, and there can only be one viewport.
