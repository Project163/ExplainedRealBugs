If the fields [`private final Actor[] pointerOverActors = new Actor[20];`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/bf32f0fbebeab7df0b0f257ea0fd3d9fbc549eff/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Stage.java#L75) or [`private @Null Actor mouseOverActor;`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/bf32f0fbebeab7df0b0f257ea0fd3d9fbc549eff/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Stage.java#L80) contain a reference to an `Actor`, those persist until the next call of [`Stage#act(float)`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/bf32f0fbebeab7df0b0f257ea0fd3d9fbc549eff/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Stage.java#L193-L227).\r\n\r\nI think `Stage#clear()` should set these fields to `null`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nContext: I had the problem that I called `Stage.dispose`, assuming that its children would get garbage-collected. However, that didn't happen as long as I kept a reference to the `Stage` itself. Only when I let go of the reference to the stage (or called `act()` one last time) did the memory the children used actually become available.","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
