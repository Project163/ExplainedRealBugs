Changing those two lines should fix it.\n\n@piotr-j you don't have to do Math.abs() on `c1.radius - c2.radius`, because you're using its squared value (the sign is removed anyway); you can also get rid of unnecessary `!` by inversing the inequalities and replacing `&&` by `||`.\n\nThanks for spotting the error, though; I don't use libGDX's math classes myself, so it's good that there are people checking them for validity.\n\nBTW, for reference:
