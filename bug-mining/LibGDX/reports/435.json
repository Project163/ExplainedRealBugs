But when I try to rename, for example, a file \"abc\" to \"ABC\", the file gets deleted. I think the problem is that file names are insensitve ( at least on Desktop, Windows). This is the implementation of the method mentioned above (I left commentaries in the code):\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void moveTo (FileHandle dest) {\r\n    if (type == FileType.Classpath) throw new GdxRuntimeException(\"Cannot move a classpath file: \" + file);\r\n    if (type == FileType.Internal) throw new GdxRuntimeException(\"Cannot move an internal file: \" + file);\r\n    copyTo(dest); // file is not copied into another file, since \"abc\" file  is the same as the dest \"ABC\" file\r\n    delete(); // and here the \"original\" file is deleted, but in this case original file equals to dest file, so the file is lost\r\n    if (exists() && isDirectory()) deleteDirectory();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**1)** Why there is no `rename `method in FileHandle? Why non-existing method mentioned in [libGDX Wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/File-handling#deleting-copying-renaming-and-moving-filesdirectories)?\r\n`Gdx.files.external(\"myexternalcopy.txt\").rename(\"mycopy.txt\");`\r\n**2)** Is it ok to do renaming like this (it works in this case, but maybe there are another caveats):\r\n```\r\nFileHandle src = Gdx.files.local(\"abc\");\r\nsrc.writeString(\"some string\", false);\r\nFileHandle dest = Gdx.files.local(\"ABC\");\r\nsrc.file().renameTo(dest.file());\r\n```\r\nIt works, even though the [docs of file() method](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/files/FileHandle.html#file--) say \r\n\r\n> Note the returned file will only be usable for Files.FileType.Absolute and Files.FileType.External file handles.\r\n\r\nwhich cunfuses me too.\r\n\r\n**3)** I think that `moveTo` method could first check, if src and dest are the same file, and in that case don't do anything (or just renaming), instead of deleting. \r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n```\r\npublic class MyGdxGame extends ApplicationAdapter {\r\n\r\n    FileHandle src;\r\n    FileHandle dest;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void create() {\r\n        src = Gdx.files.local(\"abc\");\r\n        src.writeString(\"some string\", false); // creates the file\r\n        dest = Gdx.files.local(\"ABC\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void render() {\r\n       //press enter\r\n        if (Gdx.input.isKeyJustPressed(Input.Keys.ENTER)) {\r\n            src.moveTo(dest); // deletes the file\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nI'm using LibGDX 1.9.7 right now, but I believe all versions have this issue.\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n- [x] MacOS\r\nAny platform with case-insensitive file system\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
