is pretty hard to follow. I think part of the issue has to do with the start and end nodes being non-walkable, maybe. It's hard to tell what coordinate offsets are in use because there's cases where identical names are used in different classes with no shared meaning, like how there's two `moveMap` arrays with different sizes. I printed this out of the JSON/TPMAP file; the origin is in the upper left, +1 x moves to the right, and +1 y moves down.\r\n\r\n```\r\n00000000000000000000\r\n00000000000001000000\r\n00000000000000100000\r\n00000100000000000000\r\n00000000000000001000\r\n00001100000000110100\r\n00001100011100110000\r\n00010000111000000000\r\n00000000011000000000\r\n00000000000000000000\r\n00001100000100110000\r\n00011100000000110000\r\n00000001000000000100\r\n00000010000000000000\r\n00000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the `getNode(int, int)` method is indexed starting at 1, because the nodes it gets show different positions than the x and y given to getNode(). If that's correct, then the start and end nodes are both `1`, non-walkable. But I'm really not confident enough to say what the start and end actually are, here.\r\n\r\nStill, a non-walkable end tile doesn't explain a Node being null inside BinaryHeap, especially if it worked before. I think I'll tinker with this a bit more, and see which positions cause an NPE.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/608203801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/608220855","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5986#issuecomment-608220855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5986","id":608220855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODIyMDg1NQ==","user":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-03T04:22:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T04:22:00Z","body":"Yes!
