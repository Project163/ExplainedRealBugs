Good catch, fixed!\r\n\r\nThe thing about start color is that it isn't configurable -- it is set in `begin()`. It would be odd to have `get/setStartColor` and then have whatever the user provided smoked in `begin()`. It may also be annoying to have to set the start color, rather than it using whatever the color is in `begin()` (though many times I have to set the current color (or scale, position, etc) before applying actions). A number of actions work by storing the current value as the \"start\" value in `begin()` and then don't expose the start value (eg

My comment was more oriented to the fact that start and end Color should be either both Colors instances or both be stored as their float components more than about the necessity of exposing the getter for the start color (haven't suggested having a setter). After some more thought, I think the argument for minimal memory allocation outweights the benefits of using Color instances and, imo, end Color should also be stored as its float components (maybe lazily created if `getEndColor()` is called)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/471189119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2191843114,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5MTg0MzExNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2191843114","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-09T15:27:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2191843115,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxOTE4NDMxMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2191843115","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-09T15:27:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13700425128,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAFH-b84Xyq73zwAAAAMwm-Wo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/13700425128","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f77b2d02a76d405a1695c30c38fe86c0abc3c6b5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tom-Ski/libgdx/commits/f77b2d02a76d405a1695c30c38fe86c0abc3c6b5","created_at":"2024-07-30T19:26:11Z","performed_via_github_app"
