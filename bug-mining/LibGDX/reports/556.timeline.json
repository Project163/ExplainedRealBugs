When disabled, you can ear a bit of left channel in right speaker and vice-versa. When enabled, channels are perfectly separated.\r\n\r\nThis option only applies to stereo sources and has no effect on mono sources. Note that with mono sources you can ear a bit of sound in left speaker even with pan at full right (and vice-versa) because of how OpenAL implement 3D audio.\r\n\r\nLwjgl2 backend doesn't have this option but both have the same behavior now.\r\n\r\nI improved the tests a bit in order to validate this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6527/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"hujasonx","id":4804682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4804682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx","html_url":"https://github.com/hujasonx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-29T04:19:19Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T04:19:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6784","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6784/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6784/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6784/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6784","id":1118024270,"node_id":"I_kwDOAFH-b85Co7JO","number":6784,"title":"Audio sounds muffled when using LWJGL3 backend","user":{"login":"hujasonx","id":4804682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4804682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx","html_url":"https://github.com/hujasonx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hujasonx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":11336980,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTMzNjk4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":null},{"id":172870364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzAzNjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/labels/need%20more%20info","name":"need more info","color":"cccccc","default":false,"description":"needs more info.

ensure you have given all the following requested information in your report.\r\n\r\n#### Issue details\r\nPlayed sound effects sound very strange / muffled when using LWJGL3 backend.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nThe bug can be reproduced on a nearly empty project:\r\n```\r\npublic class MyGdxGame extends ApplicationAdapter {\r\n\tSound testSound;\r\n\t\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void create () {\r\n\t\ttestSound = Gdx.audio.newSound(Gdx.files.internal(\"pistol2.wav\"));\r\n\t\ttestSound.play(1);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void dispose () {\r\n\t\ttestSound.dispose();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the above test, pistol2.wav is downloaded from https://freesound.org/people/michorvath/sounds/427592/ but I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter what file you use to repro.\r\n\r\n#### Version of libGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.10.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n* Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] macOS\r\n\r\n#### Other\r\nThe sound file I am playing is mono 16bit pcm Wav data at 44100hz. It also works fine on the lwjgl2 backend. I'd describe the audio distortion as as if it's being passed through a telephone or some sort of band pass filter.\r\n\r\nTo folks debugging: I wonder if this bug may have context / be related: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6526 - (also by chance the only other bug I have filed to this project - I tend to do a lot of audio stuff I guess)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6784/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12241266069,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAFH-b840eK-zzwAAAALZouWV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/12241266069","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1411ba03366387a086a41ad2d3414f2d61c42198","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/VaTTeRGeR/libgdx/commits/1411ba03366387a086a41ad2d3414f2d61c42198","created_at":"2024-03-25T21:53:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
