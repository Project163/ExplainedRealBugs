What do you mean by `of infinity time with timeout` ? If you give an infinite amount of time to attempt to make a connection, I think it will attempt to connect until the internet is enabled again, and it can make the request. The console here is the JavaScript console in the browser, right? That would explain why it doesn't give a typical Java stacktrace. I know @MrStahlfelge is great with GWT, but I don't know how much networking he does with GWT.
