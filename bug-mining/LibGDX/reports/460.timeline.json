I guess the reason behind this is to have maximum IDE compatibility but it'd be great to get some details on that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, support v4 must be set up to the latest 25 version (it needs to be as high as possible but less than 26 as long as we support minSDK < 14).\r\n\r\nThere is a support -v4 v19 Jar inside the libs folder of the Android backend that is loaded as a dependency on its pom.xml. I believe the reason it can't be updated to v25 is that its packaging was changed to AAR which is Maven doesn't understand (unless using 3rd party plugin). I don't know either why this jar must be embedded in the libGDX project and can't be added as remote dependencies on the Pom.\r\n\r\nSo yep, there are 2 versions of Android support-v4 (v19 loaded via Maven and v25 via Gradle) and it complains when trying to run the tests.\r\n\r\n@Tom-Ski Can you give us some insights on this?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/407251267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1749048079,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc0OTA0ODA3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1749048079","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-24T01:32:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1749048080,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NDkwNDgwODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1749048080","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-24T01:32:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/407441203","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5269#issuecomment-407441203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5269","id":407441203,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNzQ0MTIwMw==","user":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-24T15:07:50Z","updated_at":"2018-07-24T15:09:23Z","body":"Its

I understand that we officially build libGDX with Maven and we need to build Android but on the other hand there's no official support for Maven on Android which complicates things.\r\n\r\n2. I've checked the contents of the 25.4.0 AAR (latest 25+ available) and it does not contain any resources so in theory we could take the .jar inside and embed it. A bit too hacky for my taste though.\r\n\r\nIf I've understood this correctly we are on the edge now and this leads inevitably to problems building libGDX in the long run when Google comes up with new stuff that is unsupported by Maven. \r\n\r\nWhat options are there? Would it be feasible to keep Maven as the build system but delegating to a Gradle task building the Android stuff? Would it make sense to migrate the build to Gradle in the future?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/407463230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1750591227,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc1MDU5MTIyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1750591227","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-24T16:11:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1750591228,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NTA1OTEyMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1750591228","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-24T16:11:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1778263447,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc3ODI2MzQ0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1778263447","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"65fd2fe17115710c035793e7605c69847e54d8bc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/65fd2fe17115710c035793e7605c69847e54d8bc","created_at":"2018-08-08T16:51:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/41
