Anyway, while checking out the tests I came over a small bug in ReflectionTest, where it threw an exception with the following message:\n\n```\nFAILED: Method not found: mul, for class: com.badlogic.gdx.math.Vector2 [...]\n```\n\nIt's probably just because of refactoring, but anyway, I found that if I replaced the second parameter on line 57 from \"mul\" to \"scl\":\n\n```\nMethod mMul = ClassReflection.getMethod(Vector2.class, \"scl\", float.class);\n```\n\nIt would run as intended :)\n\nThanks.
