Example:\n\n``` java\nval textFieldStyle = TextField.TextFieldStyle(\n        font, Color.WHITE,\n        TextureRegionDrawable(TextureRegion(Texture(\"caret.png\"))),\n        TextureRegionDrawable(TextureRegion(Texture(\"caret.png\"))),\n        NinePatchDrawable(NinePatch(Texture(\"textField.png\"), 30, 30, 2, 2))\n)\nskin.add(\"default\", textFieldStyle)\nval textField = TextField(\"This is some text...\", skin)\ntable.add(textField).center().row()\n```\n\nWith that code, your textfield will have a 30px left and right \"margin\". When you click on the text inside the `TextField`, the caret won't be positioned where you clicked, but 30px to the right. Selections are also obviously affected.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
