is not paused / muted when window is deactivate / minimized on desktop application. It is a general requirement that the game should pause / mute the audio when minimized. \n\nLooks like a bug, but I found no code for that LwjglApplication, so it could be intentional. No flags in LwjglApplicationConfiguration seems to be responsible for that. The same behavior was noticed in #1263 but was not answered.\n\nMinimal example (the music keeps playing disregarding the window state):\n\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        final LwjglApplicationConfiguration cfg = new LwjglApplicationConfiguration();\n\n        new LwjglApplication(new ApplicationAdapter()\n        {\n            Music music;\n\n            @Override\n            public void create()\n            {\n                music = Gdx.audio.newMusic(Gdx.files.internal(\"audio/music_01.mp3\"));\n                music.play();\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void dispose()\n            {\n                music.dispose();\n            }\n        }, cfg);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
