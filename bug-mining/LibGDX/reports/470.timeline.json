It will act the same as if they were in libGDX's such file; the GWT compiler merges all `.gwt.xml` files. This is likely to be the most reasonable fix since you can do it today without waiting for a new release. Adding subclasses I am fairly sure will also add their parent classes to the reflection cache, but you can do it manually for all classes you know have been mentioned in a `Couldn't find Type for class ...` error. The reflection cache can get too big to compile if there are too many classes added to it (and that's not the same as `extend-configuration-property` lines), so the `gdx.gwt.xml` file is only enlarged if a class is important to most applications on GWT, I think.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/448909223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2068912414,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwNjg5MTI0MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2068912414","actor":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c0e89a5c1f258b41455c146471988ae5d2b1edd7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mgsx-dev/libgdx/commits/c0e89a5c1f258b41455c146471988ae5d2b1edd7","created_at":"2019-01-11T16:01:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2069561119,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwNjk1NjExMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2069561119","actor":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dd6044afa82ff9331663117e1c1cbea013209587","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mgsx-dev/libgdx/commits/dd6044afa82ff9331663117e1c1cbea013209587","created_at":"2019-01-11T21:16:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2075436716,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA3NTQzNjcxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2075436716","actor":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDev
