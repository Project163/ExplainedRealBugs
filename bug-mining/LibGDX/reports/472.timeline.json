i'm not sure about your proposal : a pool just abstract object creation, nothing more. Start should be called for non pooled effects in user code and it should be the same for poolled effects.\r\n\r\nThere is some use cases when you don't want polled effects to be automatically started (same use cases as non pooled effects) : you prepare a bunch of effets, position them and start them with some delay (like fireworks).\r\n\r\nIMO wiki pooled effect examples have to be fixed in this way. It's not a \"ugly solution\", it's  how particle effects have to be used.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/466376343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2157689815,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE1NzY4OTgxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2157689815","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-22T12:11:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2157689816,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNTc2ODk4MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2157689816","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-22T12:11:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/466385251","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5571#issuecomment-466385251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5571","id":466385251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjM4NTI1MQ==","user":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-22T12:47:45Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T14:38:46Z","body":"@mgsx-dev
