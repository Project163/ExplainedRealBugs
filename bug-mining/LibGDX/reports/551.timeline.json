fixes #6347 ; big thanks to @tomcashman for making the affected code so easy to spot.\r\n\r\nIn case what this does isn't obvious, IntMap and LongMap correctly check for whether their Values iterators are currently iterating through the \"zero value,\" which is not in the regular array. When iterating over the value for a key that is zero, the iterator is at position `INDEX_ZERO`, which is -1. While IntMap.Values and LongMap.Values don't try to look up INDEX_ZERO in their value table, IntIntMap.Values and IntFloatMap.Values do, which currently causes an index out of bounds exception in 1.9.13. This makes IntIntMap and IntFloatMap match IntMap's correct behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6348/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4174132180,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE3NDEzMjE4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/4174132180","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-06T08:41:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4174132371,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxNzQxMzIzNzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/4174132371","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"78272cd6d5e9ef84dc511dc917bd54f1eeb289e2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/78272cd6d5e9ef84dc511dc917bd54f1eeb289e2","created_at":"2021-01-06T08:41:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/755197565","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6347#issuecomment-755197565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6347","id":755197565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTE5NzU2NQ==","user":{"login":"tomcashman","id":1745420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDU0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1745420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman","html_url":"https://github.com/tomcashman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomcashman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-06T09:47:52Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T09:47:52Z","body":"Thanks

Improve MathUtils.asin(), acos()\r\n\r\nThe average and largest error are significantly better for this version (2-3 orders of magnitude), and it can be slightly faster.\r\n\r\n* Fix missing check for INDEX_ZERO in IntIntMap, IntFloatMap.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #6347 . Thanks @tomcashman , for making this an easy fix!\r\n\r\n* Mark key/value/entry/iterator fields as transient.\r\n\r\nThis stops a bad StackOverflowException from happening when some Map or Set types are iterated over and then written with Json. That happens in all stable versions I've tried between 1.9.6 and 1.9.13, on at least IntIntMap but probably also IntFloatMap and ObjectLongMap.\r\n\r\nA better alternative would be to add special-case Json handling like IntMap, ObjectIntMap, and LongMap have for the other primitive-backed maps, since that would make the output much cleaner, smaller, and more readable. At one point, the special-case handling I wrote was in my PR that introduced these updated data structrures, but adding that was overruled, and the serialization code was removed without `transient` being added in its place to fields that cause problems during \"vanilla\" serialization.\r\n\r\n* Fix getIndices() crash in Mesh, credit to Agueliethun\r\n\r\nThis was probably a copy/paste error, but the getIndices() code mistakenly changed the vertices buffer where it formerly changed only the indices buffer. This caused crashes in ModelCacheTest when the Cache checkbox was selected and any model was added.\r\n\r\n* First, the test that shows an issue...\r\n\r\nThanks to Discord user vladimir for finding a remaining part of an issue with IntMap and LongMap, this time in the iterator() of their Values (maybe also Keys) when using remove() . Here, the sizes aren't as expected after over 9K items have been placed (actualSize is 9282 when the problem happens, but the correct value is 9283).\r\n\r\n* In IntMap/LongMap, null out zeroValue when it is removed.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be relevant to the return value when you `put(0, something)` after that 0-key has already been put and removed. I think this fixes vladimir's bug with the Values iterator().","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adhithiyan/libgdx/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adhithiyan/libgdx/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4688324456,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2ODgzMjQ0NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/4688324456","actor":{"login":"crykn","id":8125827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjU4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8125827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn","html_url":"https://github.com/crykn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"388590e22e0f5f0304e4ce5bd1ffe1813577b430","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/388590e22e0f5f0304e4ce5bd1ffe1813577b430","created_at":"2021-05-05T11:09:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
