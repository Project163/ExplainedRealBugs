Example:\n\n``` java\npublic static class X { public String s; public X() {}; }\n\nX x1 = new X();\nx1.s = \"123\";\nString jsonString = new Json().toJson(x1); // {s:123}\nX x2 = new Json().fromJson(X.class, jsonString); // x2.s has value \"123.0\"\n```\n\nThe value of x2.s is now \"123.0\", when it should be \"123\". The same problem happens for very large numbers like \"1234567890123456789012\" which gets converted to \"1.2345678901234568e+21\", which is very problematic as many services use such strings as identifiers.\n\nOne solution is to call setOutputType(JsonWriter.OutputType.javascript), but this is a workaround not a solution, and prevents other optimizations as well.\n\nThe ideal solution would be to change the JsonWriter.OutputType.quoteValue() method to also quote numerical strings. Since JsonWriter.OutputType is an enum not a class, it cannot be extended or customized without changing the LibGDX source code.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
