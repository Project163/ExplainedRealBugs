If I override getter as\n\n@Override\n    public boolean isDisabled()\n    {\n        return super.isDisabled() || (subMenu == null && clickHandler == null);\n    }\n\nThat does not work because Button class uses directly variable. Which breaks inheritance idea. I bet other class/variables are affected too.\n\nSo to workaround I must go as:\n boolean dis = super.isDisabled();\n            setDisabled(isDisabled());\n            super.draw(batch, parentAlpha);\n            setDisabled(dis);\n\nAny way, such things must be fixed. Class should not read variables directly if getter is exposed because it can be overrided Or mark it final.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
