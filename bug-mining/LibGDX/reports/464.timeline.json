It seems this commit checks non-touchable actors:\r\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/d139e851106b2e094a97443f84638c9864a10212\r\nI assume this is because drag targets may not normally be touchable, but I don't remember (6 years ago!). I'm not sure we want to change the default behavior. We could make a setting so non-touchable actors aren't checked. You could subclass your drag actors so `hit` always returns null. You could offset the drag actors so it's hard/impossible to hit them with the mouse.

ensure you have given all the following requested information in your report.\r\n\r\n#### Issue details\r\nDue to a change between 1.9.8 and 1.9.9 in the DragAndDrop class (actual change is here: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/gdx-parent-1.9.9/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/utils/DragAndDrop.java#L75) the updated version causes the `dragStop` to be called while still in `drag`. Using a watch on the payload I was able to trace it through a cascade of `dragActor.remove` -> `parent.removeActor` -> `stage.unfocus` -> `cancelTouchFocus` -> ... some event classes in between ... -> `listener.dragStop` (the one inside `DragAndDrop.addSource`). This sequence of events causes payload to be reset and thus causes an NPE at line 105 (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/gdx-parent-1.9.9/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/utils/DragAndDrop.java#L105)\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nJust implement the DragAndDrop and it should happen as soon as you start dragging.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nLibGDX: 1.9.9+ \r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n```java\r\nException in thread \"LWJGL Application\" java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.utils.DragAndDrop$1.drag(DragAndDrop.java:105)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.utils.DragListener.touchDragged(DragListener.java:61)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.InputListener.handle(InputListener.java:62)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Stage.touchDragged(Stage.java:314)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglInput.processEvents(LwjglInput.java:345)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication.mainLoop(LwjglApplication.java:217)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication$1.run(LwjglApplication.java:126)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [X] Android\r\n- [X] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [X] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [X] HTML/GWT\r\n- [X] Windows\r\n- [X] Linux\r\n- [X] MacOS\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5675/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3271952768,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyNzE5NTI3Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3271952768","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a6de2d5244cca22f43701ee9c2094badca4574c6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/a6de2d5244cca22f43701ee9c2094badca4574c6","created_at":"2020-04-25T14:08:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13700424594,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAFH-b84WDtsMzwAAAAMwm-OS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/13700424594","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"df1ed3f4eca8f816f3e63e9f22f191f155c1baa5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tom-Ski/libgdx/commits/df1ed3f4eca8f816f3e63e9f22f191f155c1baa5","created_at":"2024-07-30T19:26:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
