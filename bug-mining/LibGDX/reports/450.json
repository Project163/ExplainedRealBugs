What this means is that All particles emitted at one time will have the same Life. This limitation doesn't allow simple effects such an explosion in which not all particles live the same.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Wiki:\r\n\r\n>Life: How long a single particle will live.\r\n\r\n>Life Offset: How much life is used up when a particle spawns. The particle is still moved/rotated/etc for the portion of its life that is used up. This allows particles to spawn, eg, halfway through their life.\r\n\r\nIt could be that the way the Life attribute behaves atm is useful for some type of effect but as a user I miss a Life attribute that affects each particle individually.\r\n\r\n**Whether we need a new Life attriubute or fix the existing one I will happily work on a PR.**\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nVideo showing the issue, observe that when life value is modified to be Ranged, all particles have the same Life.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/IXOgCgAUmk8\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.8\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
