example).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/695812488/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3786256631,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc4NjI1NjYzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3786256631","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-20T17:19:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3786256632,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3ODYyNTY2MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3786256632","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-20T17:19:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3786256633,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc4NjI1NjYzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3786256633","actor":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-20T17:19:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3786256634,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVud

For sure not, and I don't understand why you suppose that.\r\n\r\n@MrStahlfelge No worries, just that you asked a question when it seemed you know the answer already. Whether a slider is vertical is a property of the slider, not an implementation detail. Slider has a public isVertical getter. An implementation detail would be something like making `calculatePositionAndValue` public API  (protected or public access). That is used internally and doesn't need to be public API. Making it so exposes class internals, increasing the public API surface and making it more difficult to change the class if needed. It can make sense to expose things in the public API, but it should be done carefully and purposefully, not just by making all the fields public/protected access.\r\n\r\n> I've found some limitations when trying to create my own widgets by extending Scene2D classes, not that much because of private modifiers but because of default/package modifiers.\r\n\r\nDefault access is not public API, so can be used within a library without exposing internals, just like private. Using the same package in app code is a workaround, though it comes with an increased risk of breakage since you can access things that were not intended to be used outside the library.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the need to muck around in a library's internals to get something done, I contend it would not be an improvement to expose all or most fields throughout libgdx as public API (public or protected access). If someone wants full access to everything in scene2d.ui widgets, copying the whole thing into app code is reasonable. In other areas of libgdx that is not possible (or would otherwise mean forking the entire library). In those situations the use cases should be considered individually and APIs exposed only as needed.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/695818183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3786294922,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc4NjI5NDkyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3786294922","actor":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-20T18:14:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3786294925,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3ODYyOTQ5MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3786294925","actor":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-20T18:14:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/696026192","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6189#issuecomment-696026192","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6189","id":696026192,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjAyNjE5Mg==","user":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_event

Well, Slider does extend ProgressBar, which exposes an isVertical accessor\r\n\r\nI was not aware that it was added because of #4680, I used it as an example because this was one of my biggest

Me, I don't see anything being`protected` as `public`. I don't think that changing protected stuff is API breakage.

I am not a Kotlin fanboy, but I think they were right about removing package-private access completely for that language.\r\n\r\nI can follow your reasoning that it is possible to copy the code of widgets, it looks like we are just have different views on this, too.
