I have a character that moves using one finger of the left hand and the pan gesture, holding down that finger so that the character follows the finger movements. This character fires touching the screen with another finger, from the right hand for example, but when I do this the listener stops detecting the pan so I can't move the character while he's shooting. I was planning to use fling to change weapons but I can't do it while moving again.\n\nI was hoping that maybe it would be interesting to detect several gestures at the same time but in this specific case I think I will deal with the problem with my own code over a simple InputProcessor.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/35167681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/35168306","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1349#issuecomment-35168306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1349","id":35168306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTY4MzA2","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-15T21:25:22Z","updated_at":"2014-02-15T21:25:22Z","body":"Maybe you can only feed the GestureDetector the events that it needs to see.
