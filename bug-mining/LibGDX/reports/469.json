I noticed however that the second request is not issued, until the first one completes. I would like for these HTTP calls to be made in parallel._Please provide the details of your issue_\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking in the code, the `NetJavaImpl`  uses an `new AsyncExecutor(1);`, where 1 is the max concurrent requests. I would like to increase this (ie. to 2 or 3), however it doesn't seem to be possible since it is hard coded to 1.\r\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/net/NetJavaImpl.java#L127\r\nWhat would you recommend in order to make it possible to shoot multiple parallel HTTP requests to the server?\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.6\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x] Android\r\n- [x] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
