still see this issue with the latest nightlies.\n\nHere's a bare-bones example which illustrates the problem.\n\n``` java\npublic class FixedWidthGlyphTest extends ApplicationAdapter {\n    SpriteBatch batch;\n    BitmapFont font;\n    BitmapFontCache fontCache;\n    float counter;\n\n    @Override\n    public void create () {\n        batch = new SpriteBatch();\n\n        font = new

() {\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 1);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n\n        counter += Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime() * 10;\n        String text =

glyphs used are set to have a fixed width. However, as shown in the log, the width of text with the same number of characters varies. This causes the text to appear to move around.\n\nThe width, and therefore the position, of the text depends on the width of the last character, which is variable despite the call to setFixedWidthGlyphs(). The width of the first character is also variable so a similar effect would be seen if the text were left-aligned.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/117374392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hyvas","id":2769000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjkwMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2769000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas","html_url":"https://github.com/hyvas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":344826694,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQzNDQ4MjY2OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/344826694","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-07-01T00:26:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/118387204","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3239#issuecomment-118387204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3239","id":118387204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODM4NzIwNA==","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-03T16:28:28Z","updated_at":"2015-07-03T16:28:28Z","body":"Thanks.\n\nThe problem is in BitmapFont `getGlyphs`. Here is a \"fix\":\n\n```\npublic void getGlyphs (GlyphRun run, CharSequence str, int start, int end) {\n    boolean markupEnabled = this.markupEnabled;\n    float scaleX = this.scaleX;\n    Array<Glyph> glyphs = run.glyphs;\n    FloatArray xAdvances = run.xAdvances;\n\n    Glyph lastGlyph = null;\n    while (start < end) {\n        char ch = str.charAt(start++);\n        Glyph glyph = getGlyph(ch);\n        if (glyph == null) continue;\n        glyphs.add(glyph);\n\n        if (lastGlyph == null)\n            xAdvances.add(0); // First glyph. // This changed!\n        else\n            xAdvances.add((lastGlyph.xadvance + lastGlyph.getKerning(ch)) * scaleX);\n        lastGlyph = glyph;\n\n        // \"[[\" is an escaped left square bracket, skip second character.\n        if (markupEnabled && ch == '[' && start < end && str.charAt(start) == '[') start++;\n    }\n    if (lastGlyph != null) xAdvances.add(lastGlyph.xadvance * scaleX - padRight); // This changed!\n}\n```\n\nSee the two lines noted. Those lines (before being fixed as above) made the first glyph flush with the left edge and made the last xadvance flush with the right edge. This is nice for variable width fonts because it gives tight fitting bounds for the glyphs. For a fixed width font, it is not so good because you lose the fixed width for the first and last glyph, as you found.\n\nI'm not sure what the fix is. BitmapFont `getGlyphs` is intended for customization by subclasses, eg to combine multiple characters into a single glyph. Needing to copy/paste it for a fixed width font isn't good. Adding a font field `boolean fixedWidth` is also not good, since it adds a special case that needs to be handled in ever `getGlyphs` implementation. It may be the only way though.\n\nThoughts?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/118387204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":347516871,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0NzUxNjg3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/347516871","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8ca4a9a96723a014c6bdd1b3757bc1c5af64fed0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/8ca4a9a96723a014c6bdd1b3757bc1c5af64fed0","created_at":"2015-07-03T16:28:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":null,"created_at":"2015-08-26T20:50:13Z","updated_at":"2015-08-26T20:50:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3378","id":103361016,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMDMzNjEwMTY=","number":3378,"title":"Character

Tested in libgdx 1.6.5 on OS X 10.10.5.\n\nThe basic idea is that when using color markup in scene2d labels, the character immediately following the \"pop color\" control code, `[]`, either doesn't have its width set correctly, or is not offset the correct amount from the character before the control code. The problem isn't confined to fonts with fixed width glyphs specified, but it does help illustrate it better.\n\nThe above code run with the call to `font.setFixedWidthGlyphs` commented out: Small but noticeable difference. This difference is more pronounced on monospace fonts (even with no fixed width glyphs specified).\n\n<img width=\"512\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6292811/9505635/d7a791a0-4c43-11e5-8a89-7370ac17af11.png\">\n\nWith the call uncommented:\n<img width=\"512\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6292811/9505672/132425a4-4c44-11e5-8e87-616fde909d74.png\">\n\nNote:\n1. How more pronounced the effect is the more `[]` controls are in the string, and\n2. The amount of space between the last 't' and the first period on each line.\n\nThis may or may not be related to #3239, but my hunch is it's a different subtle bug somewhere else in the glyph width calculation

Please, notice some strange artifacts in some characters (especially 'F', '5', '6'). The same thing without setting the width is below -- as you can see, all characters there are rendered correctly. Btw the font is 32px size and pregenerated with FreeTypeFontGenerator.\n\nPlease, click on the image to see it in full size.\n\n![label_artifacts1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10563821/10561589/6325fcb8-7538-11e5-81cf-3f3c6d2040ce.png)\n\nAnother example is with a TextButton and its Label.

very much for the investigation and explanation, and apologies for the delay in replying.\n\nThe updated `getGlyphs` works for me. I see what you mean about the difficulty of a fix. Since `setFixedWidthGlyphs` takes a list of glyphs rather than fixed width being applied to the whole font, a `boolean fixedWidth` field in `Glyph` seems to make most sense. Also better to have to deal with a special case in a custom `getGlyphs` implementation than the more common case of using `setFixedWidthGlyphs`. See what you think of the pull request.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/156810583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hyvas","id":2769000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjkwMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2769000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas","html_url":"https://github.com/hyvas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyvas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/158907572","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3239#issuecomment-158907572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3239","id":158907572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1ODkwNzU3Mg==","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-23T11:16:46Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T11:16:46Z","body":"Closed
