The issue seems to happen on Labels that use a scaled font with markup enabled and wrapping enabled as well. In some cases the Label wraps an extra line and doesn't update it's own size causing layouts that are dynamic depending on the size of the Label not to adapt correctly. This issue was not occuring on 1.9.11.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue you can use the following code:\r\nhttps://paste.ofcode.org/zBZzt6cxS74MnbjkSDhLzK\r\n\r\n![fontissue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1794492/100490980-8715cf00-3120-11eb-8518-b9cf1184e433.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n@NathanSweet I've noticed recent changes on GlyphLayout related to markup and wrapping, this may be related.","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
