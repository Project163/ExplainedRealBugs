Game Controllers are hidden to sites until a button is pressed, then all connected controllers are shown. Also, Chrome always updates the timestamps on the controllers, even if no interaction was done.\r\n\r\nIt is very helpful to reproduce these different behaviours on www.html5gamepad.com because this is probably causing the game controller problems on Chrome.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n1. Open Chrome, don't press any button on the game controller\r\n2. Start the libgdx game with controller support\r\n3. Press a button. The connect method fires for the controllers (good), but the button used for unhiding the controllers to the game is \"hanging\" (this is a problem). A solution is to reload the game. Then controllers work as intended.\r\n4. Furthermore, if the user has more than one controller connected and changes the tab on Chrome and then returns to the game, some controllers are doubled in the list of connected controllers and connect method fires. These doubled controllers do not react on events any more. This is not solvable with reloading, Chrome has to be restarted.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\ngdx-controllers-1.98-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [X] HTML/GWT on Chrome (Windows)","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
