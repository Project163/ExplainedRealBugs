#4164. Adds a new `FilterableVehicleRaycaster` C/C++ class to the custom Bullet wrapper classes and a generated Java class by adding it to the `dynamics.i` interface file.\n\nIncludes a test/demo called `VehicleFilterTest` which extends the existing `VehicleTest`.\n\nThe wrapper code compiles on the Linux and Android platform (Windows and OSX is untested). In order to compile for Android we had to run the `BulletBuild.java` program, which regenerated a file called `Android.mk`. Presumably the automated build system will do this, otherwise we can add it to the PR.\n\nThe demo has been tested on desktop, but we were unable to test on Android because of problems when packaging the Bullet libraries. Neither has it been tested on the other platforms. If someone else could test on Android and the other platforms it would be great.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4361/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":824929964,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODI0OTI5OTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/824929964","actor":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-15T18:55:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":824929979,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgyNDkyOTk3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/824929979","actor":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fea466ccbbb842d2966faa19c51385fd159f5fd8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/fea466ccbbb842d2966faa19c51385fd159f5fd8","created_at":"2016-10-15T18:55:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
