In current realisation when we specify new size, flip stay ignored. For example now `setRegionHeight` function looks like this:\n\n``` java\npublic void setRegionHeight (int height) {\n    setV2(v + height / (float)texture.getHeight());\n}\n```\n\nBut it should looks like this:\n\n``` java\npublic void setRegionHeight (int height) {\n    if (!isFlipY()) setV2(v + height / (float)texture.getHeight());\n    else setV(v + height / (float)texture.getHeight());\n}\n```\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/60378721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"protoukr","id":604916,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDkxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/604916?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr","html_url":"https://github.com/protoukr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/protoukr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/61246877","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2498#issuecomment-61246877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2498","id":61246877,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjQ2ODc3","user":{"login":"nooone","id":5896510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTY1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5896510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone","html_url":"https://github.com/nooone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-31T11:15:29Z","updated_at":"2014-10-31T11:15:29Z","body":"Are you going to create a PR for this?
