In Scene2D you can achieve this effect by setting the knobDown Drawable in `SliderStyle` to to be an upscaled version of the default knob Drawable.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if you set such a `SliderStyle` to it, the value/position of the Slider changes the latest selected value on `touchUp()` event (it is different than the last `touchDragged()` reported value/position).\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the following lines of the method `boolean calculatePositionAndValue (float x, float y)` that determine the value/position of ther slider dependind on the user input position also depend on the active style knob Drawable size:\r\n```\r\n// Gets active style know Drawable\r\nfinal Drawable knob = getKnobDrawable();\r\n[...]\r\nfloat knobWidth = knob == null ? 0 : knob.getMinWidth();\r\nposition = x - bg.getLeftWidth() - knobWidth * 0.5f;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo, while dragging the knob of the Slider to select a value, internally it keeps calling `calculatePositionAndValue()` and because the knob Drawable is always the large knobDown Drawable it keeps conistent.\r\nThe moment a `touchUp()` occurs, `calculatePositionAndValue()` is called again but this time the knob `Drawable` is smaller and the reported value/position changes making it inconsistent.\r\n\r\nA simple way to observe this issue is by adding a `ChangeListener` to the `Slider` and print its `value` on the `onChange` implementation.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
