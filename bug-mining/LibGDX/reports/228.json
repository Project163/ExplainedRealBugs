My app has viewport working in virtual world dimensions 16 units x 9 units. drawDebugBounds is using its coordinates instead of pixel screen resolution and because of this and \"width - 1, height - 1\", every rectangle is one unit short in width (1/16 of viewport) and height (1/9 of viewport). Fullscreen background with 16x9 unit size has 15x8 debug rectangle, sprites with 1x1 unit size has 0x0 debug rectangle, etc.\n\n_my code_\n\n``` java\n        camera = new OrthographicCamera();\n        viewport = new FitViewport(16f, 9f, camera);\n        viewport.apply();\n        stage = new Stage(viewport);\n```\n\n_libgdx/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/Actor.java_\n\n``` java\n    /** Draws a rectange for the bounds of this actor if {@link #getDebug()} is true. */\n    protected void drawDebugBounds (ShapeRenderer shapes) {\n        if (!debug) return;\n        shapes.set(ShapeType.Line);\n        shapes.setColor(stage.getDebugColor());\n        shapes.rect(x, y, originX, originY, width - 1, height - 1, scaleX, scaleY, rotation);\n    }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2989/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
