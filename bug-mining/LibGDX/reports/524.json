Issue details\r\nWhen using split screen mode on iOS the app does not get called with the new dimensions of the screen.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nCreate a new libgdx app. Add `LaunchScreen.storyboard` and update the `Info.plist.xml` with the following\r\n```xml\r\n<key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>\r\n<string>LaunchScreen</string>\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n<key>UIRequiresFullScreen</key>\r\n<true/>\r\n -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n- Libgdx 1.9.11\r\n- Robovm 2.3.7\r\n\r\n#### Logging\r\nI've added logging to the `public void resize(int width, int height)` callback\r\n```\r\n## App start\r\nResize 2388 1620\r\nPlanned content area: 0, 0, 2388, 1580\r\n## Enter splitscreen with 50:50 split\r\nResize 2388 1620\r\nPlanned content area: 0, 0, 2388, 1580\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect that libgdx reports the smaller screen size after the screen has been split.\r\nAny ideas about this issue or is this mode not even supported?\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [X ] iOS
