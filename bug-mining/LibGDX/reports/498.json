In what was probably an attempt to simplify some nasty for loops in https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/a4646767699501745cdd44ae0e5946d9296a2ce6 , the code\r\n```java\r\nfor (int i = valueTable.length; i-- > 0; )\r\n```\r\nin the containsValue() and findKey() methods across all hash-based sets and maps was changed to the non-equivalent and incorrect code\r\n```java\r\nfor (int i = valueTable.length - 1; i > 0; i--)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bug is that `valueTable[0]` never gets checked with this change, even though it's a valid location in the table. **The fix** is just changing the condition to `i >= 0` in the many files that have the bug. It would make sense to \"Find in Files\" for `for (int i = valueTable.length - 1; i > 0; i--)` to locate probable problems.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nReproducing an actual bug from this is hard; it would manifest as a mystery bug where some item might never be found by containsValue() despite being present. I found it using Apache Harmony's JUnit tests, which are quite old, quite ugly, and probably not optimal, but are license-compatible with libGDX and the Apache 2 license, unlike OpenJDK's tests. The specific test is https://github.com/tommyettinger/merry-ds/blob/master/src/test/java/ds/merry/ObjectMapTest.java#L156-L170 . All tests passed with a version of the hash-based data structures from before the earlier-mentioned commit, and only that test (and a similar one for OrderedMap) failed after. When I made the change to `i >= 0`, that let the tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nCurrent nightly, 1.9.11-SNAPSHOT .\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\nNone, a test fails, it just isn't a libGDX test. That means any stack trace I could give would have incorrect line numbers. The fix is easy anyway.\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x] Android\r\n- [x] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [x] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [x] HTML/GWT\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n- [x] Linux\r\n- [x] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
