Due to some internal design decisions it happened to be flipped along the y-axis.\r\nThat `TextureRegion` is added to a previously loaded `TextureAtlas`, so I do not have to manage its disposal myself (call the dispose() method).\r\nThe texture turned blank white when drawn using `SpriteBatch`. When I remove the the code that flips the `TextureRegion`, the texture appears correctly rendered on screen.\r\nI searched the sources and while I didn't find the exact reason, I suspect it to be the re-wrapping of the texture into an `AtlasRegion` inside `TextureAtlas` [(here)](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/c31fe0ad74a35f4b1e898885615f5b91ee382953/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/TextureAtlas.java#L278).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4069263/50179540-94589b00-0307-11e9-8ce8-d8ca5a213ed8.png)\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n```java\r\npackage de.gameplayjdk.test;\r\n\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureAtlas;\r\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureRegion;\r\n\r\npublic class TextureAtlasAddFlippedTextureRegion extends ApplicationAdapter {\r\n    private SpriteBatch batch;\r\n    private Texture texture;\r\n    private TextureAtlas atlas;\r\n\r\n    public void create () {\r\n        this.batch = new SpriteBatch();\r\n        this.texture = new Texture(Gdx.files.internal(\"data/badlogic.jpg\"));\r\n        this.atlas = new TextureAtlas();\r\n\r\n        TextureRegion region = new TextureRegion(this.texture);\r\n        region.flip(false, true);\r\n        this.atlas.addRegion(\"test\", region);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void render () {\r\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\r\n\r\n        this.batch.begin();\r\n        this.batch.draw(this.atlas.findRegion(\"test\"), 100, 100);\r\n        this.batch.end();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n        new LwjglApplication(new TextureAtlasAddFlippedTextureRegion());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI solved the issue by removing the call to `region.flip(false, true)` for now. It would be nice though, if there would be an easier way. I had to change my texture generation code to adapt to the flipped orientation.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nI'm using LibGDX `1.9.8` and I used the `gdx-setup.jar` from 11/15/2018.\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\nUntil now I could only test this on Windows 10.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
