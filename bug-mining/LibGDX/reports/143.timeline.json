UPDATE ****\nFails on the iPhone 5s too\n\n---\n\nHi,\n\nI need some help here.\n\nI updated my game (Rock Ninja) to RoboVM version 0.0.14. Everything worked both on simulator and using the Eclipse plugin \"Run as\" \"iOS Device App\" on my test device (iPod Touch 5th gen iOS 7.1.2). I submitted it for Appstore appoval the 7th July.\n\nToday it's been approved by Apple and when I've tried it it crashes with the following console log:\n\n```\nJul 11 21:34:13 obs-iPod kernel[0] <Debug>: launchd[219] Container: /private/var/mobile/Applications/2DDC0708-D8E8-43C7-847C-9F31F4C1C1F6 (sandbox)\nJul 11 21:34:13 obs-iPod backboardd[28] <Error>: HID: The 'Passive' connection 'RockNinjaGame' access to protected services is denied.\nJul 11 21:34:14 obs-iPod RockNinjaGame[219] <Warning>: Flurry: Starting session on Agent Version [Flurry_iOS_118_4.2.3] \nJul 11 21:34:16 obs-iPod com.apple.launchd[1] (UIKitApplication:com.riftergames.rockninja[0x3c00][219]) <Error>: (UIKitApplication:com.riftergames.rockninja[0x3c00]) Exited with code: 1\nJul 11 21:34:16 obs-iPod backboardd[28] <Warning>: Application 'UIKitApplication:com.riftergames.rockninja[0x3c00]' exited abnormally with exit status 1\n```\n\nNo Crash logs are being generated.\n\nIt's also failing on an iPod Touch 4th gen with iOS 6.1.\n\nI believe it may be related to the use of HTTP connections. According to RoboVM's blog (http://blog.robovm.org/) we need to add this if using HTTP connections:\n\n```\n<forceLinkClasses>\n  <!-- for http: support use -->\n  <pattern>com.android.okhttp.HttpHandler</pattern>\n  <!-- for https: support use -->\n  <pattern>com.android.okhttp.HttpsHandler</pattern>\n</forceLinkClasses>\n```\n\nI didn't add it because everything was working properly. Do you think this may be the cause of the issue?\n\nI'm really not sure how to proceed as I cannot reproduce it locally and Apple Review team has approved an app that doesn't work at all so before republishing I'd like to have some confidence about what is going on.\n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robovm/robovm/issues/388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robovm/robovm/issues/388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/56664120","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2350#issuecomment-56664120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2350","id":56664120,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NjY0MTIw","user":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-24T12:45:32Z","updated_at":"2014-09-24T12:45:32Z","body":"Fixed
