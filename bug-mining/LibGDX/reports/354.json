This results in garbage results while rendering. An easy fix would be to add this line before calling Material.set(): \n`Gdx.gl.glActiveTexture(GL20.GL_TEXTURE0);`\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nManually binding any texture to texture in prior to call `DecalBatch.flush()` will trigger this. The reason this is happening is because `Material.set()` does not explicitly bind the texture to a fixed unit. Instead, the currently active texture unit state is used. The shader program used for decal rendering on the other hand requires `u_texture` to be bound at texture unit 0.\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.7.2\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x] Android\n- [x] iOS\n- [x] HTML/GWT\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] Linux\n- [x] MacOS\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
