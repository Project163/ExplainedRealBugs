I think it's a possible problem, otherwise I beg your pardon.\n\nI came across the reported problem using the method in question in the game I'm trying to do. I thought it was something wrong with my code. Again went over my studies in Camera classes, OrthographicCamera and Viewport. Even redid the exercise of page\n\n[https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Orthographic-camera](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Orthographic-camera)\n\nI made the inclusion of 2 more conditions within the handleInput method to rotate the screen with the rotateAround method and there were no problems with the rendering of Sprite.\n\nBut when the rotation occurs when using OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer or TiledMapRenderer rendering is weird depending on the point chosen for the rotateAround.\n\nI posted a video. I used as an example to play the SuperKoalio. I ran two examples choosing 2 different positions to rotate the camera. In the right window the rotation takes place and the floor disappears. In the left window its just perfectly.\n I had the same problem in my game as the right window.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v35rHSwZhLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v35rHSwZhLE)\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\n-To reproduce the error. I added the code line\n\n`camera.rotateAround (new Vector3 (koala.position.x, koala.position.y, 0), new Vector3 (0,0,1), 1);`\n\nafter the updateKoala (deltaTime) within the render () method, after the line 131.\nIn the video example, the left screen that usually works the koala starting position on the line 116 remained the same.\n\n`koala.position.set(20, 20);`\n\nOn the right screen the koala position was initiated with\n\n`koala.position.set (30, 20);`\n\nline 134 needs to be deleted to Koala be the center point.\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n_Just tested with v9.3\n#### Stacktrace\n\n``` java\n//No stacktrace\n```\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x ] Android\n- [?] iOS (robovm)\n- [?] iOS (MOE)\n- [?] HTML/GWT\n- [ x] Windows\n- [?] Linux\n- [?] MacOS\n\nThank you.
