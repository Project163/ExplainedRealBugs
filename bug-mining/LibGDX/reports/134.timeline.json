So it is a two pass system. Android UI is also done this way, which I found added complexity versus a single pass. Android is pretty bad though, maybe Silverlight is better. :smile: Interesting what they call \"layout slot\". Bit strange that it clips, otherwise it's similar to TableLayout's logical table/cells, but forced on you at the lowest level versus building on top of a 2D scene graph. From the docs is seems it has no way to invalidate only a portion of the layout? Seems `Grid` is the main way to layout. Reminds me of [GridBagLayout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJR9lmjqQo).\n\nAny reason why you implement another layout versus using TableLayout?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/55531438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/55532805","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2334#issuecomment-55532805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2334","id":55532805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTMyODA1","user":{"login":"urrri","id":1422691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI2OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1422691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri","html_url":"https://github.com/urrri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urrri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-14T17:34:31Z","updated_at":"2014-09-14T17:35:45Z","body":"There are 2 main reasons to implement something new:\n1. default layouts very inconsistent.

You'd prefer to force all actors to be laid out with the same layout manager?\n2) I like to think [Table](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/tablelayout) (a part of scene2d.ui) provides the customization needed for nearly any layout. Container, HorizontalGroup, VerticalGroup and Stack are also useful and configurable. What are you missing from these? I don't mean to be defensive, just curious how others perceive my pretty stuff. :wink: \n\nWidget/WidgetGroup sound like what you've described of your layout. To create a new type of layout, you subclass Widget/WidgetGroup, provide a pref size (min and max are optional) and implement `layout()` to size and position children. However, it is quite rare to need to create a new type of layout or to perform layout manually. Instead, Table can layout your actors for you.\n\nHave you seen [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/)?

I just like consistent behavior, e.g. parent has some fixed width and any type of child inside should be shrank to this width, if I (as a programmer) didn't specify something else. In scene2d layout, image will be shrank, but verticalGroup with the same image inside - not. Because its minWidth is hardcoded as prefWidth. I don't remember exact situation for that problem, but I know it is and there are a lot of them.\n2.I like different layouts. Each one for their special purpose. Grid is rich enough, but not universal. And grid in scene2d even less universal then mine. E.g. You cannot add more than one actor to the same cell. You cannot have one actor occupied one cell, second one occupied second cell and 3rd occupied both cells. And many other similar tricks. I don't understand why margins, alignment, etc. should be property of the cell. Why cannot I use the same properties for element inside vertical group or any other layout?\n\nI haven't seen those layouts. I tried to find something, but failed. I found one (maybe one of them), but it was too complicated and not intuitive. So I created mine, based on well known Silverlight behavior.

You _could_ say this is hardcoded and not configurable, but it is not intended to be configurable. Instead it is just the widget providing what it thinks is it's own min, pref, and max size. Whatever is doing layout can use or ignore this information as needed, such as in the example \n\nImage shrinks in your example because it's mine size is 0,0. This is because an image can be scaled down below its pref size as needed. Other widgets return the pref size as the min size because for those widgets it doesn't make sense to size them smaller than the pref size. Eg, it doesn't make sense to size a Label smaller than the text it contains. If you want to you can, the label's min size is just telling its opinion.\n\n2) Table doesn't have multiple actors per cell because I feel that would complicate the API. Instead, a Stack or nested Table can be used in the cell and then multiple actors put into that.\n\nVerticalGroup does have many of the same properties as Table: alignment, padding, etc. Are you suggesting these be part of a base class for widgets? This would mean 1) the widget needs to know how to render respecting these properties (eg padding), which complicates widgets, or 2) every layout manager needs to take these properties into consideration, which complicates layout managers. Some layouts inevitably won't support some properties, which can be confusing (this plagues Swing and other toolkits). It is clean to keep widgets as just doing what they need, and to do layout customization completely in the layout manager.\n\nYeah, I was showing example apps built with scene2d.ui. :smile: I have a short list of layouts managers here:\nhttps://github.com/EsotericSoftware/tablelayout#similar-libraries\nDesignGridLayout is maybe the most interesting (besides TableLayout of course :wink:), as you mostly just add your widgets to it and it automatically does all the layout using canonical grids.
