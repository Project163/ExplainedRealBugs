The `AssetManager` properly handles the Sound lifecycle - they are loaded and then unloaded at the correct times.\n\nVia a process of elimination, I found that calling `preloadEffect` allocates sound memory, and the subsequent `dispose()` does not free it:\n\n```\npublic IOSSound (FileHandle filePath) {\n    soundPath = filePath.file().getPath().replace('\\\\', '/');\n\n    // ------ remove this preloading to fix memory leak ------- //\n    soundBuffer = OALSimpleAudio.sharedInstance().preloadEffect(soundPath);\n\n    channel = OALSimpleAudio.sharedInstance().getChannelSource();\n    sourcePool = channel.getSourcePool().getSources();\n}\n```\n\nlater in IOSSound:\n\n```\n@Override\n    public void dispose () {\n    // ----- should always free sound memory, but doesn’t ------- //\n    OALSimpleAudio.sharedInstance().unloadEffect(soundPath);\n}\n```\n\nIt may be that when a sound is playing, it does not free memory correctly. Or the `unloadEffect` does not work in general. I'll look into making a PR. I was crunched for time so I was more interested in working around the issue than fixing it in libgdx, but we should definitely fix it. The memory leak here was pretty major, around ~16mb total sound memory leaked per screen that used sound.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2906/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
