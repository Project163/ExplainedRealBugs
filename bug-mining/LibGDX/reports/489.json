I'm using non-continuous rendering. There's a blinkTask created for TextField, which is responsible for cursor blinking. When I close a stage (with dispose call) with focus on TextField, than blinkTask is not canceled. In new stage requestRender is still called.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nI saw, that cancel of this task is done, when you redraw field. Workaround is to unfocusAll + draw stage before dispose to disable this blinkTask.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\nI'm not familiar with your code, but I suppose, that end() or clear() action of Actor should be overwritten and blinkTask.cancel() should be there.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nSwitch to non-continuous rendering.\r\nCreate stage.\r\nAdd actor TextField and Button.\r\nFocus TextField (cursor is blinking).\r\nOn button click dispose stage and switch to another one (empty) and log every update.\r\nUpdate shouldn't be done, but it's.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.9\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\nNo stacktrace.\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n- [x] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\nThose two verified, but I suppose it's on all of them.","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
