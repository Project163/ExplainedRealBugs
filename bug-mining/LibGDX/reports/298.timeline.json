current implementation, the loaders still have to be created, which forces the programmer to have about 50 objects created, including e.g. `JsonReader` & objects allocated by it, to spend both CPU & memory on them, regardless of the fact if he will use them or not. I seriously doubt if many people use more than about of half of them, by the way. Forcing an API user to do things he doesn't want to when there is no real need to do so is hardly a good idea IMO.\n\nAlso, I see no possible downside in creating a constructor allowing creation with no defaults. Some libGDX classes have dozens of constructors. AssetManager has two. Having three is hardly a bloat IMO.\n\nOn the other hand, existing coupling between AssetManager and related classes prevents solving this by reimplementing the manager.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/74778772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FyiurAmron","id":11016998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDE2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11016998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron","html_url":"https://github.com/FyiurAmron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/76131136","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2855#issuecomment-76131136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2855","id":76131136,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTMxMTM2","user":{"login":"nooone","id":5896510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTY1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5896510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone","html_url":"https://github.com/nooone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nooone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-26T06:56:13Z","updated_at":"2015-02-26T06:56:13Z","body":"I'd say that most people actually use more than half ot the loaders.
