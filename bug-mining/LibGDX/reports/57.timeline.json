As far as ownership/lifecycle goes. Do you mean what happens if the user destroys the constituent joints without also destroying the GearJoint? I think this is something that ultimately falls on the user to ensure happens. Here's what the Box2D manual has to say on the matter:\n\n> Always delete gear joints before the revolute/prismatic joints on the gears. Otherwise your code\n> will crash in a bad way due to the orphaned joint pointers in the gear joint. You should also\n> delete the gear joint before you delete any of the bodies involved.\n\nI think given this (and the fact that not even box2d makes an attempt to ensure it happens correctly) there isn't a whole lot we can do but put it in the user's control. Maybe we just need to add a big warning to GearJoint given the fragility of them.\n\nIf you get a chance, could you take a look at this commit and offer any thoughts on it -
