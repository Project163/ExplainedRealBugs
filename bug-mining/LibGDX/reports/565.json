I have an entire scene with thousands of triangles rendered just fine, but when running on PC there are extraneous triangles being drawn all over the scene. I tracked the problem down to  glDrawElements(). On PC desktop launch, glDrawElements() draws incorrect number of indices, ignoring the numIndices second parameter completely.\r\n\r\n    GLES20.glDrawElements(GL20.GL_TRIANGLES, numIndices, GL20.GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, mIndices);\r\n\r\nFor example, changing the numIndices to 3 should render only one triangle. \r\n\r\n    GLES20.glDrawElements(GL20.GL_TRIANGLES, 3, GL20.GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, mIndices);\r\n\r\nHere is the expected correct result on Android.\r\n\r\n  ![imageandroid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84444721/128443889-55266ff4-225d-4592-ae60-3d9efed30094.jpg)\r\n\r\nBut the desktop launch show all triangles, ignoring numIndices completely.\r\n\r\n![imagepc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84444721/128443905-28a6fca4-5045-4184-bb1f-f9108b1ec938.png)\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nAn SSCCE can be found at\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/arashbi/5659096\r\n\r\nNOTE: There is one bug.
