However with this change you post all the updates to the main loop and this will destory all benefits coming from the callback. Moreover, this create a crazy behavior becuase after the mouse is released `ApplicationListener#resize` function is called hundred times at same time which create a very bad experience. I usually get a `not responding` window while resizing becuase of this.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nThe issue can be reproduced easly in Windows OS with a very basic application:\r\n```Java\r\n    private static class TestApp implements ApplicationListener {\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void create() {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void resize(int width, int height) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Resize\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void render() {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void pause() {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void resume() {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void dispose() {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nDuring window resize the rendering is froozen and the resize function is not called until you release the mouse. After, the resize method will be invoked hundred of times. It might produce a `no responding` window.\r\n\r\n#### Version of libGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nlatest libGDX 1.10.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [X] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] macOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
