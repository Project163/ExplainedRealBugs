But if the right button is pressed, left button is detected after the first try, and after that right button touchUp is not detected.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nGiven the snippet for handling Input Processing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGdx.input.setInputProcessor(new InputAdapter() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean touchDown(int screenX, int screenY, int pointer, int button) {\r\n            Engine.console(\"down: \" + pointer + \" \" + button);\r\n            return super.touchDown(screenX, screenY, pointer, button);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean touchUp(int screenX, int screenY, int pointer, int button) {\r\n            Engine.console(\"up: \" + pointer + \" \" + button);\r\n            return super.touchUp(screenX, screenY, pointer, button);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\n    (I physically press left click down)\r\n    \r\n    [LOG] down: 0 0\r\n    \r\n    (I physically press right click down)\r\n    \r\n    [LOG] down: 0 1\r\n    \r\n    (I physically release left click)\r\n    \r\n    [LOG] up: 0 0\r\n    \r\n    (I physically release right click)\r\n    \r\n    [LOG] up: 0 1\r\n\r\n**Observed Behavior:**\r\n\r\n    (I physically press left click down)\r\n    \r\n    [LOG] down: 0 0\r\n    \r\n    (I physically press right click down)\r\n    \r\n    nothing detected\r\n    \r\n    (I physically release left click)\r\n    \r\n    [LOG] up: 0 0\r\n    \r\n    (I physically release right click)\r\n    \r\n    nothing detected\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nLibGDX 1.9.7.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\nSeveral players of our game are reporting this bug (using various browsers).
