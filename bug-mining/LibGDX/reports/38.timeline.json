a lot for a fix.\n\nBuy the way I have found another interesting behaviour of AssetLoader. It effectively removes loading of duplicate resources when the requests are from DIFFERENT load requests.\n\nTo clearify. If a 3D model loads a texture and a texture atlas load the same texture - it will be loaded only once.\n\nBut image we have a 3D model which is referencing the SAME texture several times. Yes, it is not optimal and we can can optimize it in Blender, but just let's imagine. In this case ModelLoader will return dependency array with several entrance of the same texture. And it will be loaded ше several times. And then we will have troubles (message from AssetLoader) during unloading, because it will try to unload the texture will the same name several times. Possibly also a leakage here.\n\nAs for me I solved this problems with a fast&dirty solution. I use the simple function that cleanups the dependency array right after it is returned by the loader and before it goes to the AssetManager. Like:\n\npublic static Array<AssetDescriptor> cleanUpDependencies(final Array<AssetDescriptor> deps)\n{\n    // search and remove if duplicated\n    OUTER:\n    for (int i = deps.size; i-- > 0; ) {\n        final AssetDescriptor dep = deps.get(i);\n        for (int j = i; j-- > 0; ) {\n            final AssetDescriptor dep2 = deps.get(j);\n            if (dep.fileName.equals(dep2.fileName) && dep.type == dep2.type) {\n                deps.removeIndex(i);\n                continue OUTER;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nreturn deps;\n```\n\n}\n\nFor me it is not the problem because I have anyway to fix ModelLoader to enable MapMapping and setting texture formats. But for other it can matter.\n\nPlease inform if I should open a ticket about this behaviour or just leave it here.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/34189464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"titovmaxim","id":1524918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim","html_url":"https://github.com/titovmaxim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/34190278","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1278#issuecomment-34190278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1278","id":34190278,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTkwMjc4","user":{"login":"titovmaxim","id":1524918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim","html_url":"https://github.com/titovmaxim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-05T15:35:08Z","updated_at":"2014-02-05T15:35:08Z","body":"P.S.
