Press the \"P\" key to pause the logging task thus stopping the message from appearing. \n2. Make game window loose focus (e.g., by focusing on different window). \n3. Focus back on game window.\n4. Press the \"R\" key to resume the stopped task.\nExpected result:\nThe task should be resumed and the message should appear every second.\nActual result:\nThe task is not resumed. The message does not appear.\n\nTested on OS X Yosemite, with latest libgdx (1.6.1).\n\n``` java\npackage com.badlogic.drop.desktop;\n\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Game;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ScreenAdapter;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Input.Keys;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplicationConfiguration;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Timer;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Timer.Task;\n\npublic class DesktopLauncher {\n    public static class BugReproduce extends Game{\n\n        @Override\n        public void create() {\n            Timer.schedule(new Task() {\n\n                @Override\n                public void run() {\n                    Gdx.app.log(\"Bug\", \"foo\");\n                }\n            }, 1, 1);\n            setScreen(new ScreenAdapter()); \n        }\n        @Override\n        public void render() {\n            super.render();        \n            if (Gdx.input.isKeyPressed(Keys.P)){\n                Timer.instance().stop();\n            }\n            if (Gdx.input.isKeyPressed(Keys.R)){\n                Timer.instance().start();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    public static void main (String[] arg) {\n        LwjglApplicationConfiguration config = new LwjglApplicationConfiguration();\n        config.title = \"BugReproduce\";\n        new LwjglApplication(new BugReproduce(), config);\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
