More precisely, the fact that the finger was not removed.\r\nAnd then if you move with one single finger, it will be considered that “pinching” is happening, and instead of moving, make a \"zoom\" here\r\n![image](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/assets/12183149/6abfac3b-efb2-41d8-a4fd-5c4ddd40da2f)\r\nAnd all because here the check is incorrectly verified, mistakenly believing that the finger was not released.\r\n![image](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/assets/12183149/243fad4b-864e-4735-b451-e74e09eb75dd)\r\nIf you then press with two fingers at the same time, everything will return to normal.\r\nWe use libgdx in different modules, and each one has this problem, regardless of the screen.\r\n\r\n#### Version of libGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n_Version 1.12.0_\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"crykn","id":8125827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjU4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8125827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn","html_url":"https://github.com/crykn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/7256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/7256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
