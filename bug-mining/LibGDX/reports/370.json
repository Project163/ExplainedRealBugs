From what I can gather, these log messages are always sent to stdout as that is the default behavior of the lwjgl logger. \n\nI suggest adding a feature which would allow developers to change that default behavior and set a different output stream/writer, add new writers, or hook onto the current log methods so that they might also be output somewhere else (such as a file or dev console).\n\nFor example, let's say that the game has a dev console and we wish to redirect all logging calls to the in-game dev console instead of stdout. Ideally it would look something like this:\n\n```\n// Create a custom output writer\npublic class ConsoleWriter extends Writer     \n     //........\n     public void write(char cbuf[], int off, int len) throws IOException {\n           console.write(cbuf, off, len);\n     }\n     //........\n}\n\nGdx.app.setLogWriter(new ConsoleWriter()); \n// from this point on all Gdx.app.log/error/debug invocations will write to the ConsoleWriter instead of stdout\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
