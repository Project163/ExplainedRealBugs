Issue details\r\nCommon xml characters (e.g. `<>&\"`) get encoded (e.g. `&amp;`) inside a `.tmx` file.\r\n\r\nLibgdx doesn't convert those values back to their original values and keeps those instead.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n* Create a new tilemap in tiled.\r\n* Create a new tileset.\r\n* Create a custom property on a tile in the tileset with key `hi&` and value `Hello&<>\"`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11274700/111854436-8eefbe00-891f-11eb-8410-514c4e725f7c.png)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<properties>\r\n    <property name=\"hi&amp;\" value=\"Hello&amp;&lt;&gt;&quot;\"/>\r\n</properties>\r\n```\r\n* Parse that propery in libgdx:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (int x = 0; x < layer.getWidth(); x++)\r\n{\r\n    for (int y = 0; y < layer.getHeight(); y++)\r\n    {\r\n        TiledMapTileLayer.Cell cell = layer.getCell(x, y);\r\n        if (cell == null)\r\n            continue;\r\n\r\n        String prop = cell.getTile().getProperties().get(\"hi&\", null, String.class); // never triggers\r\n        if (prop != null)\r\n        {\r\n            System.out.println(prop);\r\n            return;\r\n

Prints Hello&amp;&lt;&gt;&quot;\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected\r\n\r\nThe key `hi&` should exist, and it's value should be `Hello&<>\"`\r\n\r\n#### Actually\r\n\r\nThe key `hi&amp;` exists and it's value is `Hello&amp;&lt;&gt;&quot;`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.14\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Please select the
