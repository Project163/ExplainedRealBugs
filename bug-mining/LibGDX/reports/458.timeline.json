E.g. on some iOS simulators that workaround doesn't give consistent results. On some, 3 same characters are required, on some, 2 characters are too much... You can't guarantee which characters need this workaround. Etc.\n\nAt this stage, instead of using FreeTypeFontGenerator.generateFont() I'm using FreeTypeFontGenerator.generateGlyphAndBitmap() for each separate character (I'm using this technique to generate app icons from a ttf-font). Then I'm packing pixmaps obtained from bitmaps with PixmapPacker to get a TextureAtlas with icons.\n\nIt looks that the generateGlyphAndBitmap method works consistently on different

In this post I will provide some observed examples.\n\nHere's a barebones version of my code. Please, download the test-font here:\nhttps://github.com/serhii-k/test/blob/master/android/assets/test-font.ttf\n\n```\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Color;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.BitmapFont;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureRegion;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.freetype.FreeTypeFontGenerator;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Array;\n\npublic class TestFont extends ApplicationAdapter {\n\n    SpriteBatch batch;\n    BitmapFont font;\n\n    Array<TextureRegion> regions;\n\n    @Override\n    public void create() {\n        batch = new SpriteBatch();\n\n        FreeTypeFontGenerator generator = new FreeTypeFontGenerator(Gdx.files.internal(\"test-font.ttf\"));\n        FreeTypeFontGenerator.FreeTypeFontParameter parameter = new FreeTypeFontGenerator.FreeTypeFontParameter();\n        parameter.characters = \"mm\";\n        parameter.size = 150;\n        parameter.gamma = 0.5f;\n        font = generator.generateFont(parameter);\n        generator.dispose();\n\n        regions = font.getRegions();\n        Gdx.app.log(\"getRegions.size\", regions.size + \"\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render() {\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1f);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n        batch.begin();\n\n        batch.setColor(Color.WHITE);\n        font.draw(batch, \"m\", 100, 450);\n\n        batch.setColor(Color.BLUE);\n        batch.draw(regions.get(0), 10, 10, regions.get(0).getRegionWidth(), regions.get(0).getRegionHeight());\n\n        if (regions.size > 1) {\n            batch.setColor(Color.RED);\n            batch.draw(regions.get(1), 10 + regions.get(0).getRegionWidth() + 10, 10,\n                    regions.get(1).getRegionWidth(), regions.get(1).getRegionHeight());\n        }\n\n        batch.end();\n    }\n\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception {\n        new LwjglApplication(new TestFont());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nif `parameter.characters = \"m\";` only one 256x256 region is generated. But, look, it has some awkward square... Strange, ha? The actual character is placed below this square and partially is outside the region...\n\n![m](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10563821/13350008/296fdede-dc86-11e5-8bed-39474ab7e91a.png)\n\nIf `parameter.characters = \"mm\";` two 256x256 regions are generated. The first one is same as in the first case, the second one has a correctly placed character.\n\n![mm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10563821/13350052/55e6e688-dc86-11e5-88de-44f4132331fc.png)\n\nSo, the issue is really in the packaging of the glyphs to the texture as @intrigus has noted. In the example, the strange square appears.\n\nIf the font size is lower, let's say 32 pixels instead of 150, the issue remains the same. Only the generated regions are smaller.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/189217058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"serhii-k","id":10563821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYzODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10563821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k","html_url":"https://github.com/serhii-k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/serhii-k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":567291249,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTY3MjkxMjQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/567291249","actor":{"login":"intrigus","id":10353467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzUzNDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10353467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus","html_url":"https://github.com/intrigus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-26T10:46:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":567291250,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU2NzI5MTI1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/567291250","actor":{"login":"intrigus","id":10353467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzUzNDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10353467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus","html_url":"https://github.com/intrigus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intrigus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-26T10:46:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/189446915","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3791#issuecomment-189446915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3791","id":189446915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTQ0NjkxNQ==","user":{"login":"Darkyenus","id":5280068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODAwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5280068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus","html_url":"https://github.com/Darkyenus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-26T19:36:28Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T19:36:28Z","body":"Incremental

The android device I am testing on has a higher dpi so the icons will have more pixels.\n- Sometimes when I add just 2 to the parameter.size, they render correctly.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/260183746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"funkyfourier","id":272493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjQ5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/272493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier","html_url":"https://github.com/funkyfourier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfourier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/409887902","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3791#issuecomment-409887902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3791","id":409887902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTg4NzkwMg==","user":{"login":"dylan9","id":11692650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjkyNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11692650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9","html_url":"https://github.com/dylan9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylan9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-02T10:56:03Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T10:56:23Z","body":"Hi.
