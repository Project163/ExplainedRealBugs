Thus, I don't believe this is a duplicate of #2977)\n\nIn my game, I have a single FreeTypeFontGenerator (since I only have one TTF file), but I create three different fonts using that generator by using different FreeTypeFontParameter values (different sizes, colours, border widths etc).\n\nTrying out gdx 1.5.6-SNAPSHOT, I've modified my code now so that if I create my fonts up-front everything is rendering correctly.  However, if I set `parameter.incremental = true` and `parameter.characters = \"\"` so it generates everything incrementally, the different fonts are all rendering the same size as each other despite having different size parameters.  The other differences, e.g. colours, border sizes, drop shadows etc are displayed correctly.  If I change my code to create a new instance of FreeTypeFontGenerator for each different configuration of FreeTypeFontParameter, the incremental fonts go back to being sized correctly, so presumably there's something being set in the shared generator instead of the distinct data instances which is causing this.\n\nAs part of debugging this, I've dumped out the texture atlas using PixmapPackerIO, so I can see that the glyphs are indeed being created with the incorrect (equal) size - it's not something to do with the way that I'm rendering them.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2981/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
