This has been a feature of LWJGL since 3.1.4. It is only a matter of adding the window hint GLFW_TRANSPARENT_FRAMEBUFFER. This will allow for some neat effects with an undecorated window. I have tested and it works on my Windows 10 computer.\r\n\r\n![Sample Image](https://ray3k.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/transparent-window.png)\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nAdd the following to LWJGL3Application.createGlfwWindow():\r\n`GLFW.glfwWindowHint(GLFW.GLFW_TRANSPARENT_FRAMEBUFFER, GLFW.GLFW_TRUE);`\r\n\r\nIn your LibGDX desktop app, use the following to clear the screen in the render method:\r\n`Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0, 0, 0, 0);\r\nGdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);`\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.9-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n- [x] Linux\r\n- [x] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
