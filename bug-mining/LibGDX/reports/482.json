Since there is a default constructor `TextureRegion region = new TextureRegion()` I think this should not happen. If it should happen, the empty constructor should not be available.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nRun this code:\r\n```java\r\nprivate TextureRegion region = new TextureRegion();\r\nprivate SpriteBatch batch = new SpriteBatch();\r\n\r\nprivate void draw()\r\n{\r\n  batch.begin();\r\n  batch.draw(region, 0f, 0f, 1024f, 512f);\r\n  batch.end();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be prevented by:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void draw()\r\n{\r\n  batch.begin();\r\n  if(region.getTexture() != null) { batch.draw(region, 0f, 0f, 1024f, 512f); }\r\n  batch.end();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.9\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n```java\r\nException in thread \"LWJGL Application\" java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch.flush(SpriteBatch.java:960)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.SpriteBatch.end(SpriteBatch.java:185)\r\n\tat de.limbusdev.guardianmonsters.ui.AScreen.drawBackground(AScreen.kt:64)\r\n\tat de.limbusdev.guardianmonsters.ui.AScreen.render(AScreen.kt:80)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.Game.render(Game.java:46)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication.mainLoop(LwjglApplication.java:225)\r\n\tat com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication$1.run(LwjglApplication.java:126)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\nI guess all.","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
