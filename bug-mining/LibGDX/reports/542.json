Calling `openURI(...)` does nothing. There is no error thrown. \r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nLatest stable release 1.9.13. The Android project has to be set to Android 11 (30).\r\n\r\n#### Suggestion for Code Fix\r\nA quick test showed the following code works. The live wallpaper flag needs to be set. Also, does this really need to run via UI thread as in libGDX's example? \r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n   // open with the correct activity if any \r\n   startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(url)));\r\n   return true;\r\n}\r\ncatch (Exception e) {\r\n   // ... log error...\r\n   return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x ] Android 11\r\n- [ ] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
