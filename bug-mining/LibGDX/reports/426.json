For example in attached fnt file there is entry for char `id=21457`, but glyph for this character does not exist on generated texture. In fact glyph's coordinates exceed texture size. For mentioned character coordinates in *.fnt file are\n`x=0    y=945  width=164  height=153`\nTexture size is set to 1024x1024 and 945+153 exceedes this size.\nI noticed this only when used with big font sizes and only when multiple pages are created.\nI attach generated *.fnt file and *.hiero settings file. I could also attach generated textures if that helps.\n\n[test.fnt.txt](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/110512/test.fnt.txt)\n[test.hiero.txt](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/files/110514/test.hiero.txt)\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3800/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
