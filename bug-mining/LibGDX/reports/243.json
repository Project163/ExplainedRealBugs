Most of the fontsize-related code (`scaleAndComputePrefSize()`, `layout()`) is thus wrapped into\n\n```\nfloat oldScaleX = font.getScaleX();\nfloat oldScaleY = font.getScaleY();\nif (fontScaleX != 1 || fontScaleY != 1) font.getData().setScale(fontScaleX, fontScaleY);\n//actual code\nif (fontScaleX != 1 || fontScaleY != 1) font.getData().setScale(oldScaleX, oldScaleY);\n```\n\nwhich does it job good. There is one exception: `getPrefHeight()` (also called by `pack()`), which uses https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/Label.java#L230 , i.e. it has `style.font.getDescent()` - which is derived from font's scale by itself. Thus, changing the font size on the Label still generates the pref. height of a font with descent of font with no Label's Y scaling applied. With large font scale values used (i.e. 0.1) this generates a huge visual offset.\n\nSuggested solution is to use\n\n```\nfloat height = prefSize.y - style.font.getDescent() * fontScaleY * 2;\n```\n\ninstead.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3073/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
