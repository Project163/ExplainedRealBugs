TweenEngine solves this with a function called getRunningTweensCount() which can be used to turn setContinousRendering() on and off, like this:\n\n```\n    float dt = Gdx.graphics.isContinuousRendering() ? deltaTime : 1f/60;\n    manager.update(dt); // update tweens\n    Gdx.graphics.setContinuousRendering(manager.getRunningTweensCount() > 0);\n```\n\nThere doesn't seem to be an equivalent function to getRunningTweensCount() for Actions. One possible implementation is to add a static counter in Actor.act() that's incremented when actions are fired and have a function in Stage that checks to see if this counter changed since the last frame.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
