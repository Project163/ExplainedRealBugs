It will leak memory every time you tap the screen.\n\nThe problematic method is this one:\n\n``` java\n    public void leak () {\n        new FacedCubemapData(\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\"),\n                Gdx.files.internal(\"face.png\")\n        );\n    }\n```\n\nYes, it doesn't do anything useful but it's just a proof of concept =].  \nThe GC will remove our `FacedCubemapData`, keeping `Pixmap`s on the **native heap**. You can check the behavior by issuing the following command:\n\n```\nadb shell dumpsys meminfo in.lucasdup.leaktest\n```\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\ngdxVersion = '1.9.3'\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [X] Android\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\n- [ ] Windows\n- [ ] Linux\n- [ ] MacOS\n\nI've been testing this on Android but probably other platforms are also affected.\n\nPS: I can help with a fix / pull request\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
