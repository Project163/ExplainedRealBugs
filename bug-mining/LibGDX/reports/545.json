The configuration option is useless because of this.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the `NetJavaImpl` creates a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with work queue set to `SynchronousQueue` instance. The `SynchronousQueue` offer method always rejects an item, thus if active count is higher then maximal thread pool size (set by `maxNetThread`) the task is not accepted (`ThreadPoolExecutor#execute` throws `LinkedBlockingQueue`).\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n```java\r\n// config settings\r\nconfig.maxNetThreads = 5;\r\n\r\n// Listener\r\nclass MyHttpResponseListener implements Net.HttpResponseListener {\r\n  void handleHttpResponse (HttpResponse httpResponse) {}\r\n  void failed (Throwable t) {\r\n    System.out.println(\"failed: \" + t.getMessage());\r\n  }\r\n  void cancelled () {}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// create more then 5 HTTP requests\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {\r\n  HttpRequest httpRequest = /* ... */;\r\n  Gdx.net.sendHttpRequest(httpRequest, null); // the sixth request will print message `failed: ...`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n_1.9.14_\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\nFor  `maxNetThread` set to 5:\r\n```java\r\nTask java.util.concurrent.FutureTask@34f07602 rejected from java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor@49035613[Running, pool size = 5, active threads = 5, queued tasks = 0, completed tasks = 0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x] Android\r\n- [x] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n- [x] Linux\r\n- [x] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6433/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
