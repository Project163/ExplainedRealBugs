\r\n> \r\n> @Extain You'll need to show what problem you are having before anyone can fix it.\r\n\r\nI'm using 1.9.10 encounterd the same issue.\r\n\r\nThe reason the test works is because in the dragStart method you create a new actor, namely a Label, and set it as the dragActor. The use case here is if the dragActor is set via the getActor() method for example. In these cases the idea is to drag the actual actor that has been picked up, not a derivative. If you change the test on line 68 to use getActor() you should be able to reproduce.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/619353757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kamarad","id":4341163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDExNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4341163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad","html_url":"https://github.com/kamarad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamarad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3271770517,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI3MTc3MDUxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3271770517","actor":{"login":"Extain","id":8728733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Mjg3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8728733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain","html_url":"https://github.com/Extain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-25T09:56:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3271770518,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNzE3NzA1MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3271770518","actor":{"login":"Extain","id":8728733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Mjg3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8728733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain","html_url":"https://github.com/Extain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Extain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-25T09:56:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/619383598","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5675#issuecomment-619383598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5675","id":619383598,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxOTM4MzU5OA==","user":{"login":"kdenzel","id":31431312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDMxMzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31431312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel","html_url":"https://github.com/kdenzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdenzel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-25T13:56:56Z","updated_at":"2020-04-25T13:58:45Z","body":"I
