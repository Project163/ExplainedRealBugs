I don't think that this is good. Many people rely on the fact that getApplicationListener() returns the AppListener, but NOT a new AppListener every time it's called.\n\nI propose to cache the value, and only create a new AppListener, if the cache is null.\n\n```\npublic class HtmlLauncher extends GwtApplication {\n        private ApplicationListener listener;\n        @Override\n        public GwtApplicationConfiguration getConfig () {\n                return new GwtApplicationConfiguration(480, 320);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public ApplicationListener getApplicationListener () {\n                if(listener == null) {\n                        listener = new %MAIN_CLASS%();\n                }\n                return listener;         \n        }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
