By going through the code myself I found out that it isn't trivial to fix this by a long shot and requires a re-write even perhaps braking the API. \n\nFor my use, I am changing all of my game strings on init adding an extra space where need, keeping my resource files correct as to remove this init code if the bug gets fixed. This is how I dealt with it, but you can still point it out if you know where & what to look for.\n\nThis issue has been open for 2 months now.

Consider:\n\n```\nfont.draw(batch, \"A[RED] B[]\", 200, 200);\n// run 1 width: 0 \"A\" offset + 22 \"A\" width = 22\n// run 2 width: 0 \" \" offset + 9 \" \" xadvance + 22 \"B\" width = 31\n// total width: 53\nfont.draw(batch, \"A [RED]B[]C\", 200, 170);\n// run 1 width: 0 \"A\" offset + 21 \"A\" xadvance + 9 \" \" width = 30\n// run 2 width: -3 \"B\" offset + 22 \"B\" width = 19\n// total width: 49\n```\n\nTightly fitting bounds are useful for word wrap or other situations where you don't want text drawn outside of some bounds. Because we use runs for colors, unfortunately the tightly fitting bounds result in different glyph spacing than when laying out the glyphs without colors.\n\nTo fix this we can turn off tightly fitting bounds for a run delimited by a color tag. Wrapping or other measuring of a \"color\" run may not have tightly fitting bounds, but this seems more acceptable than color tags changing the spacing between glyphs.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/163818964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":488926090,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ4ODkyNjA5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/488926090","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8ed9d9d928cee9008fb055dc67a3588d0f15be8c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/8ed9d9d928cee9008fb055dc67a3588d0f15be8c","created_at":"2015-12-11T02:41:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1654998855,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NTQ5OTg4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1654998855","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"beeef537dd7f76c72e124a5be674cd0c3b2b76f6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/beeef537dd7f76c72e124a5be674cd0c3b2b76f6","created_at":"2018-05-31T02:30:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1655088240,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NTUwODgyNDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1655088240","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events
