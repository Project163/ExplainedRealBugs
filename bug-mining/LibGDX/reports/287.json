Namely, you obtain() objects from the fixturePool forever, and never free any of them after the parent body is destroyed.  While Body has a reset() method that purports to return the freed fixtures to the pool, it doesn't work correctly because 1) Body.reset isn't called until someone tries to reobtain the freed Body and 2) all the fixtures have been removed from the Body at that point, so an empty list of Fixtures is freed.\n\nI have a fix for this.\n","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
