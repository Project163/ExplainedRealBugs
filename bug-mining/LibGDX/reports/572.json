There is almost a second of black screen after the storyboard launch screen disappears and my Scene2D launch screen appears, which is not acceptable (Apple review does reject such glitches).\r\nBy using static images for the iOS launch screen the issue goes away with the RoboVM backend.\r\n\r\n1. Static images, robovm backend: seamless transition\r\n2. Static images, metalangle backend: 1 frame of half rendered half black screen on simulator\r\n3. Storyboard, robovm backend: several black frames\r\n4. Storyboard, metalangle backend: about 1 second of black screen on simulator\r\n\r\n#### Probable cause\r\nBy design the iOS splash screen fades out once the method didFinishLaunching() of the app delegate returned. At this time the next view controller needs to be setup already. \r\nWith libGDX this means that the OpenGL/Metal view needs to have started drawing its content **before** didFinishLaunching is complete.\r\n\r\nCurrently the way the iOS backend is setup makes this impossible. The ApplicationListener.create() method as well as the completion of the OpenGL setup are called **after** didFinishLaunching().\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Version of libGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.11.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [X] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] macOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
