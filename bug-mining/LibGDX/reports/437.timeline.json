Issue details\r\nOn my Android 7.0 smartphone some sounds are gone at play mission time. Usually it happened on looped \"engine\" sound. But also gone other random sounds like shot, explosion, collision and so on. On Android 4.4 all works fine. I solved this problem by writing my own AndroidSound class that use new way to initialize SoundPool. And also increase priority for looping sounds. \r\nI think it should be applied for all, so I suggest you to fix this:\r\n\r\n**gdx.backends.android.AndroidAudio.java constructor must be updated by this way:**\r\n```\r\npublic AndroidAudio (Context context, AndroidApplicationConfiguration config) {\r\n      if (!config.disableAudio) {\r\n         if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {\r\n            AudioAttributes audioAttrib = new AudioAttributes.Builder()\r\n                  .setUsage(AudioAttributes.USAGE_GAME)\r\n                  .setContentType(AudioAttributes.CONTENT_TYPE_SONIFICATION)\r\n                  .build();\r\n            soundPool = new SoundPool.Builder().setAudioAttributes(audioAttrib).setMaxStreams(config.maxSimultaneousSounds).build();\r\n         }else {\r\n            soundPool = new SoundPool(config.maxSimultaneousSounds, AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 0);// srcQuality: the sample-rate converter quality. Currently has no effect. Use 0 for the default.\r\n         }\r\n         manager = (AudioManager)context.getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE);\r\n         if (context instanceof Activity) {\r\n            ((Activity)context).setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC);\r\n         }\r\n      } else {\r\n         soundPool = null;\r\n         manager = null;\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nAlso, I recommend increase sound priority in loop(...) methods. Right now it's equal 1 and it's the same as used in play(...) methods. But looped sound usually must play until game logic didn't stop it. So, it can not be removed by SoundPool inner sound manager. Therefor priority in loop(...) method must be greater then used in play(...) \r\n**gdx.backends.android.AndroidSound.java \r\n-public long loop (float volume) and\r\n-public long loop (float volume, float pitch, float pan) \r\nrecommend to update priority from 1 to something greater, for example 3:**\r\n`int streamId = soundPool.play(soundId, leftVolume, rightVolume, 3, -1, pitch); // set priority greater(3) then used in play method(1)`\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.8\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x] Android\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5059/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/363188184","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5064#issuecomment-363188184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5064","id":363188184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzE4ODE4NA==","user":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-05T19:06:49Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T19:07:08Z","body":"Pushed new API.

backends are implemented (except desktop). I tested GWT and Android and they work well. I can't test the ios backends (I got no apple device to compile) so it would be great if someone could test it. (And in case it doesn't work help me fixing.) I implemented ios with [this](https://github.com/robovm/robovm-samples/tree/master/ios/locateme) samples so i hope it works.\r\n\r\nSince Android Marshmallow, the user has to enable the permissions for apps by hand. This can be a bit annoying to go into the system settings and turn them on. I wanted to add a method `requestPermission()` into `AndroidApplication.java` which ask the user for the permission (for example location) like [this ](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting). The problem is, libgdx is currently using _support-v4-19.0.1.jar_ as support library which doesn't offer these methods. Can I upgrade this lib or is there any reason for keep the old version? Should I add this change to this pr or make another one?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
