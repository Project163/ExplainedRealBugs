Also not sure what you mean by \"then it's too late and it is always drawn too big\": `draw` sets the background, then draws it. An [executable example](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-help#executable-example-code) would help a lot.\n\nThere does seem to be an issue with Button. 1) Button sets the background based on the button state (up, down, checked, etc), 2) the button padding comes from the background, and 3) the padding is used when computing the pref size. The odd part: the padding from the background is only applied when the style is set. If the background is changed later (eg due to the button state changing) the padding is not changed. The reason is if the padding changes then the pref size changes and `invalidateHierarchy` has to be called. `draw` calls `setBackground` every frame, so calling `invalidateHierarchy` or even `invalidate` is undesirable. The drawback is that drawable padding can't be used to adjust a button based on the button state.\n\nI will make changes to attempt to avoid setting the padding and if the padding needs to be set, attempt to avoid `invalidateHierarchy` if the total x and y padding didn't change. This may affect existing UIs, but having Button respect the padding of all drawables makes more sense than having it only use the first one.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/55308256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":164381474,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NDM4MTQ3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/164381474","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"352e9bef9e98fd939901312939ff13a3aae66f72","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/352e9bef9e98fd939901312939ff13a3aae66f72","created_at":"2014-09-11T18:38:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/55308601","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2322#issuecomment-55308601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2322","id":55308601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzA4NjAx","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-11T18:40:41Z","updated_at":"2014-09-11T18:40:41Z","body":"Now that Button always uses the padding from the background drawable, I'll have it update the padding in `setStyle`.

Table padding now uses `Value` instances that pull their value from the Table background. This means if you don't set the padding, it comes from the background. If you set the padding, your value is used instead in that direction. This should provide the best of both worlds and fixes the issue not just for `Button` but for

ensure you have given all the following requested information in your report.\r\n\r\n#### Issue details\r\nWe encountered two issues related to application windows on MacOS:\r\n- When the app window is resized, the app very often (but not always) crashes\r\n- When the app window is closed, sometimes the app does not quit, but the window cannot be reopened. WindowListener's closeRequested is not triggered.\r\n- \r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n- Resize an app window, the app crashes with exception \"failed assertion `A command encoder is already encoding to this command buffer\"\r\n- Move the app window around a little bit, minimize, reopen the app window, then close the app window (by clicking the X button, or press Command Q). Observe that the app is not quit, but the window cannot be reopened.\r\n\r\n#### Version of libGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nlibgdx = 1.11.0\r\nroboVM version = 2.3.16\r\ncom.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-lwjgl3-glfw-awt-macos extension is used.\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ x] macOS\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6992/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6992/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
