We already null check most of the stage access, so I suppose it's fine to check the few we don't. I would expect there to always be a stage in `draw`, unless someone wants to draw an actor without putting it in the stage for reasons (though they could put it in the stage, draw, then remove it). Other scenarios might be multi threading or removing the actor during `draw`, both of which should be avoided. It's not great that you don't have a reproduction case for the crashes you see.\r\n\r\nMost actors are OK drawing without a stage except those that rely on clipping, which needs a stage to get the viewport for `calculateScissors`. Actors with that problem are any that call `clipBegin`, plus `SplitPane`. The best we can do if there is no stage is to skip clipped rendering (as if the clipping area was zero, eg return false from `clipBegin`). This isn't terribly useful but is probably better than crashing, doesn't impact existing code, and the ugliness it adds isn't too much, so I'm OK with it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/511831935/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2486292431,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ4NjI5MjQzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2486292431","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"17b9dc1297a627848aa5777c376c65e6b59434cf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/17b9dc1297a627848aa5777c376c65e6b59434cf","created_at":"2019-07-16T14:08:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/512214336","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5711#issuecomment-512214336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5711","id":512214336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMjIxNDMzNg==","user":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-17T11:27:43Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T11:27:43Z","body":"Just a heads up on thism I was able to reproduce the issue, it was a bug in my code.
