#5814 \r\n\r\nTo support iOS Split screen, the only required change is to calculate the graphics bounds using the iOS window object instead of the screen. Any app that doesn't want to support split screen just has to add the `UIRequiresFullScreen` flag to their `Info.plist`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to changing that, there's several things related to it that have been improved.\r\n1. Window is now created and set before libGDX is setup and creates Graphics. This way, when Graphics are created and `computeBounds()` called, `window` is not null.\r\n2. The `window` property on `AppDelegate` is now explicitely set with the main window we set key by calling `uiApp.getDelegate().setWindow(uiWindow)`. In libGDX we keep a reference to this window on `IOSApplication` (called `uiWindow`) but on standard iOS apps it is kept on the `AppDelegate` (in our case `IOSLauncher`) that can access it by calling `getWindow()`. Before this change, calling `getWindow()` from `IOSLauncher` returned `null`. Some more info on the differences between app window and app delegate windows here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21698482/what-is-the-difference-between-uiapplication-sharedapplication-delegate-window-a.\r\n3. There was some code that was added for backwards compatibility for iOS 7- before windows bound sizes and status bar were made device orientation dependent (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24150359/is-uiscreen-mainscreen-bounds-size-becoming-orientation-dependent-in-ios8). Now that the minimum supported iOS version is 8 we can get rid of them.
