If there are newlines, there are multiple runs but `glyphPositions` only contains entries for the first run and you get an exception, as you found.\r\n\r\nI will commit the easiest fix as a stopgap. TextArea is one of the few widgets I did not contribute. I have never needed it in my apps and so I hope others can maintain it. It is maybe a bit odd in that TextField uses GlyphLayout for layout and drawing, while TextArea does its own drawing, line by line. TextArea extends TextField and customizes a few things. Maybe that code reuse is nice, but it probably also makes it a bit fragile.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/386667739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1610332472,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTYxMDMzMjQ3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1610332472","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c2d2313717e90081f79eff7a982f601723be3777","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/c2d2313717e90081f79eff7a982f601723be3777","created_at":"2018-05-04T17:16:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-05T00:07:43Z","updated_at":"2018-05-05T00:07:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5198","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5198/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5198/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5198/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/5198","id":317973474,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTg0Mjk4NDIy","number":5198,"title":"GlyphLayout:

Align.right):\r\n![beforeremovewhitespaceatend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17275393/39301225-a797d65e-494e-11e8-9355-ddb899a7e343.png)\r\n\r\nWith (one) whitespace removed at run end after wrap (with Align.right):\r\n![removewhitespaceatend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17275393/39301295-e043fd3e-494e-11e8-9fca-d7091305c3e2.png)\r\n\r\nWhy after wrap? Because then you can just use peek() and pop() on the arrays and not removeIndex() which has to move whole arrays around.\r\n\r\nIf you scale the font e.g. set font.getData().scaleX = 2; in line 162 of BitmapFontTest and use Align.left, then there is a bug which is fixed by my other pull request:\r\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/5189","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/386821321","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5204#issuecomment-386821321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5204","id":386821321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjgyMTMyMQ==","user":{"login":"EtK2000","id":5119076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTkwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5119076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000","html_url":"https://github.com/EtK2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-05T17:21:20Z","updated_at":"2018-05-05T17:21:20Z","body":"Thanks for the quick fix!\r\nI'll test this soon, but I'd assume you squished this bug.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/386821321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"EtK2000","id":5119076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTkwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5119076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000","html_url":"https://github.com/EtK2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EtK2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1687239204,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2ODcyMzkyMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1687239204","actor":{"login":"Dakror","id":2452821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTI4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2452821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror","html_url":"https://github.com/Dakror","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dakror/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bedfffd7c0cfd4dbd419f2301adb6f794d1aaa08","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Dakror/libgdx/commits/bedfffd7c0cfd4dbd419f2301adb6f794d1aaa08","created_at":"2018-06-18T21:28:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
