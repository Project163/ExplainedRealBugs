So it appears to be just a bug on re-entry for keys that were pressed upon leaving the context since the release is happening outside of the environment.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nIf you ALT+TAB to a window outside of the browser, LibGDX thinks that ALT (and probably the TAB) is still pressed when you return to the LibGDX context. This really can make some keybinds feel sticky and broken.\r\n\r\n**This also makes for some very weird behavior with TextField (and probably heaps of other components)**. For the CONTROL_LEFT pressed down case, TextField CONTROL+A and CONTROL+Z offers specialized functionality, so if you press down CONTROL_LEFT, click another window (lose focus on the LibGDX browser), release CONTROL_LEFT, return to LibGDX context, Gdx.input.isKeyPressed(Input.Keys.CONTROL_LEFT) will return true until you just press/release the bugged key in the LibGDX context.\r\n\r\n**DEMO: https://arenaofkings.com/demo/keydownbug.mp4**\r\nRelevant Code: https://hastebin.com/aqubejebuj.cpp\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.8\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [x] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5134/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
