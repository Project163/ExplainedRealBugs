was trying to understand #5854 issue, so i write a test.\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to understand that project is not the inverse of unproject, there are some Y flips required in between. I thought it was a bug but reading javadoc carefully i understood it was intentional.\r\n\r\nAnyway, during my tests i noticed and fixed few little bugs : \r\n* camera#unproject had a 1 pixel error (propbably a mistake)\r\n* viewport#toScreenCoordinates is only used in GroupTest but this test doesn't show the issue since it use a ScreenViewport (virtual screen bounds are the same as real screen bounds). My test illustrate the issue.\r\n\r\nMy PR doesn't fix #5854 (if there is an issue) but i think the test class i added could be a good base to track it down.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3081510922,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA4MTUxMDkyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3081510922","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-28T10:58:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/592999012","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5854#issuecomment-592999012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5854","id":592999012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Mjk5OTAxMg==","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-29T22:02:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-29T22:11:41Z","body":"Didn't
