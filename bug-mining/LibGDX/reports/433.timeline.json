This is described in the [pack](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/utils/Layout.java#L46-L52) javadocs, as well as why constructors shouldn't call `pack`.\r\n\r\nWhen a Drawable is set, I don't think we ever want to change the Image size as a side effect. I understand it can be a gotcha when using the no-arg Image constructor (or a null drawable), then setting a drawable later AND using the image actor's size rather than pref size, however any time you are using the actor's size and not the pref size you need to take extra care to sizing the actor. If you want the actor size to be the pref size you need to call `pack` after anything that changes the pref size, such as setting a new drawable.\r\n\r\nWe can add javadocs for the no-arg Image constructor to make it a bit more discoverable.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/352327357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1391436762,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM5MTQzNjc2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1391436762","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0409bffda7c0dad56bb5097d23229012423ea0a2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/0409bffda7c0dad56bb5097d23229012423ea0a2","created_at":"2017-12-18T05:12:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
