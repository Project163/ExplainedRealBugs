Issue details\r\nCurrently in `Lwjgl3Application`, when using OpenGL 3.x, we [force GLFW to create the next window](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl3/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/lwjgl3/Lwjgl3Application.java#L492) with the OpenGL set to the Core profile (this behaviour was added in #3932):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (SharedLibraryLoader.isMac) {\r\n  // hints mandatory on OS X for GL 3.2+ context creation, but fail on Windows if the\r\n  // WGL_ARB_create_context extension is not available\r\n  // see: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html\r\n  GLFW.glfwWindowHint(GLFW.GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GLFW.GLFW_TRUE);\r\n  GLFW.glfwWindowHint(GLFW.GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW.GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, I've written some shaders that work fine on Windows (as my development environment) that are happy to work without the Core profile being set, but crash immediately on Mac.\r\n\r\nI'd like to force OpenGL on Windows to use the core profile, too - if that would cause shaders to fail in my dev environment, rather than a poor players' or testers' Mac down the line. (Of course I'm assuming here that my Windows machine has the core profile/extension available, I'm not sure if it does!)\r\n\r\nBut because all of the GLFW hints are done in a package-private `Lwjgl3Application#createGlfwWindow`, I've not been able to find a way to hook into setting these hints before the `CreateWindow` call is eventually called.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to perhaps add a field to Lwjgl3ApplicationConfig, something like `forceGL30CoreProfile` or `forceGL30Compatibility`, that would allow me to force all environments - not just Mac - to use this OpenGL profile? e.g.:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (config.forceGL30Compatibility || SharedLibraryLoader.isMac) {\r\n  // hints mandatory on OS X for GL 3.2+ context creation, but fail on Windows if the\r\n  // WGL_ARB_create_context extension is not available\r\n  // see: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html\r\n  GLFW.glfwWindowHint(GLFW.GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GLFW.GLFW_TRUE);\r\n  GLFW.glfwWindowHint(GLFW.GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW.GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could create a `protected Lwlgl3Application#setupAnyOtherGlfwWindowHints()` that you can call as part of `createGlfwWindow()`, that subclasses could extend.
