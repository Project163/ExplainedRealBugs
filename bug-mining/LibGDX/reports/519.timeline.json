In my opinion, we need a `Gdx.net.downloadImageToPixmap` helper method with two different implementations for GWT and all other backends. It is an easy task using code from GWT backend, but the needed classes and methods are not visible to the core.\r\nEveryone is invited to submit

The Problem\r\nCurrently the way things are set up in the gwt-backend, all files are loaded upon starting the application. Once this is complete, no more files can be loaded due to the way GwtFileHandle is implemented.\r\nThe files available to load through the FileHandle constructor are tied to `com.badlogic.gdx.backends.gwt.preloader.Preloader` class which currently has no api for loading extra files once it has completed the initial load.\r\n\r\n### Potential Solutions\r\n- Expose a `loadAsset` method on the Preloader class which takes a link String and a callback function as arguments\r\n- Add an overload to the `preload` method with an extra argument `String[] extraAssetLinks`\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would prefer the former, although it would require some refactoring to keep the `Preloader ` class DRY, the place where each asset is loaded individually could be extracted into its own function for example.\r\n\r\nI am willing make this change myself, but I was wondering if it was more sensible to simply create a subclass of `Preloader` in my own project
