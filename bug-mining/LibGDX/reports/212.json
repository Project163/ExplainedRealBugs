At the moment, I have to clone the Source Actor and set it as the DragActor, when DragStart set source actor invisible and visible when DragStop.\n\n``` javascript\nDragAndDrop dr = new DragAndDrop();\n        dr.addSource(new Source(imgCross) {\n\n            @Override\n            public Payload dragStart(InputEvent event, float x, float y,\n                    int pointer) {\n                Logger.log(\"start\"); \n                Payload pl = new Payload();\n                pl.setDragActor(imgCross);\n                return pl;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void dragStop(InputEvent event, float x, float y,\n                    int pointer, Payload payload, Target target) {\n                super.dragStop(event, x, y, pointer, payload, target);\n                Logger.log(\"stop\");\n            }\n        });\n```\n\nWith above code, the dragStop is called immediately after 1 call of drag. Because in the removeActor method:\n\n``` javascript\npublic boolean removeActor (Actor actor) {\n        if (!children.removeValue(actor, true)) return false;\n        Stage stage = getStage();\n        if (stage != null) stage.unfocus(actor);\n        actor.setParent(null);\n        actor.setStage(null);\n        childrenChanged();\n        return true;\n    }\n```\n\nWhen DragActor is added to Stage, it will be removed from stage first, so stage.unfocus will be called:\n\n``` javascript\npublic void unfocus (Actor actor) {\n        cancelTouchFocus(actor);\n        if (scrollFocus != null && scrollFocus.isDescendantOf(actor)) scrollFocus = null;\n        if (keyboardFocus != null && keyboardFocus.isDescendantOf(actor)) keyboardFocus = null;\n    }\n```\n\nThe result is stage will cancel touch focus on dragActor, it makes the DragAndDrop call dragStop after 1 call of drag. Old version of libgdx doesn't have this issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
