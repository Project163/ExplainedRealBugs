Here is example based on default gdx-setup project with `gdxVersion = '1.2.1-SNAPSHOT'`.\n\n``` java\npackage com.mygdx.game;\n\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Stage;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.actions.Actions;\nimport com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.ui.Image;\n\npublic class MyGdxGame extends ApplicationAdapter {\n    private Stage stage;\n\n    @Override\n    public void create () {\n        stage = new Stage();\n        final Image image = new Image(new Texture(\"badlogic.jpg\"));\n        stage.addActor(image);\n        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run () {\n                //comment next line for expected behaviour\n                image.clearActions();\n                image.addAction(Actions.moveTo(0, 0, 0.5f));\n            }\n        };\n        image.addAction(Actions.sequence(\n            Actions.moveBy(100, 100, 0.5f),\n            Actions.run(runnable)\n        ));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render () {\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(1, 0, 0, 1);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n        stage.act();\n        stage.draw();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example image is moved to `(100,100)`, end then (should be) moved to `(0, 0)`. But it only moves to `(100,100)` and stays there. \n","closed_by":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
