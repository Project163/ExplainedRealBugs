firstly, you're wrong; my PR didn't add them to backends on purpose (so that everyone can agree on the exact `Input` changes before implementing them in backends), and yousiftouma actually did add them at least to LWJGL backend - and that's still better than nothing.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you miss the main issue. Until you have the keys defined in `Input`, you can't use them in backends. It's completely mandatory to do the preliminary work in the `Input` class beforehand. The PRs weren't accepted for multitude of reasons (well, actually, mine got accepted, but got reverted due to a dumb typo), not implementing changes in backends weren't one of them.\r\n\r\nI've been here for 4 years, and seen those issues from the very beginning.

info on how to add new keycodes:\r\n\r\n* Add the keycodes to `Input.Keys`. If they exist for Android, use same codes as in Android's `KeyEvent` class. If not existant for Android, define a keycode non-clashing with Android's codes and document it as a comment.\r\n* don't forget to define `Input.Keys.toString()` for the new codes\r\n* Android: Due to Android's key code being same than libgdx, no change is needed in Android's backend\r\n* GWT: Changes needed in `DefaultGwtInput.keyForCode()`. GWT's KeyCode.java is incomplete. Check with all browsers and OS at hand (might be slightly different) at https://keycode.info/\r\n* RoboVM: `DefaultIOSInput.getGdxKeyCode()` needs change. Check `UIKeyboardHIDUsage` enum (yes, you can do that on any OS)\r\n* Lwgl: Use `Keyboard` constants in `DefaultLwjglInput.getGdxKeyCode()` and `getLwjglKeyCode()`, Lwjgl3 is similar. Don't forget `LwjglAwtInput`\r\n* CHANGES: Document newly added keycodes and if they are completely new (unmapped before) or changing a mapping existing before\r\n\r\nIf you follow these steps, merge is highly likely.\r\n\r\nFor any controller issues, take a look at the gdx-controllers repo.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/730477319/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/730698512","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5389#issuecomment-730698512","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5389","id":730698512,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMDY5ODUxMg==","user":{"login":"yuripourre","id":1824878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjQ4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1824878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre","html_url":"https://github.com/yuripourre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuripourre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-19T23:19:28Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T23:19:44Z","body":"@MrStahlfelge thank you for providing such useful information.
