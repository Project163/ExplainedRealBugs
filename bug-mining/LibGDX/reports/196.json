Thus on a 160dpi screen this density value will be 1; on a 120 dpi screen it would be .75; etc.\n\nBut on iOS backend it says:\n\n> Returns the display density. @return 1.0f for non-retina devices, 2.0f for retina devices.\n\nUsually programmer works with `Graphics` interface (via `Gdx.graphics`), so without explicit cast to `IOGraphics` he can't see appropriate Javadoc for this method in his IDE. \nI think there are two ways to fix this situation: add iOS-specific note to main Javadoc (not so cool) or to unify behavior of `getDensity()`, so this code running on iPad 2 will return 0.825 etc.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
