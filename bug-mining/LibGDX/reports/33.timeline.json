If any improvements at all then maybe a disclaimer in the javadoc. Also would it ever make sense to be able to pass in an odd number for offset or count since those are X,Y pairs? From that perspective it would maybe make more sense for count and offset to represent the number of points rather than elements. But at the same time maybe what we have is best practice from OpenGL. In any case i lost a few hours on this one and thought maybe it will help someone down the line since debugging this method is extremely taxing to debug. Your profile says that you are in Zagreb?
