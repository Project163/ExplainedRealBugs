gone through our Android Music implentation and checked against MediaPlayer docs (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer) and I've been able to make some tweaks that fix some of our long standing issues (such as #3935).\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n- `seekTo(0)` call has been removed from `stop()` and it's the line that caused #3935. This is not needed as stop() already resets the position indirectly as to play it again, `prepare()` must be called. The commit that added it is ec5ab7a323941c441acf724865cf961771a4a41e , @NathanSweet any idea what it fixed? On 2011 some Android devices had all kinds of strange issues and this might have been a workaround for one of them.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: Found the probable cause for the fix on https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3399 (I'm a fish, it's a good thing I let stuff written for my future me). The SO links point to Froyo problems so it should be safe to remove.\r\n\r\n- Removed `isPlaying()` checks from `play()` and `pause()`. According to the documentation calling `play()` when player is on Play state or `pause()` when it's on Pause state has no effect so we avoid an unnecessary JNI call but I think there's a more important thing it fixes. According to the docs :\r\n\r\n`Note that the transition from the Started state to the Paused state and vice versa happens asynchronously in the player engine. It may take some time before the state is updated in calls to isPlaying(), and it can be a number of seconds in the case of streamed content.`\r\n\r\nThis means that if we we have a paused Music and call `play()` and `pause()` in a short interval of time, it may happen that on the `pause()` call, the `isPlaying()` check returns `false` and the method is not executed.\r\n- Improvements to the `MusicTest` that was impossible to run on a device where everything looked tiny.\r\n\r\nPlaying with the `MusicTest`, hammering buttons, positions slider, etc... on a real device (Samsung S7) I haven't been able to break it while before it was pretty easy to make it fail.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6472/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4626806152,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDYyNjgwNjE1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/4626806152","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"1fd464ad31a4ebe5993f5e0759d0805ef591bbfc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/1fd464ad31a4ebe5993f5e0759d0805ef591bbfc","created_at":"2021-04-21T19:12:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12241265935,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAFH-b84IbWjSzwAAAALZouUP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/12241265935","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1fd464ad31a4ebe5993f5e0759d0805ef591bbfc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/VaTTeRGeR/libgdx/commits/1fd464ad31a4ebe5993f5e0759d0805ef591bbfc","created_at":"2024-03-25T21:53:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
