We should probably start new developers off on the right foot by having the minimum requirements in the generated iOS app, so they can start developing instead of troubleshooting the setup. I'll make a PR to improve this if I have time, just documenting the idea right now.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n- Download libgdx setup app\n- Create basic ios project\n- Build with gradle task createIPA\n- Attempt to submit to app store\n\nUpload fails:\n- Missing 64 bit support\n- No minimum iOS version set\n- Error about multitasking config\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.93\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [X] iOS (robovm)\n","closed_by":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
