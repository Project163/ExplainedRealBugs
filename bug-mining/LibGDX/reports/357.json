The issue is not fixed.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\n```\n    for(int i=0; i<360; i++) {\n        float angle = new Matrix4().rotate(Vector3.Y, i).getRotation(new Quaternion(), true).getAngleAround(Vector3.Y);\n        System.out.printf(\"%.2f -> %.2f \\n\", (float) i, angle);\n    }\n```\n\nYou can clearly see that after 239, angles aren't correct.\n\nQuaternion.getYaw seems to return correct values, so it seems that generated quaternion is set correctly, the problem is with Quaternion.getAngleAroundRad method\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\nlibgdx-nightly-20160516\n","closed_by":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
