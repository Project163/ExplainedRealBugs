I'm having some problems with calling InputMultiplexer.clear() and I think this fix is what messes it up because when I set the input as handled in my inputProcessor and return true, the processors.end() is never called and the _iterating_ field in the DelayedRemovalArray just keeps increasing in every key:\r\n```\r\nprocessors.begin();\r\nfor (int i = 0, n = processors.size; i < n; i++)\r\nif (processors.get(i).keyDown(keycode)) return true;\r\nprocessors.end();\r\n```\r\nWe could add processors.end() before returning true here, but  if @PokeMMO in his example handled the input and  added return true after \r\n```\r\nmultiplexer.removeProcessor(processor1);\r\n```\r\nthe multiplexer would remove the processor and break the loop anyway,
