I'll try to look into those issues in the next couple days, time permitting.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/70396627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sindisil","id":6267121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjcxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6267121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil","html_url":"https://github.com/Sindisil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sindisil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":220599026,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyMDU5OTAyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/220599026","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0358e23be9cf480bfb1fecf1a5c28cc226956e9b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/0358e23be9cf480bfb1fecf1a5c28cc226956e9b","created_at":"2015-01-18T05:11:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/70396891","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2475#issuecomment-70396891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2475","id":70396891,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzk2ODkx","user":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-18T05:12:51Z","updated_at":"2015-01-18T05:12:51Z","body":"@Sindisil Thanks for the PR, fixed it up so the log displayed correctly.
