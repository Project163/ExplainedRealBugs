I found this bug only recently as a silent crash. The fix is relatively simple, just need to check if the `count + offset` is greater than the total number of indicies in the buffer.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nMake a mesh that says it has more indicies than were created.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nAll versions?\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [X] Android\r\n- [X] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [X] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [X] HTML/GWT\r\n- [X] Windows\r\n- [X] Linux\r\n- [X] MacOS","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
