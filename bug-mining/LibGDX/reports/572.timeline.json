Maybe my mac is faster? I have a Mac mini M1 2020. Do you maybe have any minimal reproducer project?\r\n\r\n> At this time the next view controller needs to be setup already.\r\nIs this documented somewhere? Haven't found anything in the apple docs.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, by looking through the docs it seems like there would be nothing speaking against hooking up the controller initialization in the willFinishLaunching event (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623032-application?language=objc). Would you be able to test, whether this fixes the issue for you?\r\n\r\n> The ApplicationListener.create() method as well as the completion of the OpenGL setup are called **after** didFinishLaunching().\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, not precisly. They are called during the \"didFinishLaunching\" callback. Also, according to the docs, \"This method is called after state restoration has occurred but before your app’s window and other UI have been presented. At some point after this method returns, the system calls another of your app delegate’s methods to move the app to the active (foreground) state or the background state.\" \r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application?language=objc\r\nSo the app seems to be not expected to have something already drawn, at this point.\r\n\r\nBut interesting in the code is also this:\r\n```java\r\n\tpublic void viewWillAppear (boolean arg0) {\r\n\t\tsuper.viewWillAppear(arg0);\r\n\t\t// start GLKViewController even though we may only draw a single frame\r\n\t\t// (we may be in non-continuous mode)\r\n\t\tsetPaused(false);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nSo maybe \"setPaused\" was working different in GLKit than in MGLKit? But thats also just a random idea, can't test around without being able to reproduce it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/1216870194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Berstanio","id":25866590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODY2NTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25866590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio","html_url":"https://github.com/Berstanio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Berstanio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/1217123388","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6971#issuecomment-1217123388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6971","id":1217123388,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFH-b85Ii9Q8","user":{"login":"CoderBaron","id":20406457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDA2NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20406457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron","html_url":"https://github.com/CoderBaron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-16T20:25:19Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T20:25:19Z","body":"The ApplicationListener.create() method is called during the first draw call of the view controller:\r\n\r\nIOSGraphics.java\r\n```\r\n\tpublic void draw (GLKView view, CGRect rect) {\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t\tif (!created) {\r\n\t\t\t// OpenGL glViewport() function expects backbuffer coordinates instead of logical coordinates\r\n\t\t\tgl20.glViewport(0, 0, screenBounds.backBufferWidth, screenBounds.backBufferHeight);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tString versionString = gl20.glGetString(GL20.GL_VERSION);\r\n\t\t\tString vendorString = gl20.glGetString(GL20.GL_VENDOR);\r\n\t\t\tString rendererString = gl20.glGetString(GL20.GL_RENDERER);\r\n\t\t\tglVersion = new GLVersion(Application.ApplicationType.iOS, versionString, vendorString, rendererString);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tupdateSafeInsets();\r\n\t\t\tapp.listener.create();\r\n\t\t\tapp.listener.resize(getWidth(), getHeight());\r\n\t\t\tcreated = true;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t...\r\n```\r\nI managed to move all that stuff into the didFinishLaunching method in a local fork to make:\r\n\r\nIOSApplication.java\r\n```\r\n\tfinal boolean didFinishLaunching (UIApplication uiApp, UIApplicationLaunchOptions options) {\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t\tthis.uiWindow.setRootViewController(this.graphics.viewController);\r\n\t\tthis.graphics.updateSafeInsets();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tGdx.app.debug(\"IOSApplication\", \"created\");\r\n\r\n\t\t// make sure the OpenGL view has contents before displaying it\r\n\t\tthis.graphics.view.display();\r\n\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis entirely removes the black/empty frames after the launch screen.

PR changes the iOS backend to have completely setup OpenGL and call `ApplicationListener.create()` within the `UIApplicationDelegate.didFinishLaunching()` method. Before this PR it was lazily done on the first draw call from `GLKView`.\r\n\r\nOnce `didFinishLaunching()` returns iOS starts a fading transition from the launch screen to the root view controller. Without this change the root view controller has no contents yet and will therefore display black frames. Please see the following gifs for comparison on the default libGDX app. It is more noticeable if you have more resources to load for your first screen.\r\n\r\n[Before](https://media.giphy.com/media/ySB9B0QY9r9MUL12db/giphy.gif)\r\n[After](https://media.giphy.com/media/2h5zI1BY87NQL4fxYF/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\nOne important note: With this change all code inside `ApplicationListener.create()` and `resize()` will block the return of `didFinishLaunching()`. Apple has a time limit of a few seconds before the code must have executed otherwise it will terminate the application. So developers should only load necessary resources for the first app screen and offload any heavy stuff for later (like `AssetManager.update()` inside the render method). This recommendation is not new but blocking the render thread for 10 seconds after `didFinishLaunching()` will at least not crash the app.\r\n\r\nFixes #6971 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/1217178933","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6971#issuecomment-1217178933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6971","id":1217178933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFH-b85IjK01","user":{"login":"CoderBaron","id":20406457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDA2NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20406457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron","html_url":"https://github.com/CoderBaron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoderBaron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-16T21:21:42Z","updated_at":"2022-08-16T21:21:50Z","body":"> Maybe it is cleaner to move the view initialization code into a callback like view[Will/Did]Appear, if this works too?\r\n\r\nThose callbacks are called too late.

Issue details\r\n\r\nI've been facing an issue on iOS only when using `FrameBuffer`. When I ported my game [October Bro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bsautermeister.jump) from Android/Desktop to iOS, I noticed that my game screen was just black (or just the screen-clear color I used).\r\n\r\nAfter longer investigation and digging into the LibGdx code, I could figure out the problem, and come up with a workaround. And my hope is that this issue report turns into a simple fix PR (either by me or by you), so that my workaround will not be needed anymore.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n\r\nUse the following code on iOS, and toggle the `FIX` flag.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyGdxGame extends ApplicationAdapter {\r\n\r\n\tprivate static final boolean FIX = true; // <-- please toggle me! :)\r\n\r\n\tSpriteBatch batch;\r\n\tTexture img;\r\n\r\n\tFrameBuffer frameBuffer;\r\n\r\n\tOrthographicCamera camera;\r\n\r\n\tboolean created = false;\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void create () {\r\n\t\tbatch = new SpriteBatch();\r\n\t\timg = new Texture(\"badlogic.jpg\");\r\n\r\n\t\tcamera = new OrthographicCamera();\r\n\r\n\t\tcreated = true;\r\n\t\tframeBuffer = new FrameBuffer(Pixmap.Format.RGBA8888, Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight(), false);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void render () {\r\n\t\tGdx.gl.glClearColor(1f, 0f, 0f, 1);\r\n\t\tGdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\r\n\r\n\t\tIntBuffer oldFbo = BufferUtils.newIntBuffer(1);\r\n\t\tGdx.gl.glGetIntegerv(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING, oldFbo);\r\n\r\n\t\tframeBuffer.begin();\r\n\r\n\t\tGdx.gl.glClearColor(0f, 1f, 1f, 1);\r\n\t\tGdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\r\n\r\n\t\tcamera.setToOrtho(true, frameBuffer.getWidth(), frameBuffer.getHeight());\r\n\t\tcamera.update();\r\n\r\n\t\tGdx.gl.glClearColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 255 / 255.0f);\r\n\r\n\t\tbatch.begin();\r\n\t\tbatch.draw(img, 0, 0);\r\n\t\tbatch.end();\r\n\r\n\t\tframeBuffer.end();\r\n\r\n\t\tif (FIX) {\r\n\t\t\t// use the previous back buffer index, instead of defaultFramebufferHandle from GLFrameBuffer#unbind()\r\n\t\t\tint fboIdx = oldFbo.get();\r\n\t\t\tGdx.gl.glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fboIdx);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tcamera.setToOrtho(true, Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight());\r\n\t\tcamera.update();\r\n\r\n\t\t// render pixel-art buffer to screen\r\n\t\tbatch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);\r\n\t\tbatch.begin();\r\n\t\tbatch.draw(frameBuffer.getColorBufferTexture(),\r\n\t\t\t\t0, 0, 0, 0, Gdx.graphics.getWidth() / 2f, Gdx.graphics.getHeight() / 2f, 1f, 1f, 0f, 0, 0,\r\n\t\t\t\tframeBuffer.getWidth(), frameBuffer.getHeight(), false, true);\r\n\t\tbatch.end();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void dispose () {\r\n\t\timg.dispose();\r\n\t\tbatch.dispose();\r\n\t\tif (frameBuffer != null) {\r\n\t\t\tframeBuffer.dispose();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problematic code seems to come from the following section, which seems to even try to exactly this iOS specific problem according to the comment:\r\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/9036b801cc3f4844d346dc96bf9b8f89d8390ad0/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/glutils/GLFrameBuffer.java#L128-L138\r\n\r\nHowever, while testing and debugging this, I could observe the following:\r\n- As written in these lines, the screen is always `fboIdx = defaultFramebufferHandle = 0` on Desktop/Android, but usually `fboIdx = 1` on iOS\r\n- However, that might depend on the game. Or on the point in time when the `new FrameBuffer(...)` constructor is called for the first time. I observed on my single iOS game that the very first time the constructor is called, that the stored fboIndex is first `0`, and later it would be `1` on iOS.\r\n- The fact that via the static `defaultFramebufferHandleInitialized` the initialization of the `defaultFramebufferHandle` is only done once causes the problem that we **might try to go back to the wrong index** on `FrameBuffer#end()`. As shown in the above code example.\r\n\r\n#### TL;DR Workaround\r\n\r\nSummarizing my current workaround in a brief from above, the problem can be prevented by wrapping the `frameBuffer` begin/end function with:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\nIntBuffer oldFbo = BufferUtils.newIntBuffer(1);\r\nGdx.gl.glGetIntegerv(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING, oldFbo);\r\n\r\nframeBuffer.begin();\r\n// ...\r\nframeBuffer.end();\r\n\r\nint fboIdx = oldFbo.get();\r\nGdx.gl.glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fboIdx);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo kind of override the internal behavior of how `FrameBuffer#end()` does the unbind to go back to the screen.\r\n\r\n#### Version of libGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n`gdxVersion = '1.12.0'`\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots\r\n\r\nWith both `FIX=false` or `FIX=true`, there is no problem on Android/Desktop:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"752\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-09 at 1 33 23 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/assets/2537736/c662a250-3005-430d-b88e-0f690b816738\">\r\n\r\nHowever, on iOS, using `FIX=false` causes a wrong result:\r\n\r\n![Simulator Screenshot - iPhone 15 - 2023-12-09 at 13 32 31](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/assets/2537736/8e6f218d-fac8-452f-8174-57bc1cea2342)\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `FrameBuffer#end()` does **not** work as expected.\r\n\r\nWith my fix to enforce going back to the previous frame buffer (here: the screen), it works correctly on **any** platform, even iOS:\r\n\r\n![Simulator Screenshot - iPhone 15 - 2023-12-09 at 13 33 00](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/assets/2537736/0356d594-f55a-428d-bf69-f36610610cf3)\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [x] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] macOS\r\n\r\n#### References:\r\n\r\n- [FBO bug in Cocos2D](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11617013/why-would-glbindframebuffergl-framebuffer-0-result-in-blank-screen-in-cocos2d)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/7297/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/7297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
