We have written a custom model loader that parses this out into models.\n\nWe use a `Matrix4` to extract the individual components out and set it to the model, like so.\n\n``` java\n            Matrix4 nodeMatrixCache = new Matrix4();\n\n            //Convert to column order. node.matrix.matrix is a float array of size 16\n            nodeMatrixCache.set(node.matrix.matrix).tra();\n\n            final Vector3 translation = new Vector3();\n            final Vector3 scale = new Vector3();\n            final Quaternion rotation = new Quaternion();\n\n            nodeMatrixCache.getRotation(rotation, true);\n            nodeMatrixCache.getTranslation(translation);\n            nodeMatrixCache.getScale(scale);\n\n            modelNode.rotation = rotation;\n            modelNode.scale = scale;\n            modelNode.translation = translation;\n```\n\nWe are using the exact same code for multiple assets, and all are loading perfectly fine, except for one. The matrix is `[-0.003857 -2.209997 0.000000 0.000000  0.000000 0.000000 2.210000 0.012000  -2.209997 0.003858 0.000000 0.000000  0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000]` (in row-major order). \n\nThis one particular asset gives a rotation of `[-0.49956352 0.22691926 0.5004361 0.49956352]` when we extract the rotation.\n\nHowever, if we convert the collada to G3DJ, the rotation that we see in the node is `[-0.499563 0.500436 0.500436 0.499563]`. Index 1 of the rotation matrix has a drastically different value, and it's screwing up the model's rotation when it appears.\n\nAny idea what the problem could be?\n\nP.S: The reason we are not using G3DB is because we need to stream the assets from the network, so we have a custom format that is much smaller than G3DB.\n","closed_by":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
