The `com.apple.*` packages were deprecated in Java 9, and as-of [Java 16](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/396), the JDK will throw an `IllegalAccessError` when calling (if using default settings).\r\n\r\nThese APIs are scheduled to become completely unusable in [JDK17](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/403).\r\n\r\nWhile OpenJDK offers the AWT-based Desktop API to replace this functionality, it's not usable for the lwjgl3 backend on macos. Calling `Desktop.getDesktop()` is enough to initialize the AWT event thread and causes any lwjgl3-based application to instantly hang, The LWJGL project often suggests using the [awt headless property](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/issues/306#issuecomment-300481571) to workaround this issue, but this is nonsensical for the Desktop API's usage.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.10+\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalAccessError: class com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl3.Lwjgl3Net (in unnamed module @0x1f3f4916) cannot access class com.apple.eio.FileManager (in module java.desktop) because module java.desktop does not export com.apple.eio to unnamed module @0x1f3f4916\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PokeMMO","id":2398581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTg1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2398581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO","html_url":"https://github.com/PokeMMO","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PokeMMO/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
