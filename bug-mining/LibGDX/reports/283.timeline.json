Should be fixed now, you can now override the `disposeColorTexture` method and take ownership from that point on. The general rule of thumb is: if you create it, you dispose it. I don't think that encouraging changing (attaching/detaching) ownership is a good idea.\n\nIt would be possible to accept a Texture in the constructor and thus move ownership completely out of the FrameBuffer. But that would get messy when the texture isn't managed (currently the texture is recreated on context loss).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/128095184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/128153637","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3324#issuecomment-128153637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3324","id":128153637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODE1MzYzNw==","user":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-05T21:25:05Z","updated_at":"2015-08-05T21:25:05Z","body":"Thanks
