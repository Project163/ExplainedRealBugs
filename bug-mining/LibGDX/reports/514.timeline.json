Why is one named with the angle unit, and not the other?\r\n\r\nI agree `angleDeg` would have been a better name although, from my experience, I don't think deprecating `angle` just for this reason would get enough support considering libGDX history on how it deals with backwards compatibility and deprectation PRs. Feel free to submit a PR though.\r\n\r\n> Result range. Why is one always positive, and not the other?\r\n\r\nI don't see an issue that \"degrees methods\" return in the range between `[0, 360]` and \"radians methods\" between `[-Math.Pi, Math.Pi]` because either you work with one or the other (and if you need converting it's trivial). It's simply a convention, it's common to use the `[-Math.Pi, Math.Pi]` range when working with polar coordinates.\r\nWhat I agree is that consistency should be required for all methods with the same unit, so, ALL degrees methods should return in the `[0, 360]` range and ALL radians methods in the `[-Math.Pi, Math.Pi]`. Currently this is not the case (`Vector2.angle` and `Vector2.angle(Vector2 reference)` return in different ranges).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/426247838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/426269388","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5388#issuecomment-426269388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5388","id":426269388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjI2OTM4OA==","user":{"login":"jcornaz","id":2535178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzUxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2535178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz","html_url":"https://github.com/jcornaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcornaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T13:16:35Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T13:32:26Z","body":">Currently this is not the case (Vector2.angle and Vector2.angle(Vector2 reference) return in different ranges)\r\n\r\nThis is indeed way much worse.

If no source of a \"convention\" can be found, then it is not a very good spread convention but more a personal preference.\r\n\r\nHere's some random sources of conventions:\r\n* Java conventions: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf\r\n* Kotlin code-style conventions: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html\r\n* Vector representation conventions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector?section=8#Representations\r\n* Sign conventions in math: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics)#Sign_convention\r\n* Human names conventions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Naming_conventions\r\n\r\nI could continue this endless list, but that's not the point. The point is : \"Well established conventions have written sources\"\r\n\r\nAnd about \"just ask anybody how they usually work in 2D geometry\": I studied 4 years and worked full-time 2 years in the domain of 2D geometry. I'm not able to remember such convention.

But (I think) it is a good clue that the \"convention\" you mentioned either doesn't exist or is not that strong. Otherwise it would have been harder to find examples in such popular frameworks. But I know this is no proof. That's why I asked you to source your statement, which is the only way to *prove* the existence of such convention.\r\n\r\nBe also aware that I found theses links by genuinely looking for confirmation of your statement. I thought that this convention could be confined to the video-game world, which would have explained my misunderstanding of the subject. But it doesn't seem to be the case. Or at least I haven't found a good source of it.\r\n\r\nAnd also notice that my example with unity, was the exact equivalent of the function we are currently talking about. It was not an exotic documentation talking about something else. (my example with UE4 was not the exact equivalent, because I failed to find the equivalent. If you find it, please share it)\r\n\r\nPlease read the documentation you shared for unity as well. It talk about input, not output and doesn't mention the range.

we all agree that there are inconsistent APIs behaviour.\r\n\r\nSo there are 2 approaches that are discussed here:\r\n1. In next version - deprecate old APIs and introduce newer ones\r\n    a. In next version + 1 - remove the deprecated APIs\r\n    b. (optional) in next version + 2 - rename the new APIs to the old APIs naming\r\n2. Change the behavior of the inconsistent API\r\n\r\nI find first approach more constructive and more appealing as per backward compatibility aspects for the consumers of the inconsistent API.\r\nFirst approach will clearly state in compile time what and how to adapt (given all Javadoc is in place), whether the second approach will just break the consumer.\r\nWdyt?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\nOn another note, point 1b might be problematic for consumers that upgrading from this version or lower to the next version +2 - they will fall into the same trap of a hidden breaking change, if they don't read the release notes of each version and version carefully.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/427554417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"genrym","id":12461722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDYxNzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12461722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym","html_url":"https://github.com/genrym","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genrym/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1928377339,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5MjgzNzczMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/1928377339","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5b68a5c7ece49328aa9008eb29c1eb0c925955be","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obigu/libgdx/commits/5b68a5c7ece49328aa9008eb29c1eb0c925955be","created_at":"2018-10-26T09:41:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-26T09:45:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T09:45:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5428","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5428/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5428/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5428/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/5428","id":374306597,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI2MDM3MTcz","number":5428,"title":"Fix #5388.

Made `angle(Vector2)` consistent to `angle()` to return values in the [0, 360) range.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3720369528,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzcyMDM2OTUyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3720369528","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-02T15:16:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3720369853,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MjAzNjk4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3720369853","actor":{"login":"obigu","id":1794492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu","html_url":"https://github.com/obigu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obigu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1fc7cd427a021ff6f02e1d698d711362adc99cac","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/1fc7cd427a021ff6f02e1d698d711362adc99cac","created_at":"2020-09-02T15:16:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
