I have been able to reproduce the issue on a Samsung Galaxy S7. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately disabling gestures doesn't fix it and has been reported previously by other users always affecting Samsung devices:\r\n\r\nThe key issue as described by another user is that as soon as the palm is down an ACTION_CANCEL occurs (with several [ViewRootImpl] action cancel -1 logs displayed) and the app cannot properly clean up the touch-point records because the ACTION_UP or ACTION_POINT_UP events will not be received.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25492112/motionevent-action-cancel-is-blocking-subsequent-action-up-on-my-button\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45281345/android-studio-d-viewrootimpl-viewrootimpl-action-cancel\r\nhttps://developer.samsung.com/forum/thread/a/201/271485\r\n\r\nThe only workaround I can think of is to clear all touches if an ACTION_CANCEL is received but I'm not sure about the consequences and if ACTION_CANCEL is triggered in other situations.\r\n\r\n***EDIT*** Reading the documentation it seems that ACTION_CANCEL means the entire gesture is cancelled so I guess it makes sense to clear all other
