Even on integrated graphics, CaveCops can get over 200 FPS, so the LWJGL3 code running at 54 FPS on a high-end gaming machine is concerning to me. I think @Ktar5 can test with vsync enabled on a machine with a 144Hz monitor; if that goes from 144 FPS on LWJGL2 to 54FPS on LWJGL3, that sounds like a significant bug.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/548195330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2758284720,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1ODI4NDcyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2758284720","actor":{"login":"Ktar5","id":1613876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1613876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5","html_url":"https://github.com/Ktar5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T02:52:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2758284721,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTgyODQ3MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2758284721","actor":{"login":"Ktar5","id":1613876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1613876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5","html_url":"https://github.com/Ktar5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T02:52:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/548225850","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5826#issuecomment-548225850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5826","id":548225850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODIyNTg1MA==","user":{"login":"Ktar5","id":1613876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1613876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5","html_url":"https://github.com/Ktar5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-31T05:47:39Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T05:47:39Z","body":"In

Issue details\r\nI am making an LibGdx build using the Lwjgl3 backend 'gdx-backend-lwjgl3'.\r\nI am using Kotlin.\r\n\r\nWhen I run the desktop application (after enabling vsync) in windowed mode, the CPU is about 1-2%.\r\nWhen I switch it to fullscreen with an Alt+Enter toggle I created, the task manager says that\r\nthe java process is taking up to 50%. I have a multi-monitor desktop, so I can look at both.\r\nAlso, when in fullscreen, the FPS seems unlimited, as the logger show it going above 4,000\r\ndespite the fact that my Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration has vsync set to true.\r\n\r\nIf I force it to use vsync after it goes to fullscreen (Using Gdx.graphics.setVsync(true) ), the logger says that the fps is at 60, but the CPU utilization does not go down.\r\n\r\nWhen the is windowed, but stretched to fill most of the screen, the cpu utilization is still low.\r\nThis only happens when it goes to fullscreen  or starts in fullscreen.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n1) Clone build  here: https://github.com/Anti-Alias/pokemaker-core\r\n\r\n2) Run application in cmd or git bash using:\r\ngradlew desktop:run\r\nor\r\n./gradlew desktop:run\r\n\r\n3) Open task manager on a Windows machine and note the cpu usage.\r\n\r\n3) Press Alt+Enter and notice change in task manager's cpu usage for that java process.\r\nYou will need at least two monitors to test this.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nLibGdx version:     1.9.7\r\ngdx backend:        gdx-backend-lwjgl3 : 1.9.7\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\nWindows 10\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3707560611,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MDc1NjA2MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/3707560611","actor":{"login":"crykn","id":8125827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjU4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8125827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn","html_url":"https://github.com/crykn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f425e62751f5be17319b20169bebc6e34c4fc174","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crykn/libgdx/commits/f425e62751f5be17319b20169bebc6e34c4fc174","created_at":"2020-08-30T19:26:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"crykn","id":8125827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjU4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8125827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn","html_url":"https://github.com/crykn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-30T19:58:20Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T19:58:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6150","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6150/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6150/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6150/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6150","id":688781153,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDc1OTU2MDc2","number":6150,"title":"Set
