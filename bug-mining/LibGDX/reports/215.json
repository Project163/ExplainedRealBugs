Wasn't it supposed to compare which one is higher and then set it?\n\nFor example, I have 2 widgets left and right (vertical = false)  and both is a label (equal height).  if each one have a prefHeight of 20 (for example)  the spliter prefHeight will be 40 and the table will grow even more.\n\nThe left image is whats happening and the right is when I remove the add sign.\n\n![splitprefheight](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6472084/6433263/0c7f1a24-c049-11e4-9c4e-8cc3fd88aae1.png)\n\n```\nif (secondWidget != null)\n{\n    float tmpHeight = secondWidget instanceof Layout ?
