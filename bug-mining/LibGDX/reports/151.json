Use gdx-setup.jar to generate new project. Import core, desktop and android project into Eclipse.\n2. At core project, implement InputProcessor into ApplicationAdapter (MyGdxGame) and add missing method.\n3. On create method, set InputProcessor ( Gdx.input.setInputProcessor(this) ) and set it to null at dispose method.\n4. Now, build android project into your device.\n5. Dont run your app from Home Screen, go to Drawer and run app.\n6. When first screen is shown (with red background and bad-ass logic game logo), tap screen 1 time - ONLY 1 time.\n7. Press back key, app will be exit and we will go to drawer screen.\n8. Press home key, and:\n- we will have focus on Drawer icon (my Nexus 5 android 4.4)\n- Google text on search box will be focus (my LG LTE 2 android 4.1)\n\n![device-2014-10-06-141321](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5146176/4522417/4ffbfa7c-4d28-11e4-9bc5-ac741b5f4dfe.png)\n","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2421/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
