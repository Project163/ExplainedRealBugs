My code to do this was working just fine yesterday so one of the recent nightly builds broke it.\n\nHere is some example code:\n\nTest Class:\n\npublic class jsonNullTest {\n    jsonNullTest() {\n\n```\n}\n```\n\n}\n\nMethod creating an array of this test class, adding one value of the array as null, and another is the object of the test class. This then converts my array to json, then I am decoding it and I get the error.\n\npublic static void jsonTest()\n    {\n        jsonNullTest[] testArray = new jsonNullTest[2];\n\n```\n    jsonNullTest testClass = new jsonNullTest();\n    testArray[0] = testClass;\n    testArray[1] = null;\n    Json json = new Json();\n    String testClassData = json.toJson(testArray);\n\n    jsonNullTest test = json.fromJson(jsonNullTest.class, testClassData);\n    Gdx.app.log(TAG, \n```\n\n}\n\nRunning the above will produce the following error:\n\nException in thread \"LWJGL Application\" com.badlogic.gdx.utils.SerializationException: Unable to convert value to required type: [\n{},\n\"null\"\n](com.tucson.mygame.utils.jsonNullTest)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Json.readValue(Json.java:896)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Json.fromJson(Json.java:693)\n    at com.tucson.mygame.utils.LevelSerializer.jsonTest(LevelSerializer.java:167)\n    at com.tucson.mygame.screens.MenuScreen.<init>(MenuScreen.java:46)\n    at com.tucson.mygame.mygameGame.create(mygameGame.java:25)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication.mainLoop(LwjglApplication.java:136)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication$1.run(LwjglApplication.java:114)\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
