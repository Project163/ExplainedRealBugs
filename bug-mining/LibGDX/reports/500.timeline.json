I hope there's a way to run the added code conditionally, but I don't really understand heaps that well.\r\n\r\nWhat my code does is run part of `up()` near the end of `down()`, because in the current libGDX code, methods like `remove()` swap the last node with the removed node *even if* the new position for the last node isn't valid by the heap property. Filtering up as well as down ensures it's in the right place, but can probably be optimized.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/605549616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/605631897","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5984#issuecomment-605631897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5984","id":605631897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTYzMTg5Nw==","user":{"login":"windmeup","id":3007853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3007853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup","html_url":"https://github.com/windmeup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windmeup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-29T12:58:00Z","updated_at":"2020-03-29T13:16:44Z","body":"Thank
