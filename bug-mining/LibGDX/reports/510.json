The old way of accessing external files won't work.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't done, and there's an attempt to access external files the way I believe libGDX currently does, Android throws a \"android.os.FileUriExposedException\"\r\n\r\nI ran across this when I was attempting to update [this code here](https://github.com/BenMcLean/gdx-nativefilechooser/blob/master/android/src/main/java/net/spookygames/gdx/nativefilechooser/android/AndroidFileChooser.java) to enable using Android's native file chooser to load user files. The way the code is at the moment has the exception being thrown by code that doesn't actually touch libGDX, but on searching around in libGDX, I am seeing no mention of ever fixing this in any commit, and it's something that would need to be fixed in all Android apps which access external files, therefore I figure that it cannot have been fixed in libGDX. Maybe I'm wrong, but definitely something to look into.\r\n\r\nIf I was to implement FileProvider, I'm not seeing a clear way to presenting the files it gets in the form of a libGDX FileHandle, so I think that's the libGDX-relevant part of this. That's going to be necessary to access external files in Android from now on AFAIK, so at the absolute bare minimum, the [wiki needs updating](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/File-handling) to deal with this change in Android.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, this is definitely not a problem on desktop or any other platform AFAIK. Just Android.\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [X] Android","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
