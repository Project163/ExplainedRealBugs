Compile SDK is **almost independent** (explained later) from minSDK or targetSDK of projects using libGDX and doesn't break backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n**libGDX currently allows minSDK 9**. Android Support libraries do have minSDK requirements and that's what makes libGDX compileSDK not to be fully independent from minSDK. Latest SDKs Support libraries (26.0.0 onwards) require minSDK 14. The latest Support library which allows minSDK 9 is 25.4.0 (https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/rev-archive.html).\r\n\r\n**So, if we want to keep minSDK 9, we can use Android Nougat (Api Level 25) as the new SDK to compile the Android backend**.\r\n\r\nIt would also be interesting as a separate discussion to consider upgrading the minSDK to API Level 14  considering it's only used by 0.4% of active devices.","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5064/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
