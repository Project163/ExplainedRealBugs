The textures used for the glyphs are, OTOH, even about 130px tall.\nb) call `getXHeight()`, `getCapHeight()` or `getAscent()` (the last one based directly on capHeight) and try to use the values returned; it's virtually impossible without first subtracting the padding, since the values will not account for vertical offset created by it. The heights will be about 1.5x-2x the real values, depending on the exact glyph (because they will be based on the texture size, not the actual glyph size).\n\nOTOH, `getDescent()`, `getDown()` & `getBaseline()` are completely correct and usable, since they are based on the raw .fnt data (`lineHeight`, `base=`, `yOffset=`). As a result, you can't determine the actual (usable) xHeight, capHeight & ascent based just on BitmapFont.in this case.\n\nSubtracting the padding returns the correct values pixel-wise, but doing so outside of `BitmapFont` requires a) re-parsing the .fnt, b) manually correcting the returned invalid values mentioned above on every actual usage. Also, I reckon the values returned from BitmapFontData should correspond to commonly used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height#/media/File:Typography_Line_Terms.svg , otherwise they can't be reliably used for anything. Padding is, AFAIK, used by the BMFont editors to signify the need for additional space around the glyph, be it for shadow, glow or any other effect. The `height` of the glyph is corresponding to the (already padded) texture height, which is >= actual glyph height. Adding effects using padding shouldn't affect the actual typographical heights (lines) of the glyphs/font.\n\nBTW, the font was generated by (AFAIK) Hiero, so I can only assume the .fnt data I supplied (and its interpretation) is as right as Hiero is.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/97994021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FyiurAmron","id":11016998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDE2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11016998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron","html_url":"https://github.com/FyiurAmron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/98187869","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3074#issuecomment-98187869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3074","id":98187869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4MTg3ODY5","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-01T17:56:03Z","updated_at":"2015-05-01T17:56:03Z","body":"Thanks. You can see the issue most easily in BitmapFontMetricsTest. I've committed fixes so font metrics are not affected by padding. Some fixes where needed for glyph layout, because glyph width contains padding and glyph xoffset only negates `padLeft`.\n\nI do think the changes are good, but they most likely break all libgdx apps that use fonts with padding -- text will be drawn in a slightly different place and take up less space in both directions. The fastest way to fix this is to go back to the old behavior, which can be done with this:\n\n``` java\n/** Adjusts the font data metrics to not take padding into account. */\nstatic private void includePaddingInMetrics (BitmapFontData fontData) {\n    float padY = fontData.padTop + fontData.padBottom;\n    fontData.xHeight += padY;\n    fontData.capHeight += padY;\n    fontData.ascent -= padY;\n    fontData.descent -= fontData.padBottom;\n    fontData.padTop = 0;\n    fontData.padLeft = 0;\n    fontData.padBottom = 0;\n    fontData.padRight = 0;\n}\n```\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/98187869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":295087137,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk1MDg3MTM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/295087137","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c976f463c3686f6a3a615f2358dc31c25f60ce0d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/c976f463c3686f6a3a615f2358dc31c25f60ce0d","created_at":"2015-05-01T17:56:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/98190107","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3074#issuecomment-98190107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3074","id":98190107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4MTkwMTA3","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-01T18:06:50Z","updated_at":"2015-05-01T18:06:50Z","body":"[Blahrged.](http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=3678)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/98190107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users

yesterday I've updated libgdx from 1.5.2 to 1.7.0 and have noticed some issues with scene2d.ui Labels.\n## Issue 1\n\nMaybe it's intended, maybe not. In 1.7.0 Labels don't have a little space before the first character (actually the part of this character) and after the last one.\n\nPlease, see this example. It's a Label added to a table cell. Compare its left and right boundaries as was in the version 1.5.2 and as is in the version 1.7.0.\n\n![space](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10563821/10561560/54c44096-7536-11e5-8f26-c22ed42d8977.png)\n## Issue 2 - really bizarre one\n\nWhen you add a Label to a table cell and set the width of the latter, some characters may become broken...\n\nHere is an example, where I have a table and add a lot of labels into its cells (like table.add(label).width(columnWidth)). Please, notice some strange artifacts in some characters (especially 'F', '5', '6'). The same thing without setting the width is below -- as you can see, all characters there are rendered correctly. Btw the font is 32px size and pregenerated with FreeTypeFontGenerator.\n\nPlease, click on the image to see it in full size.\n\n![label_artifacts1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10563821/10561589/6325fcb8-7538-11e5-81cf-3f3c6d2040ce.png)\n\nAnother example is with a TextButton and its Label. When simply added to a table, the Label is rendered correctly, but if added followed by fillX(), the artifact appears:\n\n![label_artifacts2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10563821/10561596/e24f3676-7538-11e5-8e6d-d30cd80aee5e.png)\n\nThe font is Lato 2.015 Light
