A single class example is not easy to create. That's why I have tried it in the bullet test collection. I have changed the `BulletWorld.update()` method like this:\n\n```\n@Override\npublic void update () {\n    if (performanceCounter != null) {\n        performanceCounter.tick();\n        performanceCounter.start();\n    }\n    if (collisionWorld instanceof btDynamicsWorld) {\n        ((btDynamicsWorld)collisionWorld).stepSimulation(Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime(), maxSubSteps, fixedTimeStep);\n        btBroadphasePairArray pairArray = ((btDynamicsWorld)collisionWorld).getBroadphase().getOverlappingPairCache().getOverlappingPairArray();\n        for (int i = 0; i < pairArray.size(); i++) {\n            System.out.println(\"Overlapping pairs: \" + pairArray.size());\n            pairArray.at(i);\n        }\n    }\n    if (performanceCounter != null) performanceCounter.stop();\n}\n```\n\nAny bullet test using this will crash. For example the first one (ShootTest) will print `77` and then crash at `pairArray(0)`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
