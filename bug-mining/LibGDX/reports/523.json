When I upgraded to 1.9.0 the iOS version went into a resize loop when I started the game, where resize was being called on every game loop.\n\nThe iOS version now calls resize when a subview is added, this lead my code to destroy and recreate my adview, which then caused resize to be called again on the next loop.\n\nThe thing that makes this look like it might be a bug is that if I returned to the home screen of the iPad and back to the game, this stopped happening.\n","closed_by":{"login":"WillCalderwood","id":6973062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzMwNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6973062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood","html_url":"https://github.com/WillCalderwood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillCalderwood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
