Thanks for submitting a pull request for Destination Sol! :-)\r\nPlease fill in some brief details below about the PR.\r\nIf it contains source code please make sure to do everything in the pre pull request checklist first.\r\nIf you add unit tests we'll love you forever! -->\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nThis pull request updates LibGDX to version 1.9.14.\r\n\r\nTo see what has changed you can view the release notes for interim LibGDX versions:\r\n - [LibGDX 1.9.10](https://libgdx.com/news/2019/07/gdx_1_9_10)\r\n - [LibGDX 1.9.11](https://libgdx.com/news/2020/07/gdx_1_9_11)\r\n - [LibGDX 1.9.12](https://libgdx.com/news/2020/10/gdx_1_9_12)\r\n - [LibGDX 1.9.13](https://libgdx.com/news/2021/01/gdx_1_9_13)\r\n - [LibGDX 1.9.14](https://libgdx.com/news/2021/02/gdx-1-9-14)\r\n\r\nIn terms of breaking LibGDX API changes:\r\n- InputProcessor scrolled method now receives scroll amount for X and Y. Changed type to float to support devices which report fractional scroll amounts. Updated InputEvent in scene2d accordingly: added scrollAmountX, scrollAmountY attributes and corresponding setters and getters ([#6154](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6154)).\r\n- Vector2 angleRad(Vector2) now correctly returns counter-clockwise angles ([#5428](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/5428)).\r\n- getDeltaTime() now returns the raw delta time instead of a smoothed one on Android ([#6228](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6228)).\r\n- Gdx.files.external on Android now uses app external storage ([File handling](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/File-handling)).\r\n- HeadlessApplicationConfiguration#renderInterval was changed to #updatesPerSecond\r\n\r\nThe [`gdx-controllers`](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-controllers) library has changed its versioning, so it no longer shares a version number with its corresponding LibGDX release. The version numbers have therefore been changed in the corresponding gradle files that use them.\r\n\r\nI found that the `libGdxVersion` variable was being defined seperately in two different gradle files, so I removed the variables from `config/gradle/common.gradle` so that they are all defined in the same file (`build.gradle` in the root directory). I assumed that all variables in an `allprojects` block are applied to all sub-projects recursively of the root project.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n- Build the game, which should not display any compile errors.\r\n- Run the game and test things as usual\r\n- If possible, try using all the avaliable input modes (`Keyboard`, `Keyboard+Mouse` and `Controller`)\r\n- If possible, try doing this using both the android and desktop facades\r\n\r\nThis should not require any android changes, as it uses the gradle `gdxVersion` variable rather than hard-coding the version used.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nLibGDX 1.9.13 introduced the foregroundFPS setting for the LWJGL3 back-end, which was previously present in the LWJGL2 back-end. I have not used it for now though as there is no equivalent code for the android back-end.\r\n\r\nThis depends on MovingBlocks/TeraNUI#68, as there can only be one version of LibGDX present on the classpath (and the newer versions have ABI-breaking changes in them).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MovingBlocks/DestinationSol/issues/637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MovingBlocks/DestinationSol/issues/637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
