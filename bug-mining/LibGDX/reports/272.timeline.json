This is why I had to start rounding my own offset values after updating to the new BitmapFont refactor, and why GlyphLayout's centering is causing me issues.\n\nMy new suggestion is to round `gx` and `gy` in the `addToCache` method in BitmapFontCache. There might still be rounding errors with the spacing between glyphs and/or runs, though, so maybe there should be rounding further up the chain!\n\nAnother solution might be to use floor instead of round, but I haven't fully thought that through.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/118406959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dan-fitzgerald-av","id":3443800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDM4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3443800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-fitzgerald-av","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":348081395,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ4MDgxMzk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/348081395","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"cf61e82f828326b709ff83d432f402ec67eca72d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/cf61e82f828326b709ff83d432f402ec67eca72d","created_at":"2015-07-05T18:18:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dan-fitzgerald-av","id":3443800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDM4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3443800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av","html_url":"https://github.com/dan-fitzgerald-av","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dan-fitzgerald-av/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T18:57:03Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T18:57:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3260","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3260/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3260/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3260/events","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3260","id":93350345,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MzM1MDM0NQ==","number":3260,"title":"BitmapFont

I should've debugged better because I just found the actual cause of my previous issue with BitmapFont integer filtering: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3254\n\nIn the constructor for BitmapFont, the method `newFontCache()` uses the boolean field `integer` but that field is set after `newFontCache()` is called, so the BitmapFontCache constructor's integer parameter is always false.\n\nRight now I'm working around it by calling `setUseIntegerPositions()` after the constructor.
