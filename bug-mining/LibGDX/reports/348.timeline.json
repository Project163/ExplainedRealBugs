the original idea wasn't very clean. I am not sure if the `WindowProperty` isn't overengineering though. I don't like bundling it with `setWindowedMode` because when I, for example, decide that I want to make the window non-resizable during the game (there is probably a better example, but bear with me), I'll have to retrieve window's dimensions to supply with the `setWindowedMode` call. Which in turn will do a bunch more work because it resizes the window to the same size it already has.\n\nSo I'd prefer separate setters for all properties. I have been thinking: how many  properties are there and to which backends to they apply? Most of the properties are backend specific:\n- fullscreen - desktop and GWT only\n- window dimensions, title, resizability and decorated - desktop only\n- title bar/\"immersion mode\" - iOS/Android only\n\nmaybe there is more (does cursor count?), but I can't think of them. Some of these are currently as setters in `Application` (`setTitle`), some only in their backend subclasses (`AndroidApplication.useImmersiveMode`) and some can't be specified at all (what was mentioned, title bar on iOS).\n\nJust a thought: Would it be worth it to somehow unify these properties and give them their own setters in `Application`/`Graphics`? That way, they won't do anything on platforms which don't support that property, but working with them in platform agnostic way will be easy. Or we can go in the opposite way and add them only where they are implemented. I like the previous option more though.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/174599956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Darkyenus","id":5280068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODAwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5280068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus","html_url":"https://github.com/Darkyenus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/174609296","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3773#issuecomment-174609296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3773","id":174609296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NDYwOTI5Ng==","user":{"login":"bgroenks96","id":841306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96","html_url":"https://github.com/bgroenks96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgroenks96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-25T18:19:47Z","updated_at":"2016-01-25T18:19:47Z","body":"Do
