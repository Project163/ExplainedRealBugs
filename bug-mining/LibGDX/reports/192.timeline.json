I'm not sure what is the best way to get the desired behavior here... I've been able to accomplish it by drawing twice, the first time with \"clear\" mode, to blow away the existing pixels, the second time with \"source-over\" mode, to draw the new data. This is obviously not super efficient.\n\nIn other news, I think that there is something wrong with fillCircle on the normal (non-GWT) Pixmap when the color is not opaque and blending mode is SourceOver.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1095464/5603257/af01b7e4-9339-11e4-9c15-df374148947a.png)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/68603928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":214667203,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxNDY2NzIwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/214667203","actor":{"login":"davebaol","id":2366334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjYzMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2366334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol","html_url":"https://github.com/davebaol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-01-06T13:32:00Z","label":{"name":"gwt","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":220540688,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwNTQwNjg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/220540688","actor":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"32a8ceb5edf9974f6b1d8e875a314b18edee7cc3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/32a8ceb5edf9974f6b1d8e875a314b18edee7cc3","created_at":"2015-01-17T19:01:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
