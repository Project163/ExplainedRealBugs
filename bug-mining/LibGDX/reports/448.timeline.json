is my first PR...\r\n\r\nWe where having some issues with the color markup + wrapping (issue #4425). So after some debbugging I found the main problem was that the `run.width` wasn't set to 0 after a line break.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tif (wrapIndex == 0) {\r\n\t\tnext = run; // No wrap index, move entire run to next line.\r\n\t\trun.width = 0;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nAlso we found some minor glitches with offsets on the first glyph of every new line.\r\nNot sure what was the intention of the code before. But I think the first character of a new line must be always set to offset 0 (as it works with the first line)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t//xAdvances2.set(0, -glyphs2.first().xoffset * fontData.scaleX - fontData.padLeft);\r\n\txAdvances2.set(0,0);\t// Set first glyph starting at 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso the boolean variable ` colorRun` was breaking some color markup styles (issue #4192). Maybe it's some obsolete code. I removed the colorRun variable and send a false parameter when calling\r\n`fontData.getGlyphs(run, str, runStart, runEnd, false);`\r\n\r\nNow the text is wrapped and colored correctly
