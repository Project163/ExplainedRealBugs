There are some specific effects, though, that require those values to apply to all particles so no solution covers all cases. This applies to all properties, from Rotation to Velocity, not just Life.\r\n\r\nIf I had to design how the Particle Editor works, properties would affect \"Each particle individually\" by default and for extra versatility, a setting/checkbox on each of them would allow to switch to \"All particles\".\r\n\r\nI agree that we must keep the option to set Life property to work as it has worked until now.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 options:\r\n1. We leave current behaviour as default and add a setting to change it to apply particles individually.\r\n2. We change current behaviour and add a checkbox to set it to how it was before.\r\n\r\nOption 1 has the advantage of being fully backwards compatible.\r\nOption 2 has the advantage of consitency across properties and (this is an opinion) that default will be the most common use case.

#5280.\r\n\r\nAdded a new setting (\"Independent\" checkbox) to Life and Life Offset properties that allows that when defining a ranged value it affects each particle independently instead of all particles. The change is backwards compatible with previously created effects which should behave exactly like before.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, it has been quite challenging to add the new setting in a clean way (and it's still not great) due to how the Particle Editor is designed and the rigid particle effects file descriptor format. The 2D Particle system definitely deserves a good refactoring :).\r\n\r\nThere's a link to the new 2D Particle Editor .jar in the issue comments if you want to try it.\r\n\r\nI'll squash changes when I get the Ok.\r\n\r\n**Do changes to the Wiki need to be part of the

\"Life attribute on Particle Emitter is not applied to particles individually\" with ID #5280 broke Particle loader for the HTML/gwt module\r\n\r\n#### Issue details\r\nA new parameter (independent) has been added to the ParticleEffect configuration file \".p\".\r\nIn order to ensure backward compatibility the lifeValue.loader in class ParticleEmitter\r\nhas been updated with a mark(100) followed by a reset (see below).\r\nProblem is,\r\n\r\n- On Desktop, Android, calling that works.\r\n- On GWT this triggers an Exception as there is no implementation for the BuffereredReader.mark() method. This calls by default the method on Reader.java which by default raises an exception.\r\n\r\nIn class ParticleEmitter:\r\n```\r\npublic void load (BufferedReader reader) throws IOException {\r\n\t\t\tsuper.load(reader);\r\n\t\t\t// For backwards compatibility, independent property may not be defined\r\n\t\t\treader.mark(100);\r\n\t\t\tString line = reader.readLine();\r\n\t\t\tif (line == null) throw new IOException(\"Missing value: \" + \"independent\");\r\n\t\t\tif (line.contains(\"independent\"))\r\n\t\t\t\tindependent = Boolean.parseBoolean(readString(line));\r\n\t\t\telse\r\n\t\t\t\treader.reset();\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\n\r\nRun the Out of the box Tests on GWT, select the following test com.badlogic.gdx.tests.ParticleEmitterTest\r\n\r\nYou will get the Exception outlined in the stacktrace section below.\r\n\r\nThe issue does not happen with the android or Desktop module (which is probably why this went undetected).\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n\r\nLibGDX Version: 1.9.9-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n```java\r\nUncaught Error:
