Result range: Why only one of these function returns always positive values, while the 3 others don't?\r\n2. Naming: Why some function are named with the angle unit, and not the others?\r\n\r\n### Proposition:\r\n1. Add `angleDeg()` and `angleDeg(Vetor2)` functions returning *both* values between `[-180, +180]`\r\n2. Deprecate `angle()` and `angle(Vector2)` functions\r\n\r\nThis would make usage of angles in radians and degrees more consistent. Conversions would also be easier, since multiplying by `MathUtils.degreeToRadians` or `MathUtils.radiansToDegree` would always be enough.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps/code\r\n\r\nThis:\r\n```java\r\nSystem.out.println(new Vector.2(0f, -1f).angleDeg()); // -90\r\nSystem.out.println(new Vector.2(0f, -1f).angleRad()); // -Math.PI / 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be preferable to:\r\n```java\r\nSystem.out.println(new Vector.2(0f, -1f).angle()); // 270\r\nSystem.out.println(new Vector.2(0f, -1f).angleRad()); // -Math.PI / 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.8\r\n\r\n### Please select the affected platforms\r\nPlatform is irrelevant here. This is math.
