I see what you mean. I don't think that an asset should depend more than once on another asset though. So I'd say that this is an issue of the model loader. However, the `getDependencies` method does return an `Array`, so perhaps other (custom) loaders have the same problem. That could be fixed by changing it to `ObjectSet`, but that's probably going to break quite some code. Therefor I guess that removing any duplicate dependencies in the `AssetLoadingTask` class might be a good and simple way to fix this. Not sure if that's the best way to deal with this though.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/135523292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/135656756","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3373#issuecomment-135656756","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3373","id":135656756,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTY1Njc1Ng==","user":{"login":"VinceAngel","id":3493075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTMwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3493075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel","html_url":"https://github.com/VinceAngel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceAngel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T06:58:53Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T06:58:53Z","body":"It's
