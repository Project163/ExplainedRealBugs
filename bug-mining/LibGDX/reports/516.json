However, when in fullscreen, these issues would go away and I'd have a beautiful, smooth game. This was a constant bug over the course of time.\r\n\r\nOne of the above issues suggests moving to the LWJGL 3 backend. So I did, and have been testing it over the past week.\r\n\r\nInstead of the odd stuttering, this time around I have FPS / delta time that goes wild, and stays below 60fps, even though my computer (a recent, expensive gaming laptop) is more than capable of hitting 60 fps. It's not only my game doing this, though, it seems all the LWJGL3 games running on my machine experience the same issue. HOWEVER, once again, in fullscreen, the issue doesn't exist at all, for all the games I've tried.\r\n\r\nHere's an interesting gif showing some stats\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9y9e1ZT.gifv\r\n\r\nAnd another of someone else's game in LWJGL3 (same game in lwjgl2 gets smooth 60fps)\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ftbOJ1R.gifv\r\n\r\nHere is another of a LWJGL2 game, which shows the normal, expected behaviour\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/U0QzL5t.gifv\r\n\r\nHere's a paste of a bit of deltaTime printout to show the variation\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/tcxvSt5k\r\n\r\nAnd heres the same printing out of deltaTime in fullscreen:\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/eFiF3J51\r\n\r\nWhen in fullscreen with vsync disabled and fps unlimited, I get over 2400 FPS, which is just something to show that my machine is more than capable of 60fps windowed.\r\n\r\nWe have tried vsync on, vsync off, Display.sync stuff from lwjgl2, manually setting vsync, profiling, and other countless efforts.\r\n\r\nIs there any information you could possibly supply me on this topic?\r\n\r\n**Expected results**\r\nA smooth, consistent FPS in the range of 58-62\r\n\r\n**Version of LibGDX**\r\n1.9.11-SNAPSHOT, LWJGL3 backend\r\n\r\n**Platforms tested on**\r\nWindows\r\n\r\nYes i have the latest drivers.","closed_by":{"login":"Ktar5","id":1613876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM4NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1613876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5","html_url":"https://github.com/Ktar5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ktar5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5826/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
