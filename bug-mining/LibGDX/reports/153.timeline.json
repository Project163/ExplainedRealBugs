Or, the `toString` could change and I wouldn't expect it to break serialized data, whereas changing the name I would expect it to break. Or, the `toString` could be dynamic, based on some state of the enum (maybe a bit strange, but not impossible).\n\nIs it possible to migrate your data to use the enum name? If you temporarily changed to name to use `equalsIgnoreCase`, then deserialize and serialize your data, it would be serialized with the name and could later be deserialized without `equalsIgnoreCase`.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/58634080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/58636235","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2448#issuecomment-58636235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2448","id":58636235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjM2MjM1","user":{"login":"RotaruDan","id":5658058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTgwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5658058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan","html_url":"https://github.com/RotaruDan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RotaruDan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-10T10:05:10Z","updated_at":"2014-10-10T10:11:11Z","body":"It's possible but we would have to change the `jsonschema2pojo` generator and that's not in my domain, we would also have to go test by test and see where this is used and change it.
