not 100% sure (in a trip right now), but there is a difference between file.exists and FileHandle.exists. First one is ok, second one is slow.\n\nThe second one is slow (if I remember correct, was a long time ago) just because if it fails with file.exists check, it tries to do FileHandle.class.getResource. (line 526 of FileHandle - fall through comment). It is done to assure correct check of directories. However in the comment of these function it is written that \"On Android, a {@link FileType#Classpath} or {@link FileType#Internal} handle to a directory will always return false\". So no reason for such slow check if should anyway return false. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nProbably just remove this last check only for android and internal files?

\nJust to clarify, `AndroidFileHandle.exist()` overrides `FileHandle.exist()`. When the file is not found on the internal filesystem `assets.list(fileName)` is executed to check directories, which makes exists() slow on Android, see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-android/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/android/AndroidFileHandle.java#L194\nAndroidFileHandler.read() is very similar to exists() except for directory scan, which is not needed in this case. This explains why your workaround is faster on Android.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/56282576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davebaol","id":2366334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjYzMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2366334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol","html_url":"https://github.com/davebaol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":168100087,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY4MTAwMDg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/168100087","actor":{"login":"titovmaxim","id":1524918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim","html_url":"https://github.com/titovmaxim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-20T22:37:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
