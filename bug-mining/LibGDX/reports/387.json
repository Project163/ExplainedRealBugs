These two styles must currently be updated manually, via `SelectBox#getScrollPane#setStyle` & `SelectBox#getList#setStyle`, in addition to calling `SelectBox#setStyle`.\n\nThis is unexpected behavior, resulting in a partially styled `SelectBox`, and took me quite a long time to figure out. This should be a very simple fix btw, but am not currently set up to test LibGDX source.\n\nProposed (untested) fix:\n\n```\ndiff --git a/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/SelectBox.java b/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/SelectBox.java\nindex 9c53fc2..8ff1366 100644\n--- a/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/SelectBox.java\n+++ b/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui/SelectBox.java\n@@ -116,6 +116,8 @@ public class SelectBox<T> extends Widget implements Disableable {\n        public void setStyle (SelectBoxStyle style) {\n                if (style == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"style cannot be null.\");\n                this.style = style;\n+    selectBoxList.setStyle (style.scrollStyle);\n+    selectBoxList.list.setStyle (style.listStyle);\n                invalidateHierarchy();\n        }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
