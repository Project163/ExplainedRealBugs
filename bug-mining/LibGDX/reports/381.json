Seems related to https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/3840e4eea50482409972fc78a60e1deb69a59250.\n\nIn addition to adding wrapping, at least VerticalGroup behaviour is different than it was on earlier libGDX versions (with wrap set to false). I use VerticalGroup/HorizontalGroup as a lightweight containers for displaying elements in a column/row that auto-sizes with the inserted elements. Now setSize() seems to be required,  if this is intended behaviour it should probably be added to the CHANGES because it breaks existing UIs that make use of them.\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nSSCCE\nhttp://pastebin.com/JWiHkHwk\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.9.4-SNAPSHOT\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [x] Android\n- [x] iOS (robovm)\n- [x] iOS (MOE)\n- [x] HTML/GWT\n- [x] Windows\n- [x] Linux\n- [x] MacOS\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4243/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
