I would like to use LibGDX's markup language to use in an ingame chat but the issue with this is that if a user uses a color code incorrectly, all the clients will crash. I thought it might be a good idea to instead of crashing the program when it encounters an invalid color code it could instead just remove the color code and print the error in the console.
