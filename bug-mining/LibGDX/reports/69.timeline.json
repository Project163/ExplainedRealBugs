For fast result.\n\nShort answer there is only one point in vector2 to ensure collinearity if already normalised and it is that vector A and B are equals +/- error\n\nAnd colinearOpposite is true if A = -B \n\nSince both A and B must pass by zero,zero and a point. So normalised numbers must be equals.\n\nSo v1 and v2 equals to (1,2) returns false even in my test that is normalised.\n\nRegards,\n\nBernard Guillot\n+852 9150 1550\n\n> On 9 Apr, 2014, at 8:43 pm,
