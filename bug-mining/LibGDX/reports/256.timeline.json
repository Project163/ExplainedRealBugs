Looks like a good addition, would you mind to [send a pull request](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Contributing) for it?\n\nIf there's an intersection and the intersection point is requested then that point should be within the bounds of the bounding box. Clamping the value to avoid small floating point errors sounds like a good way to guarantee that.\n\nIf the origin is inside the box then indeed the intersection point should be set as well. Setting it to the origin looks like the most obvious and simple solution for that. In that case the intersection point would be defined as \"the point on the ray closest to the origin which is within the specified bounds\".\n\nSomeone might expect the intersection point to be both _on_ the ray and _on_ the bounding box (each of the six planes) though. Floating point errors are to be expected, but having an intersection point _inside_ the bounding box might not be that obvious. So adding a line to the javadocs might be a good idea.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/101364201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/101566528","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3120#issuecomment-101566528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3120","id":101566528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTU2NjUyOA==","user":{"login":"fwolff","id":527445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzQ0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff","html_url":"https://github.com/fwolff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fwolff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-13T08:16:36Z","updated_at":"2015-05-13T08:16:36Z","body":"Pull request sent.\n\nI have added a comment about what is returned by this method, in particular in the case of a ray origin inside the box.\n\nRegarding this part of your comment: \n\n> Someone might expect the intersection point to be both _on_ the ray and _on_ the bounding box (each of the six planes) though.\n\nI think this is not the only issue with my fix: the way I'm clamping the intersection point can make it slightly diverge from the ray.
