Have you come across any issue due to this or can tell us more about the risks you see or you just found out when enabling Strict mode?\r\n\r\n@MrStahlfelge Independently from this issue, I think that

reaction to #6345, this makes the instantiation of Files implementation overridable on Android. GWT is done, too, because overriding it is useful in projects often to change the handling of local files. Discussing with @obigu, we never had the need to change Files on desktop or iOS, so this is not changed here.\r\n\r\nTesting discovered that `FilesTest` was broken on non-GWT platforms by #6188 and is fixed hereby.\r\n\r\nEntry suggestion for CHANGES file:\r\n```\r\n* API Change: AndroidFiles and GwtFiles instantiation can be overriden by own classes. NoExternalAndroidFiles implementation can be used to avoid unnecessary write to external files dir if not needed (see #6345)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/757543296","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6345#issuecomment-757543296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6345","id":757543296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NzU0MzI5Ng==","user":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-10T21:00:16Z","updated_at":"2021-01-10T21:00:16Z","body":"@cthomis Please check the linked PR.
