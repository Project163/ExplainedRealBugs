This only seems to happen when the text in my text field is => 17 characters long. \nI've tried 3 other fonts and the problem persists, although it goes away if I use the default font shipped with LibGDX. Perhaps it's a FreeTypeFont issue? Looking at the stack trace, maybe it incorrectly determines offsets?\n\nMy version of LibGDX is 1.9.4 with FreeTypeFont extension.
