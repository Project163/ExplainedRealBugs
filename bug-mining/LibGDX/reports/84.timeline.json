translation:\n\nproblem: gradle is slow in China\n\ntwo ways to fix:\n1. use local gradle\n2. fix download address\n\nLocal Gradle\nthis method doesn't use the wrapper, it uses diffrent methods to install gradle and run it directly.  keep in mind when you use it you don't use the gradlew command (use gradle)\n\nthis way is easy, but you don't get the convenience of the wrapper\n\nFix Download Address\n\nAll you have to do is change the distributionUrl property in build.gradle:\n\ntask prepareWrapper(type: Wrapper) {\n   gradleVersion = '1.12'\n   distributionUrl = 'alternative.location'\n}\n\nor you can create a gradle-wrapper.properties file:\n\ndistributionUrl=http://some.location.net/gradle-distributions/gradle-1.12-bin.zip\n\nYou can use any address you choose, such as your own server.\n\nGradle will resolve dependencies on its own using mavneCentral(), the speed is not great, using a mirror is better\n\nOschina has a mirror: http://maven.oschina.net/content/groups/public/\n\nreplace \"mavenCentral()\" with:\n\nmaven {\n  url 'http://maven.oschina.net/content/groups/public/'\n}\n\nthen you can use 'gradlew tasks' to test

Your blog post specifies a good Maven mirror URL, but no gradle wrapper url. We plan on adding that checkbox i mentioned so things get automatically setup for chinese users. We just need a URL for the gradle wrapper.\n\nThanks!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/42739304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":119798448,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE5Nzk4NDQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/119798448","actor":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-05-10T11:26:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":119798449,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExOTc5ODQ0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/119798449","actor":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-05-10T11:26:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/42740022","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1792#issuecomment-42740022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1792","id":42740022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzQwMDIy","user":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-10T12:06:05Z","updated_at":"2014-05-10T12:06:05Z","body":"Actually,I

a custom wrapper and custom proxy settings seems like something that each user should do on their own as they will be different for every user and we don't want to bloat the setup with lots of fields.\n\nThe time that is potentially saved is negligible, and any user that knows they need a proxy/alternate wrapper would and could easily look this up from the Gradle docs and implement it themselves.\n\nAdding a field for an alternate maven mirror is what makes most sense to me as a generic solution for this issue.
