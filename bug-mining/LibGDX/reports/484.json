I create a new project with only Desktop selected and I generate it. The generation is successful, so I continue by opening the project in IntelliJ IDEA 2019.1.3 Community Edition (Windows 10 Home 64 bit). Even though the default red background with the libGDX logo application runs fine, I just can't deploy it with Gradle to Desktop. I am using JDK 1.8.0_211 but the same happens with JDK 12.0.1\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nCreate a new project with the Libgdx Project Generator only for Desktop and with no extensions, open it in IntelliJ IDEA, go to Terminal tab at the bottom and type gradlew desktop:dist.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.10 with no extensions as per Libgdx Project Generator\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\n```java\r\n> Task :core:compileJava FAILED\r\nerror: Source option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.\r\nerror: Target option 6 is no longer supported.

But I still get an error:\r\n```java\r\n> Task :desktop:dist FAILED\r\n\r\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nExecution failed for task ':desktop:dist'.\r\n> Failed to create MD5 hash for file '...\\Deploy\\core\\build\\libs\\core-1.0.jar' as it does not exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [ ] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5716/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
