After looking at the source it looks like getLocalAxisA is calling a native function jniGetLocalAnchorA instead of jniGetLocalAxisA. Relevant function is on line 66 in WheelJoint.java:\n\n[link to WheelJoint.java](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/extensions/gdx-box2d/gdx-box2d/src/com/badlogic/gdx/physics/box2d/joints/WheelJoint.java)\n\n```\npublic Vector2 getLocalAxisA(){\n    jniGetLocalAnchorA(addr, tmp);    //<< Shouldn't this be jniGetLocalAxisA(addr,tmp) ?\n    localAxisA.set(tmp[0], tmp[1]);\n    return localAxisA;\n}\n```\n\nHeres a code snippet to show what I'm talking about: \n\n```\nWorld world = App.engine.systems.physics.world;\nBodyDef bd = new BodyDef();\nbd.type = BodyType.DynamicBody;\n\nBody body = world.createBody(bd),\n     wheel = world.createBody(bd);\n\nPolygonShape rect = new PolygonShape();\nrect.setAsBox(2, 1);\nCircleShape circle = new CircleShape();\ncircle.setRadius(1);\n\nbody.createFixture(rect,1);\nwheel.createFixture(circle,1);\n\nVector2 localAnchor = new Vector2(0,0),\n        localAxis = new Vector2(0,1);\n\nWheelJointDef jd = new WheelJointDef();\njd.initialize(body, wheel, localAnchor , localAxis);\nWheelJoint joint = (WheelJoint)world.createJoint(jd);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Local Axis = \" + joint.getLocalAxisA());\nSystem.out.println(\"Local Anchor A = \" + joint.getLocalAnchorA());\n\n//output: \n//Local Axis = [0.0:0.0]         <<< This should be outputting [0.0:1.0]\n//Local Anchor A = [0.0:0.0]\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
