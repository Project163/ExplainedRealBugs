It sometimes happens that the drawable is rendered at places that exceed the size of the rect where it should actually be drawn. This is due to float precision and the way the number of times the drawable needs to be rendered is calculated.\n\nIn TiledDrawable.java ln44 there's while(x < endX). In my case x is 491.80124 while endX is 491.80127. Consequently the drawable is rendered again exceeding the actual size. Since this depends on the size of the drawable and the rect it should be rendered in I can't provide a simple test. The problem is evident though, the solution prolly simple:\nInstead of subtracting the size of the drawable every time calculate the number of drawables that fit into the rect ONCE. Render the drawables. calculate remaining area/width/height by subtracting widthRect - numRenderedHorizontal*regionWidth and fill the rest with a cropped version of the drawable.\n\nScreenshot: The problem is in the bottom right corner. The panel's border is extended to the right of the screen.\n![2015-04-09 10_37_25-canyonwave](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4849383/7063141/75c1b86a-dea4-11e4-8143-6e9fbe316408.png)\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
