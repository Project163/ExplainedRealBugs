Well, that was a decision made a long time ago. I wish I could remember why. :p If touchDown is handled, touchDragged/touchUp will always fire, so I guess the thought was that by handling touchDown its expected that you will always handle touchDragged and touchUp. That isn't necessarily true, as is the case for ClickListener where touchUp should really only be handled if the click occurred.\n\nFixing this now would mean adding return values to touchUp and touchDragged, which breaks just about every scene2d app. Unfortunately it looks like that is the right thing to do.

Here's what I was writing:\n\n---\n\nscene2d events have the notion of being \"handled\", which means scene2d took care of the event and it should not be propagated to the next InputProcessor. For example, this is what keeps a click on your scene2d UI from going through the UI to the game underneath. Turns out there is an issue. \n\nscene2d requires a touchDown to be handled if you want to receive touchDragged/Up events. It assumes that by handling touchDown you also handle touchDragged/Up. This is not always true, eg you might have a ClickListener on the Stage's root group. touchDown occurs, ClickListener handles it to receive touchDragged/Up. When touchUp occurs, if a click happens it makes sense for the touchUp to be handled. However, if the touch was dragged too far from the touchDown position, then touchUp occurs and a click doesn't happen. In this case maybe you don't want the touchUp to be handled -- tough luck, touchUp is always handled. \n\nThis situation seems rare and means the InputProcessor after the Stage will see a touchDragged/Up without first seeing a touchDown. This is ok, since InputProcessor doesn't have the same guarantees about touchDown/Dragged/Up events that scene2d has, but is still a little odd.\n\n---\n\nI'm thinking about reverting the change since I think it is quite rare to need to handle touchDown but not touchDragged/Up. Any thoughts?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/37926006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":102979406,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxMDI5Nzk0MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/102979406","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-03-18T12:17:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":102995814,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwMjk5NTgxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/102995814","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d37b2de8a27ccedbee92a80cb601783a745fe2a4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/d37b2de8a27ccedbee92a80cb601783a745fe2a4","created_at":"2014-03-18T13:14:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/37930843","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1481#issuecomment-37930843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1481","id":37930843,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTMwODQz","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/pr

so it doesn't break people in the meantime. Can make the changes if we decide, but I'm thinking it's odd to handle touchDown (which scene2d requires for receiving touchDragged/Up) and not handle touchDragged/Up. The next InputProcessor would not see a touchDown but would see touchDragged/Up. In the rare case you do need to handle touchDown and not touchDragged/Up it could be done other ways (extend Stage to return false).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/37930843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/37935214","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1481#issuecomment-37935214","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1481","id":37935214,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTM1MjE0","user":{"login":"Phibedy","id":1841954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDE5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1841954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy","html_url":"https://github.com/Phibedy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phibedy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-18T13:59:57Z","updated_at":"2014-03-18T13:59:57Z","body":"I
