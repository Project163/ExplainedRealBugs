Im not sure if this is a bug or wanted behaviour, maybe its got something to do with the changes to GlyphLayout.\n\nTake this code:\n\n```\nGlyphLayout layout = new GlyphLayout();\nFreeTypeFontGenerator generator = new FreeTypeFontGenerator(Gdx.files.internal(\"data/arial.ttf\"));\n// init font properties skipped\nBitmapFont someBitmapFont = generator.generateFont(parameter);\n\nlayout.setText(someBitmapFont, \"Line1\\n\\nLine2\", Color.WHITE, screenW, Align.center, true);\nsomeBitmapFont.draw(spriteBatch, layout, 0, screenH / 2 + layout.height / 2);\n```\n\nIn 1.5.6 the string \"Line1\\n\\nLine2\" gets displayed like this:\n\n```\nLine1\n\nLine2\n```\n\nin 1.6.0 the aditional newline is missing, it looks like this on the screen:\n\n```\nLine1\nLine2\n```\n\nNot sure about the reason, maybe the empty line has a height of 0 or something like that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
