This is the part of the code I am referring to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\tDisplayMode bestMode = null;\r\n\t\t\t\tfor(DisplayMode mode: getDisplayModes()) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif(mode.width == config.width && mode.height == config.height) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif(bestMode == null || bestMode.refreshRate < this.getDisplayMode().refreshRate) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbestMode = mode;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\tif(bestMode == null) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbestMode = this.getDisplayMode();\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\tdisplayCreated = setFullscreenMode(bestMode);\r\n```\r\nAs you can see in this loop, it updates 'bestMode' based on refresh rate. The problem is, display modes (with their respective refresh rates) are returned completely random. This is an example of the list from my system:\r\n```\r\n[<09:40:54.928>] *** mode: 1366x768, bpp: 32, hz: 119\r\n[<09:40:54.928>] *** mode: 1600x1024, bpp: 32, hz: 100\r\n[<09:40:54.928>] *** mode:

specified resolution, where refresh rate would be as high as possible. However, the current code simply selects one at random, which is a mistake in the condition in this line:\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif(bestMode == null || bestMode.refreshRate < this.getDisplayMode().refreshRate) {\r\n```\r\nI believe that intended condition is this:\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif(bestMode == null || bestMode.refreshRate < mode.refreshRate) {\r\n```\r\nwhich would make sense. So I propose this line to be changed to the above.\r\n\r\nLibGDX version: current one (1.11.0)\r\nPlatform: Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS)","closed_by":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
