While I doubt those are intensive enough to max out the cpu, benchmarking probably should be done to those actions to make sure they're not eating up more CPU than they really need, just to be sure as I don't think anyone has actually done that before.\n\nThat said, I am unsure about the level of support for the JGLFW backend.  It always appeared to be more of an experimental backend compared to how much support and usage the LWJGL one gets.  Plus it may just become obsolete when LWJGL 3 come around and backend support is added for that, as LWJGL3 uses
