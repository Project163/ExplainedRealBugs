For instance I had to add icons to the SelectBox's UI. To do this I had to copy and paste the entire code of SelectBox (rewrite a new version of it), because the `drawItem` function of SelectBoxList cannot be overwritten. The amount of copy-pasted code would be highly reduced if SelectBoxList was public\r\n- Detect if an actor is a SelectBoxList. Currently the best way to check if it's one is to compare the String class name which is unefficient and ugly. Checking if the clicked actor is a SelectBoxList is very useful when detecting clicks outside an actor and it's children, as the SelectBoxList itself is not a children of SelectBox, creating a need to handle its click events separately.\r\n\r\nA possible solution for both issues would be to make the inner class SelectBoxList public. A solution for the first point only would be to delegate the `drawItem` function entirely to the SelectBox, allowing to change the way items are drawn by overriding the SelectBox.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/880982448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WinterAlexander","id":8527540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1Mjc1NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8527540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander","html_url":"https://github.com/WinterAlexander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5037258159,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwMzcyNTgxNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/5037258159","actor":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-19T09:19:57Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5037258165,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwMzcyNTgxNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/5037258165","actor":{"login":"MrStahlfelge","id":26038055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM4MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26038055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge","html_url":"https://github.com/MrStahlfelge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrStahlfelge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-19T09:19:57Z","label":{"name":"scene2d","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/882849903","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6598#issuecomment-882849903","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6598","id":882849903,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFH-b840nzhv","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nath

has a SelectBoxList which has a List. Making SelectBoxList public doesn't help to override List `drawItem`.\r\n\r\nNote SelectBoxList is actually a ScrollPane. Good thing it's private so we can rename it. ;) Though I'm not sure what a good name would be: SelectBoxScrollPane, SelectBoxScroll, ListScrollPane, ListScroll, none of these are great. `SelectBoxScroll` I guess. If it's private the name doesn't matter, but calling it a list adds to the confusion.\r\n\r\nThe List is exposed via SelectBox `getList` but the SelectBoxList is not. I'm not sure exposing SelectBoxList would help in any situation. We could have SelectBox `getScrollPane` which returns ScrollPane. Currently you can do that with the ugly `(ScrollPane)select.getList().getParent()`.\r\n\r\nAs for a select box with icons left of each item, I've also needed that (plus text on the right) and I copy/pasted SelectBox. Eg:\r\n![](http://n4te.com/x/2163-pLz7.png)\r\n\r\nAnother time I needed to customize the list differently, so again copy/paste SelectBox:\r\n![](http://n4te.com/x/2164-Ep2u.png)\r\n\r\nOnce I needed a SelectBox with different fonts for some items, guess what? Copy/paste:\r\n![](http://n4te.com/x/2165-JTtV.png)\r\n\r\nDelegating List `drawItem` to SelectBox could help, as it already does `toString(item)`. It's not a great pattern though and can lead to a monstrosity, like the way LwjglFrame has many methods for its LwjglCanvas.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would handle some use cases to have a protected SelectBox `newList`, allowing a subclass to swap out the list.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/882849903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/883772975","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6598#issuecomment-883772975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6598","id":883772975,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAFH-b840rU4v","user":{"login":"WinterAlexander","id":8527540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1Mjc1NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8527540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander","html_url":"https://github.com/WinterAlexander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WinterAlexander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-20T23:34:22Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T23:36:24Z","body":"> Delegating List drawItem to SelectBox could help, as it already does toString(item).

This would allow all form of rendering.\r\n\r\n In terms of pattern though, I would tend to prefer simple protected methods inside SelectBox instead. This option is quite clean for an outside user of SelectBox, the fact the protected methods are being used by an inner class doesn't appear or manifests in any sort of way when using the class.

In my opinion the inconsistent way in which items are draw (two different drawItem functions, one in SelectBox and one in List) is much worse.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't call it inconsistent. One is drawing the item in the select box, the other is drawing items in the list. The select box and the list are not the same.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs any time you build a UI control (Widget in scene2d.ui, as much as I dislike that word, couldn't find a better one) using multiple components.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's a great design to pull the details of all those components into the UI control. It bloats the API. It limits customization to only what is exposed. That leads to exposing more, which bloats the API more. Better to keep the components doing what they do separately and also customize them separately.\r\n\r\nWe can expose creation of the components so they can be customized. It makes customization a bit verbose, but otherwise it's pretty OK.\r\n\r\nKnowing if an actor is a descendant of a select box scroll pane (not a descendant of the select box itself) is a separate problem. We can expose the class in SelectBox since we'll need to do so to allow customization of the scroll pane.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/890386924/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5094617362,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTA5NDYxNzM2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/5094617362","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0da57d3087b75f9034c0bd89f4453e6a49ce06f6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/0da57d3087b75f9034c0bd89f4453e6a49ce06f6","created_at":"2021-07-31T18:39:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5125034076,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxMjUwMzQwNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/5125034076","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c460205e1f05a594be09751f6db17f96d9aa0737","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tommyettinger/libgdx/commits/c460205e1f05a594be09751f6db17f96d9aa0737","created_at":"2021-08-06T22:42:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12241266442,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAFH-b844XkCKzwAAAALZoucK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/12241266442","actor":{"login":"tommyettinger","id":160684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger","html_url":"https://github.com/tommyettinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tommyettinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.
