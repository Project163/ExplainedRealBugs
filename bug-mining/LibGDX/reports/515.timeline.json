Nothing is \"randomly being committed to master\" and there will always be  issues that PR reviews and testing just can't prevent, see for example the recent problems due to differences between Travis CI (used to check whether the PRs compile) and Jenkins (used to actually build the snapshots). \r\n\r\nAlso, snapshots are not there to replace official and stable releases. Relying on them is and always will be at your own risk! We recognize that due to the large time between releases, in the past, users may have been inclined to use these snapshots more often, but we are working on shorter release cycles exactly to remedy such problems.

the vague report, I'm trying to debug on my own and figure it out to no avail.\r\n\r\nSituation: My app was updated the other day, I had to update some Gradle dependencies, recompile, and upload to Google Play. (So the LibGDX Snapshot probably updated.) Nothing else was changed. The next day I received reports from only a couple users showing me what is in the below screenshots. Some buttons in my app's menu are the wrong size, huge and broken in some cases.\r\n\r\nI installed on all of my 7 test devices, no issue. I cannot reproduce this.\r\nSeemingly nobody else is reporting this issue either.\r\n**I thought it a fluke, but today a couple more reported to me as well.**\r\n\r\nEven odder, a reinstall of the app fixes it, as these users have told me. The way the UI is built is absolutely not dependent with any persistent/saved properties where a reinstall would fix it. This is very bizarre.\r\n\r\nScreenshots (notice the left-side, the top buttons are either \"too big\" or \"take up the whole screen big\", also you'll notice another button is seemingly shifted out of the menu horizontally as well).\r\n\r\n- https://i.imgur.com/oMYwhC7.jpg \r\n- https://i.imgur.com/BNAGEBS.jpg\r\n\r\nI notice a common factor in the code where these buttons are added to the ScrollPane's Table:\r\n```\r\n_undoButton = createToolTextButton(App.bundle.format(\"undo\"), Module.getNormalButtonStyle());\r\nadd(_undoButton).align(Align.right).height(_undoButton.getHeight() * 0.75f);\r\n\r\npublic static TextButton createToolTextButton(String text, TextButtonStyle textButtonStyle)\r\n{\r\n\tTextButton textButton = new TextButton(text, textButtonStyle);\r\n\ttextButton.getLabel().setWrap(true);\r\n\ttextButton.getCell(textButton.getLabel()).pad(0, 4, 0, 4);\r\n\r\n\treturn textButton;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI modify the height by taking the height of the Button and scaling it down 0.75f. This code has been in place for years but likely something is either wrong or this is now deprecated behavior?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the button which is shifted out of view horitontally has width-edit code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_importStickfigureButton = createToolImageTextButton2(App.bundle.format(\"importStickfigure\"), Module.getLargeStickfigureButtonStyle());\r\nimportTable.add(_importStickfigureButton).width(_importStickfigureButton.getWidth() * 0.75f);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the Table object these buttons are added to is initialize like:\r\n```\r\n\r\npublic void initialize(Drawable tableGrayBackground)\r\n{\r\n\t// Setup the table.\r\n\tif (tableGrayBackground != null)\r\n\t\tsetBackground(tableGrayBackground);\r\n\tpad(20, 0, 20, 0);\r\n\tdefaults().space(0).spaceRight(10).spaceBottom(10).pad(0).align(Align.center).expandX().uniformX();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI notice commits were made recently to scene2d recently (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commits/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/scenes/scene2d/ui), specifically about layout() stuff (41e65e25cfd24ec72aaf01fbf1aa39e1001019b2).\r\n\r\nI'd have to believe something is wrong in one of these recent commits. I apologize again for the vague issue report where I can't pinpoint the exact problem, but hoping maybe the source of this problem is more apparent to one of you guys?\r\n\r\nI'm still confused as to why this affects a very small percentage of users, and a reinstall fixes it.\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.12-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ X] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [ ] Linux\r\n- [ ] MacOS\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13700427317,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAFH-b84pPEkrzwAAAAMwm-41","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/13700427317","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a077dccc987ab6ee90c092912ebf37f9a7da8aec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tom-Ski/libgdx/commits/a077dccc987ab6ee90c092912ebf37f9a7da8aec","created_at":"2024-07-30T19:26:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
