But we could overwrite that back to current behaviour in Widget and WidgetGroup, so it would stay the same for scene2d UI (where the pixel-perfect assumption will be usually correct).\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/87461247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Darkyenus","id":5280068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODAwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5280068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus","html_url":"https://github.com/Darkyenus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Darkyenus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":268047854,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY4MDQ3ODU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/268047854","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ba7449a27fd91da3dc06d67bb1e45b36c31b56c3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/ba7449a27fd91da3dc06d67bb1e45b36c31b56c3","created_at":"2015-03-29T23:27:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
