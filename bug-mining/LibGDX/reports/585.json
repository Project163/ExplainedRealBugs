It seems that the delta time doesnt change when it should be affected by the window being resized. I used the method to make my own delta time for testing and that one was different to what the methods delta was giving me and it fixed the speeding up issue if I used my own one instead.\r\nI have only tested this on linux\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nCreate a screen that uses an ExtendViewport (just what I use, should make it easier to see) and make a sprite move around the screen, make sure it uses delta to keep it tied to the frame rate. As you are resizing the screen it will speed up the movement of the sprite.\r\n\r\n#### Version of libGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\nI tested it on gdx 1.10.0. 1.11.0 and 1.12.0 and it happens on them all\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [ ] Android\r\n- [ ] iOS\r\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\r\n- [ ] Windows\r\n- [x] Linux\r\n- [ ] macOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"crykn","id":8125827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjU4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8125827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn","html_url":"https://github.com/crykn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crykn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/7253/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/7253/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
