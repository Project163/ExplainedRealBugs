The change is very painful as a lot of libraries like (VisUI and TypingLabel depend on Label and the commit breaks that).\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps/code\r\nUsing Libgdx version 1.9.11-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\r\n1.9.11-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\n#### Stacktrace\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Please select the affected platforms\r\n- [x ] Android\r\n- [x ] iOS (robovm)\r\n- [x ] iOS (MOE)\r\n- [ x] HTML/GWT\r\n- [x ] Windows\r\n- [x ] Linux\r\n- [x ] MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6063/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
