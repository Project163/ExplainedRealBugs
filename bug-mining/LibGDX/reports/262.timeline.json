am working with the Timer utility on an android application. LibGdx version is 0.9.9 (latest stable).\nThe issue is caused (again) by android's weird policy with keeping static objects over app restarts.\nThe following is a description what causes the problem to occur:\n- The app launches for the first time \n- `Timer` is creating its `TimerThread`\n- The thread registers itself as a `LifecycleListener`\n- The app is left (works best for me when I turn off the screen and wait for the device to be pattern-locked)\n- When the app is entered again, `onCreate` is called, leading to a new `initialize()ation`=> `Gdx.app` is new, with a new list of LifecycleListeners\n- `Timer.thread` is not null, for it \"statically survived\" => It is not being created in `Timer.instance.start` (the method itself probably isn't even called, because `instance` survived, too)\n- The timer's LifecycleListener methods are not invoked either, because the listener is not registered any more  \n\n=> The thread remains dead\n\nFor fixing the problem, I suggest setting `Timer.thread` to null in `Timer.TimerThread.pause`. If you are concerned about increased unnecessary `TimerThread` instantiations, one might as well keep a reference to the actual `Thread` which is created in `TimerThread.resume`, allowing to poll the thread's state in `Timer.instance`\n\n**Additional information:**\nStrangely, I was not able to reproduce this issue when being connected to the pc (i.e. a power source). So I suggest using adb over network when debugging \nThe problem occurred with all of our team members, which is 6 persons with at least 3 different device types.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":319622718,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzE5NjIyNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/319622718","actor":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"bcc1e9e3770665d886b13a3e8359c78507a81c9c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/bcc1e9e3770665d886b13a3e8359c78507a81c9c","created_at":"2015-06-02T04:55:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
