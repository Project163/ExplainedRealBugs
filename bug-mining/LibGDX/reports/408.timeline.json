sense, I see what I can do.\n\nOn Mar 17, 2017 12:11 PM, \"Thomas Neidhart\" <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Issue details\n>\n> I have noticed that the native library libgdx.so might be loaded twice on\n> Android:\n>\n>    - first time using GdxNativesLoader (used in AndroidApplication)\n>    - second time in AndroidGL20 via System.loadLibrary\n>\n> This might be an artefact of the time when the AndroidGL20 class had its\n> own native library.\n> From my understanding it should not be needed anymore to call\n> System.loadLibrary explicitly in the AndroidGL20 class.\n>\n> In general this should not make problems, but when using some obfuscators\n> (e.g. DexGuard) it would be easier if the native library is only loaded via\n> one mechanism, i.e. GdxNativesLoader -> SharedLibraryLoader.\n> Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n>\n> in master (currently 1.9.7-SNAPSHOT?)\n> Please select the affected platforms\n>\n>    - Android\n>\n> —\n> You are
