ended up with this fast and straightforward solution:\n\n``` java\npublic static boolean intersectRayTriangle (Ray ray, Vector3 t1, Vector3 t2, Vector3 t3, Vector3 intersection) {\n    if (t1.idt(ray.origin) || t2.idt(ray.origin) || t3.idt(ray.origin)) {\n        if (intersection != null) intersection.set(ray.origin);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    p.set(t1, t2, t3);\n    if (!intersectRayPlane(ray, p, i)) return false;\n    ...\n```\n\nIt doesn't address all possible issues but it guarantees, at least, that the method won't return false when it should obviously return true...\n\nSee my full pull request
