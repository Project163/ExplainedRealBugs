To reproduce the case, the easiest way is to reproduce the table given in post #1 because of its specific layout (many images in the first row, a label in the last row, with a column spanned across all above columns and giving its width to the table, ...). But it's not the sole condition. On some devices, this layout could display no issue because the table is proportionally sized so, depending on the density and screen size, different computations implying float values are done and would lead to different results. Thanks to this unaccuracy (the result that should be equal is almost never equal), the code enters a branch where everything is computed more or less properly so the bug is difficult to see. If you enter the right branch of code which skips useless computations you should see it clearly. That's why providing an example is not enough to debug (and I'm sorry to not provide such an example but I already spent two hours to find and fix this bug and I didn't want to spend more time on it; the library that I use is a wrapper around the java files of libGDX so I just have a copy of these files on my disk; I have no ready-to-use version  of the original library and I have not set up my Eclipse IDE for the development of Android apps; in brief: I'm not a Java user of libGDX and I don't write Java apps; but don't be fooled: as I wrote a wrapper, I read the libGDX code from the first line to the last one and I have a very good knowledge of this lib and of Java in general).\nYou can see the issue with other tables if they have a similar layout. Images have no min width by default, while labels have one, and it's an important difference to reveal the bug; change one of the image in the first row by a label and you might see no issue. I drew the debug lines in the first post to help to understand how the table is made.\nNote that I noticed this bug in a table different from the one in post #1. So I'm sure that the above table is not the only case (it's just the table that I used to test).\nFor me, the bug lies here:\ncolumnWeightedWidth = columnMinWidth;\nI suggested to replace minWidth by PrefWidth so the columns are properly sized. But there's maybe a better fix (since I started writing the wrapper, I fixed dozens of bugs before they are reported here, but in the end all of them except two were eventually fixed and, in a few cases, with a better fix than mine, that's why I'm always interested to know what other people did or would do and keep an eye on all changes made to the library).\n\nI know this a long and boring post, but by rewriting all of the above posts, I hope it's more clear. That does not change the fact that I won't contribute any more. I did not appreciate the comments in this case and others.\n\nAbout the case of GestureDetector, I reported a bug and provided a fix as you noticed but no one tried to reproduce the case or evaluate my suggestion. And as others, you did not pay attention to the fact that this bug existed since a long time. So reverting to a former version of GD did not change anything. In one of my messages of the thread, I posted a whole class instead of just a few lines because of the context. My suggestion was done just after big changes were made to the GD class and these changes were mostly untested and did not work very well, so I wanted to contribute to the class rewriting. My code was not fully tested because I cannot test every case (I don't think to every possible use of the GestureDetector class) BUT I try every bit of code I submit. I'm just used in my job to let other people test a fix with different cases (where I work, bugs are not tolerated, even the slightest ones so there are teams whose the work is just to test bug fixes). Did someone try my work? I don't think so. It's not really a problem because it had a small flaw as I saw later with a new test and should have been improved. But the bug fixed in the first place with fling existed in the lib before changes were made, is still there and the fix is always valid (although I don't really understand what's the usefulness of such a setting; is there someone using
