I agree about Group transform scale 0. It is another situation. Imagine that a lot of buttons are drawn. The buttons \"flies\" (scales) from 0 to 1 when they appear and then back, when dissaper (not the group, but separate buttons). Some buttons have text label on the top and the from texture is different from the button texture. CPU sprite batch draw the button with scale 0, than it should draw the label. But it need to change texture. Therefore if flushes and 0 scale matrix become the real transform matrix. After that CpuSpriteBatch can not draw anything and the exception is thrown. That was my case.\n\nWhich is a better solution in your opinion? Either we can make it \"pure\" cpu, or make some estimations of matrix and copy it to real transform matrix only in the case it is \"far\" form singular (have scale more than some threshold, so it can be inverted without exception and significant lose of precision).
