Calls to Music.getPosition() on the desktop backend return values that increase too quickly (maybe this depends on the hardware implementation?). You can test this by playing music and keeping elapsed time in the application's render method with Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTIme(). If you compare the elapsed time to what getPosition() returns you will see that getPosition() increases at a faster rate that the elapsed time. You can modify the MusicTest file in gdx-tests to set this up quickly but note that this does not happen with all songs, here is one that it does happen with (for me at least): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx9k9I8v-JzvV19Gd0xBUk02TWs/edit?usp=sharing.\n\nI have no clue about openal but doing a quick google search many people say that AL11.AL_SEC_OFFSET rounds and that perhaps AL_SAMPLE_OFFSET divided by the sample rate will be a more accurate value? I also notice that the desktop backend keeps track of renderedSeconds which gets added to AL_SEC_OFFSET??)\n","closed_by":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1952/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
