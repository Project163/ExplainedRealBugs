This label will be in a new line but after libgdx version 1.7.0 this label will be in the right side of the previous label. \n\nThis image was taken using 1.6.5.\n![screen shot 2016-07-08 at 9 23 58 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3458265/16688803/65eb05a2-4552-11e6-817e-88551bcb01b1.png)\n\nAnd this one using the latest release 1.9.3.\n![screen shot 2016-07-08 at 9 26 00 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3458265/16688849/a0b49ba8-4552-11e6-8c96-84d17979ba50.png)\n#### Reproduction steps/code\n\nI created a simple code.
