If no such bit exists then -1 is returned.\n\nThere is no such case; a clear bit always exist. To demonstrate this error, I wrote the following test case, which fails with `java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<64> but was:<-1>`.\n\n``` java\nBits bits = new Bits();\nfor (int i = 0; i < 64; ++i) { // Edit: changed from 65 to 64.\n    bits.set(i);\n    assertEquals(i + 1, bits.nextClearBit(0));\n}\n```\n\nTo fix this issue, `return -1;` can be replaced with `return bits.length << 6;`. This nasty bug occurs in two places in the `Bits.nextClearBit(int)` function.\n","closed_by":{"login":"xoppa","id":2349087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDkwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2349087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa","html_url":"https://github.com/xoppa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xoppa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
