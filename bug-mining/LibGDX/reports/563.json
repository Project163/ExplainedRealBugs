So when you handle device rotations (e.g. within the `ApplicationAdapter`'s resize method), you cannot know exactly what situation the device is in. BTW, on Android `getNativeOrientation()` always report the correct value (i.e. the same value independently from the current device rotation).\r\n\r\nI would suggest a tricky code, in order to precalculate (on iOS) the native orientation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint screenWidth = Gdx.graphics.getBackBufferWidth();\r\nint screenHeight = Gdx.graphics.getBackBufferHeight();\r\nint deviceRotation = Gdx.input.getRotation();\r\n\r\nif (((deviceRotation == 0  deviceRotation == 180) && (screenWidth >= screenHeight)) \r\n    ((deviceRotation == 90 || deviceRotation == 270) && (screenWidth <= screenHeight))) {\r\n    _nativeDeviceOrientation = Input.Orientation.Landscape;\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    _nativeDeviceOrientation = Input.Orientation.Portrait;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeedback would be appreciated.
