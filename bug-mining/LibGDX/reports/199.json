Throws an IllegalArgumentException in case it is not called in between a\n     * {@link #begin()}/{@link #end()} block.\n     * \n     * @param name the name of the uniform\n     * @param values x and y as the first and second values respectively */\n    public void setUniformf (String name, Vector2 values) {\n        setUniformf(name, values.x, values.y);\n    }\n\n```\n\nBut if I try to execute the following code:\n\n``` java\n@Override\n    public void render() {\n        Gdx.gl.glClearColor(0.8f, 0.8f, 0.8f, 1.0f);\n        Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n\n        viewport.update(Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight());\n        batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);\n\n        fontShader.setUniformf(\"u_glow\", GLOW);\n        fontShader.setUniformf(\"u_outline\", OUTLINE);\n\n        batch.begin();\n\n\n\n        fontShader.setUniformf(\"u_glowColor\", GLOW_COLOR);\n        fontShader.setUniformf(\"u_outlineColor\", OUTLINE_COLOR);\n\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableGlow\", 0);\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableOutline\", 0);\n        font.draw(batch, \" No effects\", 20.0f, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 50.0f);\n        batch.flush();\n\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableGlow\", 0);\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableOutline\", 1);\n        font.draw(batch, \"Just outline\", 20.0f, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 200.0f);\n        batch.flush();\n\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableGlow\", 1);\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableOutline\", 0);\n        font.draw(batch, \"Just glow\", 20.0f, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 350.0f);\n        batch.flush();\n\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableGlow\", 1);\n        fontShader.setUniformi(\"u_enableOutline\", 1);\n        font.draw(batch, \"Outline and glow\", 20.0f, VIRTUAL_HEIGHT - 500.0f);\n        batch.flush();\n\n        batch.end();\n    }\n\n```\n\nno exception is thrown!! I have spent a lot of time looking at that trying to understand why the shader didn't works. \n\nI think it's a bug, let me know your view.\n\nThanks!\nDaniele. \n","closed_by":{"login":"badlogic","id":514052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic","html_url":"https://github.com/badlogic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badlogic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
