Sorry for not being familiar with the LibGDX release cycle, but is this released yet in 1.9.10? Or is there at \"latest branch\". I recently updated LibGDX to 1.9.10 and am having the same issue with all my maps. Thanks.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/573385487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kennycason","id":2858428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTg0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2858428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason","html_url":"https://github.com/kennycason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennycason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2941042326,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk0MTA0MjMyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2941042326","actor":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-12T06:06:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2941042327,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NDEwNDIzMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/2941042327","actor":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-12T06:06:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/573445788","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5744#issuecomment-573445788","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5744","id":573445788,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzQ0NTc4OA==","user":{"login":"mgsx-dev","id":8074238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8074238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/mgsx-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgsx-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-12T18:55:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-12T18:55:56Z","body":"@kennycason
