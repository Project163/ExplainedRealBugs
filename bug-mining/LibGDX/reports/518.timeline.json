I have found a version of matrix decomposition where the sign of MM0 is used for scale.x and sign of M10 is used for scale.y - I don't know if it's correct though. The code would look like that then:\n\n```\npublic Vector2 getScale (Vector2 scale) {\n        float[] val = this.val;\n        scale.x = (float)(Math.signum(val[M00])*Math.sqrt(val[M00] * val[M00] +
