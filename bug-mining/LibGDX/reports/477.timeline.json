is a pain to make it nice in Java, eg:\r\nhttps://www.sitepoint.com/self-types-with-javas-generics/\r\n\r\nHowever, I also often use Node subclasses and agree it's not great having a mix of Node and CustomNode types. We can throw generics on it, with some quirks.\r\n\r\nSubclassing a node is done using `CustomNode extends BaseNode<CustomNode>`, which is a little odd. When _not_ using a custom tree node, we need to avoid the type `Node` from being a raw type, else existing code would break and you'd need to use `Node<Node>`, which is stupid looking. So we'll need to use an abstract class and declare Node using `Node extends BaseNode<Node>`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately existing code will break, but at least it is minimal. You will need to change:\r\n```\r\nTree tree = new Tree();\r\n```\r\nTo:\r\n```\r\nTree<Node> tree = new Tree();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis all kind of sucks, but it's certainly a lot nicer for UIs that subclass nodes.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/490946426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/490977646","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5627#issuecomment-490977646","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5627","id":490977646,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDk3NzY0Ng==","user":{"login":"Silobrlst","id":8915999,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTU5OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8915999?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst","html_url":"https://github.com/Silobrlst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Silobrlst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-09T16:38:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T16:38:16Z","body":"Thanks
