From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm):\r\n\r\n> \"Bresenham's algorithm chooses the integer y corresponding to the pixel center that is closest to the ideal (fractional) y for the same x; on successive columns y can remain the same or increase by 1.\"\r\n\r\nThis is one way to solve the problem. Imho, it is a very good way. ~libgdx doesn't do it that way. I think we should change it.~ It appears (to me at least) that libgdx might be doing it that way, but I could be wrong or there could be a better way. I'm happy to review and comment on a PR, but I don't have power to accept changes.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the examples posted, it seems libgdx's implementation might meet Wikipedia's definition, depending on where the line starts / ends. Or the difference *could* be a simple rounding difference (solely based on the posted example, I haven't reviewed either implementation.)\r\n\r\nSee below example, along with comments on what I bet libgdx is doing.\r\n\r\n```\r\ny - 9.5 = (10.5 - 6.5) / (11.5 - 8.5) (x - 8.5)\r\ny = 1.5x - 6.25\r\n\r\n    567890 (11,10)\r\n     ......\r\n   9 ....#.   center of line at (10.5, 9.5)\r\n   8 ....#.   line crosses y = 8.5 at x = 9.833   (rounded UP to 10)\r\n   7 ...#..   line crosses y = 7.5 at x = 9.166     (rounded DOWN to 9)\r\n   6 ..#...   center of line at (8.5, 6.5)\r\n     ......   \r\n(6,5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: Based on rosetta code, it looks like they *might* be using integer division or flooring the result.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: ... or they might be using different line endpoints... also I won't post again on this issue without reviewing the code.

it implemented something else, and couldn't complete some common lines, like any 2-point diagonal line. The Bresenham2 test is now much more robust, and can be used to preview any line from the center of a 160x120 area to anywhere in that area. If green is ever visible in the test's line, that means there's some discrepancy between the actual algorithm and what Bresenham2 implements; so far I haven't seen any green and this can connect all lines.
