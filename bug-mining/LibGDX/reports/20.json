The Image is painted after being added into the stage and after call the draw method on the stage.\n\n// Ok\nImage demo = new Image(textureObject);\n\nBut when I create an Image object using the constructor without parameters and I indicate a texture object using method setDrawable, the image is not draw.\n\n// Image is not drawed\nImage demo = new Image();\ndemo.setDrawable(new SpriteDrawable(new Sprite(textureObject)));\n\n// Using a TextureDrawable dows not correct this bug\nImage demo = new Image();\ndemo.setDrawable(new TextureRegionDrawable(new TextureRegion(textureObject)));\n\nParameter code for setDrawable method has been copied from the constructor of Image.\n\nIf I create an Image object with one Texture in its constructor and, then, I call to setDrawable with a different texture, then the first texture is painted, not the second one.\n\nIf this is a bug I can try to correct by myself and propose a pull request.
