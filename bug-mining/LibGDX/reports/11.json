Maybe the exception should be more specific? As far as I can see, right now it doesn't say anywhere in docs what exactly does the third argument mean (except one well-hidden place in the tutorials). I personally have mistaken it for the texture file's name and spent a whole hour trying to understand how comes that the package.png is generated and at the same time a seemingly unrelated exception is thrown.\n\nError log: \n\n```\nPacking.........\nWriting 1024x128: pack/package.png\nException in thread \"LWJGL Application\" java.lang.RuntimeException: Error packing files.\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.tools.imagepacker.TexturePacker2.process(TexturePacker2.java:557)\n    at org.tendiwa.client.GameScreen.<init>(GameScreen.java:19)\n    at org.tendiwa.client.TendiwaGame.create(TendiwaGame.java:16)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication.mainLoop(LwjglApplication.java:136)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication$1.run(LwjglApplication.java:114)\nCaused by: java.lang.Exception: Error processing directory:\n/home/suseika/Projects/tendiwa/server/modules/images/objects\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.tools.FileProcessor.process(FileProcessor.java:156)\n    at     com.badlogic.gdx.tools.imagepacker.TexturePackerFileProcessor.process(TexturePackerFileProcessor.java:120)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.tools.FileProcessor.process(FileProcessor.java:120)\n    at     com.badlogic.gdx.tools.imagepacker.TexturePackerFileProcessor.process(TexturePackerFileProcessor.java:99)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.tools.imagepacker.TexturePacker2.process(TexturePacker2.java:555)\n    ... 4 more\nCaused by: com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: Error reading pack file: pack/package.png\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureAtlas$TextureAtlasData.<init>(TextureAtlas.java:177)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.tools.imagepacker.TexturePacker2.writePackFile(TexturePacker2.java:263)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.tools.imagepacker.TexturePacker2.pack(TexturePacker2.java:86)\n    at     com.badlogic.gdx.tools.imagepacker.TexturePackerFileProcessor.processDir(TexturePackerFileProcessor.java:157)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.tools.FileProcessor.process(FileProcessor.java:154)\n        ... 8 more\nCaused by: com.badlogic.gdx.utils.GdxRuntimeException: Invalid line: \u001A\u001A\u001A\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureAtlas.readValue(TextureAtlas.java:425)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.TextureAtlas$TextureAtlasData.<init>(TextureAtlas.java:110)\n    ... 12 more\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
