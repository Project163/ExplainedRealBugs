GWT if you destroy a body with joints before destroying the joints, the joints will not properly destroy, causing a runtime error.\n\nThis problem doesn't appear to occur in Desktop.\n\nAccording to iforce2d.net, when a body is destroyed, its joints should be cleaned up automatically:\nhttp://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/joints-overview  See \"Cleaning up\"\n\nThe runtime error happens in the debug renderer.\n\n```\nGwtApplication: exception: (TypeError)\n stack: TypeError: Cannot read property 'body_0' of null\n     at $getTransform\n     at $drawJoint\n     at $renderBodies\n```\n\nExample
