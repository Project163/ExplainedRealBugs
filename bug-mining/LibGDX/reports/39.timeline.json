It seems to be related to the fact that you model reference the SAME texture several times (convert it to g3dj and check in notepad).\n\nLet's imagine that we have a 3D model which is referencing the SAME texture several times. Yes, it is not optimal and we can can optimize it in Blender, but just let's imagine. In this case ModelLoader will return dependency array with several entrance of the same texture. And it will be loaded several times. And then we will have troubles (message from AssetLoader) during unloading, because it will try to unload the texture will the same name several times. Possibly also a leakage here.\n\nAs for me I solved this problems with a fast&dirty solution. I use the simple function that cleanups the dependency array right after it is returned by the loader and before it goes to the AssetManager. Like:\n\npublic static Array cleanUpDependencies(final Array deps)\n{\n// search and remove if duplicated\nOUTER:\nfor (int i = deps.size; i-- > 0; ) {\nfinal AssetDescriptor dep = deps.get(i);\nfor (int j = i; j-- > 0; ) {\nfinal AssetDescriptor dep2 = deps.get(j);\nif (dep.fileName.equals(dep2.fileName) && dep.type == dep2.type) {\ndeps.removeIndex(i);\ncontinue OUTER;\n}\n}\n}\n\nreturn deps;\n}\n\nFor me it iwas not the problem because I have anyway to fix ModelLoader to enable MapMapping and setting texture formats. But for other it can matter.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/34190785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"titovmaxim","id":1524918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim","html_url":"https://github.com/titovmaxim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titovmaxim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":91006417,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTEwMDY0MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/91006417","actor":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"14ac0c9639880a10c50c85e83236351cd996c986","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/commits/14ac0c9639880a10c50c85e83236351cd996c986","created_at":"2014-02-05T16:12:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/34199274","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1185#issuecomment-34199274","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/1185","id":34199274,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTk5Mjc0","user":{"login":"NathanSweet","id":434010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet","html_url":"https://github.com/NathanSweet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NathanSweet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-05T16:15:54Z","updated_at":"2014-02-05T16:15:54Z","body":"Thanks @titovmaxim for the reason why it happens.
