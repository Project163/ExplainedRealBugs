I updated my Snapshot and found my app could no longer find files saved on the device, turns out because Gdx.files.external now points to a different location (on Android).\r\n\r\nThis commit (a73cfa012eec5a647bc52274c5557948bad67aa3)\r\n\r\nI understand the reasoning, but I feel like with already-established apps like mine and many others, Gdx.files.external has been understood to point to the root of the external storage since, basically forever.\r\n\r\nMy app is very user-generated-files based and I have a /AppName/ folder on the root directory with subfolders and all that, filled with saved data from my users. My app taps into these folders in many different areas of the UI. Right now all of my calls to Gdx.files.external(projectsFolder) for example no longer find anything because since this latest Snapshot it's pointing elsewhere (now to the /data/ folder of the app).\r\n\r\n**Which again I understand but, I feel like this should be made to be either a separate function at this point to avoid breaking existing apps or at least have some kind of setting to change desired behavior.** I'd like external to refer to external storage as it has before. Not to mention I have 2 apps that access and share the same /AppName/ folder and is of massive convenience for my Android users (iOS users not so much, as iOS cannot have this functionality - speaking of, the fact the /data/ is cleared when app is uninstalled is also a detriment to many of my Android users, again an issue only my iOS users were plagued with).\r\n\r\nAny chance of making this optional behavior and/or reverting to old behavior for Gdx.files.external? I see the reason for this commit was to fix issue #5633 but it seems as long as you request proper permissions and set up the FileProvider you're good - which seems reasonable?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13700427053,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAFH-b84agasZzwAAAAMwm-0t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/events/13700427053","actor":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a73cfa012eec5a647bc52274c5557948bad67aa3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Tom-Ski/libgdx/commits/a73cfa012eec5a647bc52274c5557948bad67aa3","created_at":"2024-07-30T19:26:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
