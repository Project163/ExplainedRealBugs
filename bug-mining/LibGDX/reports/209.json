So I defined a specific `BitmapFont` to be used in a specific `LabelStyle`:\n\n```\n    com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.BitmapFont: {\n        default-font: { file: irisUPC.fnt },\n        // setting markupEnabled does not work here\n        colored-font: { file: irisUPC.fnt, markupEnabled: true },\n    },\n```\n\nThe issue is `markupEnabled: true` is ignored.\n\nIt guess the issue happens because in `Skin` class the json<->`BitmapFont` serializer is replaced by a specific one that reads a few some hard-coded fields. Would it be possible to keep usual serializer behavior for other fields such as markupEnabled?\n\nI encountered the issue only with markupEnabled but it could also happen to other future fields.\n","closed_by":{"login":"davebaol","id":2366334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjYzMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2366334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol","html_url":"https://github.com/davebaol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davebaol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
