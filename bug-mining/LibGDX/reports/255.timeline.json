It also doesn't say it _can_ be reused after it - as such, it creates an obvious implementation dependence since it's an artifact, not a guaranteed API feature. Relaying on implementation-dependent behaviour, not guaranteed by API's contract is the easiest way to create WTFs as soon as the underlying lib implementation details change for any reason.\n\n> who seem to have implemented it wrong.\n\nI agree that the docs are ambiguous here, and I agree that `#finish()` _shouldn't_ close the DOS for the convenience of API user - and that AH/Android has taken the inconvenient route here... while e.g. RoboVM goes the same route as JDK source (and docs), Apache Harmony really has the test mentioned http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/harmony/enhanced/archive/classlib/java6/modules/archive/src/test/java/org/apache/harmony/archive/tests/java/util/zip/DeflaterOutputStreamTest.java - with `test_finish()` _explicitly_ requiring the writes to throw an exception after `#finish()`. Without any explicit Oracle JDK doc reference / test suite showing that it indeed _can_ be reused (If somebody has/knows of such info/link/test, I'd be very grateful to see it), we're basing the code on implementation details, not the API itself. It's your call, one way or the other, and I'm not saying that https://code.google.com/u/100542696791565253700/ has to be right on this, because the interpretations may vary. I'm just saying that relaying on UB is always a high risk strategy in my book.\n\nNB I understand that AH is retired etc.; still, disregarding AH stance on this is risky, as it shows that the implementation may (obviously) cause the code to fail on desktop on non-Oracle Java VMs/runtimes, if they went the same road as AH... not to mention that Android lib is based on AH itself.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/101396581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FyiurAmron","id":11016998,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDE2OTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11016998?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron","html_url":"https://github.com/FyiurAmron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FyiurAmron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/114893822","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3113#issuecomment-114893822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3113","id":114893822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNDg5MzgyMg==","user":{"login":"MobiDevelop","id":1095464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU0NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop","html_url":"https://github.com/MobiDevelop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MobiDevelop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-24T14:43:56Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T14:43:56Z","body":"I would generally interpret a method called `finish` to mean \"I am done with this and won't be using it again\", so would expect to not be able to use it again.

There is no undefined behavior here. The javadocs don't say the object is no longer usable, so an implementation that makes it no longer usable is wrong.\n\nThat said, I agree the allocation isn't a big deal.
