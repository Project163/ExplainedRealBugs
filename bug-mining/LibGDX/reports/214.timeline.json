In fact, the leak happens even if the sounds are never played. It seems like `preloadEffect` creates memory which is not returned when using `unloadEffect`. I also tried setting the soundBuffer to null in the dispose - no change there either.\n\nIt seems the only fix that is within libGDX that we could do here is removing the preload entirely. That's what we did for our game, and it doesn't seem to have a noticeable impact on sound performance for us. Maybe someone who is more familiar with the ObjectAL library could look into why the memory is not being freed when we call `unloadEffect`.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/77447549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ericnondahl","id":1621682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1621682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericnondahl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericnondahl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/comments/77481648","html_url":"https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2906#issuecomment-77481648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/2906","id":77481648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NDgxNjQ4","user":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-06T00:17:01Z","updated_at":"2015-03-06T00:17:01Z","body":"Thanks
