pull request for the simple fix.\n\nAbout the \"drift\" issue, I'm pretty sure it is related to the MP3 decoder / the way the audio is being streamed into the buffers since everything else works fine when using OGG and WAV files. (Disclaimer: I don't know anything about audio or OpenAL)\n\nI set up an experiment using the same song (in mp3 format originally) and converted to wav and ogg using Audacity. Then each frame in MusicTest render() I printed the total amount of buffers processed (because this determines how often the seconds per buffer is added to the total time in lwjgl.audio.OpenALMusic.update()) and also printed what getPosition() returns and what the elapsed time (using Gdx.graphics.deltaTime()) was.\n\nThe result was that a memorable part of the song occurs when 50 buffers have been processed (or 11.5 seconds into the song) for both the OGG and WAV files. But for the MP3 file this part of the song occurs after 55 buffers have been processed, and so getPosition() returns (seconds per buffer) \\* 55 which is going to be more than the amount of \"real\" time it takes to get to this part of the song. Just so no one is confused the OGG, WAV, and MP3 all take 11.5 seconds (real time) to get to this part in the song, but the MP3 file takes 5 more \"buffers processed\" to get there and since the seconds per buffer is always the same no matter the file type, getPosition() will return a value too big. \n\nSo I guess the question is why does the MP3 format take more buffers to get to the same part? Can it be fixed or can the seconds per buffer be adjusted for the MP3 format?\n\nHere are links to the output.\n(Note: MT = Music (getPosition()) time.
