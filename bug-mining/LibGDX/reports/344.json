(removing the rendering to a framebuffer from com.orangepixel.utils.arcadecanvas render()  makes it work again)\n\nproblem seems to be in framebuffers, possible the cause of the problem:\nhttps://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/ef0c210e9a26892e5b55baf2abd23bd60d13f448\n#### Version of LibGDX and/or relevant dependencies\n\n1.7.x works,  1.9.x doesn't\n#### Please select the affected platforms\n- [ ] Android\n- [X] iOS\n- [ ] HTML/GWT\n- [ ] Windows\n- [ ] Linux\n- [ ] MacOS\n","closed_by":{"login":"Tom-Ski","id":4346114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDYxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski","html_url":"https://github.com/Tom-Ski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tom-Ski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
