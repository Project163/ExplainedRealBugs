Those classes end up in Dagger, where they conflict with the version of Guava used by Dagger -- and, because of Maven's lack of support for `-processorpath`, with the version of Guava used by Dagger _users_ like Caliper.\n\nI don't know enough about Maven to say what the right thing here is. The easiest thing, I'd guess, is shading, but for all I know, this may be difficult with the Eclipse classes for some reason.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cushon","id":478458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/478458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon","html_url":"https://github.com/cushon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
