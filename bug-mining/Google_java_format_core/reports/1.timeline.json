there is a slight wrinkle, though.\n\nThe formatter cannot always tell whether an annotation is a type annotation\nor not. It will have to use a pretty gross heuristic. But for now, Google\nisn't on Java 8 yet, so it's going to always assume they are not type\nannotations (because they can't be), but of course it won't go so far as to\nphysically move them before the modifiers, so that people in your situation\nwon't get annoyed. At some point we will have to turn that on and, well,\nLiam could show you the proposal for how to guess at whether something is a\ntype annotation or not...\n\nOn Fri, May 15, 2015 at 7:06 AM, Kevin Bourrillion kevinb@google.com\nwrote:\n\n> I think it is a bug.

always want to format type annotations in-line:\n\n```\n@Nullable Object foo() {}\n```\n\nThis is tricky in contexts where type annotations could be mixed together with declaration annotations, such as field, method, and variable declarations. There's no syntactic information to we can use to distinguish between `@NullableType Object foo() {}` and `@Deprecated Object foo() {}`, but we want to output the first annotation in-line, and the second vertically.\n\nCurrently, we output ambiguous annotations as declaration annotations. This is fine for Java 7, and has the advantage of never incorrectly formatting a declaration annotation as a type annotation.\n\nHere are some possible heuristics we could use to support this case for Java 8:\n\n1) If the annotation occurs before a regular modifier, it's probably a declaration annotation:\n\n```\n@Deprecated\nstatic Object foo() {}\n```\n\n2) If the annotation occurs after regular modifiers, and it isn't on a void-returning method, it's probably a type annotation:\n\n```\nstatic @Nullable Object foo() {}\n```\n\n3) If the declaration isn't a void-returning method, and it has no regular modifiers, consider the existing formatting: type annotations are probably on the same line as the type, declaration annotations are probably vertical. (The risk here is that we'd preserve things like `@Override Object foo() {}`.)\n\n4) If the declaration is named `@Override`, it's probably a declaration annotation. This would offset the disadvantage of (3), but it could be confusing if `@Override` behaves differently than other annotations.\n\n5) An annotation with parameters is unlikely to be a type annotation, and should probably be formatted vertically.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"lorenzleutgeb","id":542154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjE1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/542154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb","html_url":"https://github.com/lorenzleutgeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lorenzleutgeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-17T10:14:33Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T10:14:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/google/google-java-format/issues/683","id":1044429719,"node_id":"I_kwDOAhznzM4-QLuX","number":683,"title":"Java
