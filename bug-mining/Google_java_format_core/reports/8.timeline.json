Here are a bunch of notes -- no doubt too many to digest easily but not nearly enough to fully specify behavior :)\n- [Indent continued `@tag` lines 4 spaces](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.1.3-javadoc-at-clauses) (or more, but we don't do \"align with something on previous line\" in code, so I don't see why we would do it here... though Eclipse does).\n- [Paragraphs have a \"blank\" line before them and no space between `<p>` and the following text.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.1.2-javadoc-paragraphs).\n- Presumably `<li>` tags likewise have no space between them and the following text, but presumably they do not have a blank line before. Would we actually remove such a line if it were present?\n- Do we have any interest in [reordering `@tags`](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.1.3-javadoc-at-clauses), or does that go beyond our \"only whitespace\" policy? (Well, I guess that our policy will have to be \"only whitespace and asterisks.\")\n- Don't touch anything inside `<pre>`. It might be code, or it might be fixed-width pseudo-tables or ASCII-art diagrams.\n- Possibly don't even insert a newline before `<pre>`, since Guava [likes to put it on the line with the preceding text](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/08a6bb421f0931cc4cee499a631c651e4633787e/guava/src/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableList.java#L614). But I think that pattern can work fine with a newline (or two) before `<pre>`, so we'll have to decide if it's worth a special case or not. Would we actually want to remove the newlines if they were already there?\n- Move text off the `/**` and `*/` lines [unless it is a one-liner](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.1.1-javadoc-multi-line).\n- Presumably we want to do something for other weird cases like _actual_ blank lines (no asterisk) and otherwise non-asterisked lines. Do we treat them as empty but asterisked, I guess? If they're inside a `<pre>`, we would ideally assume that they are otherwise aligned properly. But maybe we don't need to work that hard for an \"error\" case.\n- Do we already look for blank lines between Javadoc and the following methods/field/whatever? I guess I could check this myself.\n- This seems \"obvious,\" but the Eclipse formatter mangles it: Keep punctuation (`).,`) and HTML tags attached to the previous word (if they were already and maybe maybe maybe even if not), rather than pushing them to the following line. Otherwise, the line break shows up as a space before the punctuation or at the end of the link. Do the same for attaching HTML tags (and maybe punctuation?) to the _following_ word for the same reason. This can result in very long lines in the case of `<a href=\"...\">foo</a>`, since the only natural break is before `href`. If this upsets us, we can break between `\"...\"` and `>foo`. This works, but people may find it weird. And we'd want the formatter to be smart enough to remove that break when it's no longer necessary. (Update: Similarly, it would be nice to remove the space in `<a href=\\n\"blahblah\">` when it is no longer rnecessary.)\n- [We can break inside `@link` and `@code`](http://go/java-practices/javadoc#formatting_general). Eclipse doesn't, though, at least under some circumstances. Maybe it will break in `@linkplain` but not those two? I forget. I don't know if there's any value in following Eclipse in this small way, since we're going to deviate from it in many others, but we could consider that. TODO: Check where within the method/class/field name it is valid to break inside `@link`. Is it only places where you would \"normally\" put a space, like between method parameters? Can you even do that, or are breaks permitted only in the following free-form text?\n- It would probably be nice to put `<!-- MOE:begin_intracomment_strip -->` and `<!-- MOE:end_intracomment_strip -->` each on a separate line. Maybe we can generalize this to do that with all HTML comments? Do HTML comments have other use cases in Javadoc?\n- Do we want to do any indentation with `<li>`? Some people seem to like this:\n  `\n  <ul>\n  <li>Blah blah blah blah blah\n      blah blah blah.\n  <li>Foo bar baz\n  </ul>\n  `\n  Possibly this gets more compelling once you have nested lists. Above I've indented 4 spaces, which is nice because of the alignment with the text after the `<li>`. Are there other tags \"like this?\" If so, 4 spaces might not be as perfect for them, but it's probably good enough -- if we want to do this indentation at all. And things may get weird if the list occurs inside a `@param` tag or something. (Guava does this at least once IIRC.)\n- Should we leave double line breaks (i.e., a \"blank\" line) alone, even if they don't have a `<p>` tag or a `<pre>` tag to justify keeping them apart? Presumably we want to do this in `/* */` comment blocks, but is it the right thing for Javadoc, since the text will all get smooshed together in one paragraph? But it may be annoying for people who are just writing Javadoc for private methods out of the goodness of their hearts and who are now seeing that Javadoc mangled by us because they didn't go to the greater trouble of writing `<p>` every so often. But maybe it's still a net win because it calls people's attention to broken \"real\" Javadoc? Alternatively, we could insert a `<p>` tag for them.... (We can at least remove blank lines at the top and bottom of the Javadoc, I think.)\n- Should we take a position on the number of spaces after a period? I think I've heard that two is \"right\" for monospace, and it looks like one in HTML, anyway. But most people seem to use one, as does Eclipse (at least in Google's configuration, IIRC).\n- We presumably don't want to [remove an initial `<p>` tag](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7.1.2-javadoc-paragraphs), but we could. (My presumption here and in some other items is based somewhat on the \"only whitespace\" policy. But I don't really have an opinion about whether we should follow that policy for Javadoc or not.)\n- We presumably don't want to [remove optional closing tags (`</p>`, `</li>`)](http://go/java-practices/javadoc#formatting_general), but we could.\n- We presumably don't want to [change `<strong>`, `<em>` to `<b>`, `<i>`](http://go/java-practices/javadoc#formatting_general), but we could.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/comments/185476516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/comments/185796920","html_url":"https://github.com/google/google-java-format/issues/7#issuecomment-185796920","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/7","id":185796920,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NTc5NjkyMA==","user":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-18T16:16:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T16:16:08Z","body":"Here's a weird edge case around MOE directives and `@tag` sections.\n\nAssuming that we put MOE directives on their own line, some Guava code would look like this:\n\n```\n   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if blah blah blah\n   *     blah blah\n   *     <!-- MOE:begin_intracomment_strip -->\n   * @deprecated Internal users should use {@link #foo}\n   *     instead because of such and such\n   *     <!-- MOE:end_intracomment_strip -->\n```\n\nIt might be better to have:\n\n```\n   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if blah blah blah\n   *     blah blah\n   * <!-- MOE:begin_intracomment_strip -->\n   * @deprecated Internal users should use {@link #foo}\n   *     instead because of such and such\n   * <!-- MOE:end_intracomment_strip -->\n```\n\nMaybe?\n\nIf so, what's the rule here?

So there's that :(\n\nTo present a false dichotomy:\n- Line breaking in comment paragraph source code is very important. Let's make the formatter do the right thing with one of those fancy text layout algorithms -- fully automatic so that programmers don't need to worry about it.\n- Line breaking in comment paragraph source code is somewhat important but not important enough to introduce potentially surprising or frustrating behavior over -- better to encourage users to accept the default formatting to save time rather than tweaking line breaks each time they edit a section of docs.\n\nI lean somewhat toward the second option, but really my primary goal is not to have to hand-tweak formatter output if I touch one of the specially wrapped comments :)\n\n(Obviously an alternative solution to that is to get over my own twitchiness over \"unnecessary\" ragged lines.

would like to argue against the formatter removing my closing HTML tags.\r\n\r\nI have no problem with the formatter changing my code as required to make it consistent to Google Java Style Guide, as

is reasonable to expect that it will not significantly change my code beyond what is required to make it consistent to Google Java Style Guide (and obviously reasonable generalizations of it). \r\n\r\nAs the formatter is declared to implement a given normative reference (the Google Java Style Guide), I think it would be clearer to refrain from adopting more opinionated decisions inside the formatter itself. These decisions should be taken at the level of the Google Java Style Guide.\r\n\r\nDesiring to omit closing HTML tags is, I suppose, a reasonable decision in some contexts, but desiring to have them is reasonable as well, and a very common behavior among web developers (as illustrated in several [StackOverflow discussions](https://stackoverflow.com/q/7125354) and in #61). Therefore, they should be left untouched.\r\n\r\nIf the designers want to make the formatter opinionated about some issue beyond what the normative reference prescribes, such as the closing tags, it should at least be clearly documented.\r\n\r\nIn issue #7, @cpovirk wrote: “We presumably don't want to remove optional closing tags (`</p>`, `</li>`), but we could.” I am not sure why this suggestion was not followed, or even whether it is a conscious collegial choice.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
