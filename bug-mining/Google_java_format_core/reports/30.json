Unfortunately Eclipse uses \"//$NON-NLS-x$\" comments to avoid internationalization warnings. If you add the space it does not work anymore. We have these all over the place in our codebase which prevents us of using versions of google-java-format later than 1.3.\r\nWould it be possible to handle this case? (maybe a solution is to check if the first character is alpha-numeric)\r\nAlternatively would there be a workaround for us with a setting.\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"cushon","id":478458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/478458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon","html_url":"https://github.com/cushon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
