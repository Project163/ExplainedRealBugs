I imagine that nearly everybody using google-java-format within a large organization maintains some sort of CI system to enforce that code is formatted properly. In any organization with more than a handful of developers, it is essential to ensure that every developer always submits code formatted to google-java-format's standards. Otherwise, there is no way to maintain a codebase's formatting without constantly causing merge conflicts for developers whenever a reformatting event takes place.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I view a validation mode as a hard requirement for use of google-java-format in a large organization.
