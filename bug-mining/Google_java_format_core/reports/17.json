If you call the formatter 10 times, then you end up with 20 newlines in each of these places.\n\nWe found this bug using the [\"padded cell\" functionality in Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/master/PADDEDCELL.md), which checks that `Formatter(Formatter(input)) == Formatter(input)`, and handles misbehaving rules by resolving cycles, ignoring divergence, etc.  Whenever a violation is found, it generates a set of files for reproducing the issue which demonstrate the cycle or divergence.\n\nThere's an [open PR on this project](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/pull/83) to point gradle users to this Spotless plugin.  People who use it will likely be able to find other helpful testcases, while insulating them from the bug in the short-term.\n\nIf you'd like to reproduce this for yourself, clone https://github.com/nedtwigg/incubator-geode, and checkout tag `Bug37`.  Run `gradlew spotlessCheck` and it'll tell you which files are divergent and the testcases will be in `build/spotless-diagnose-java`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cushon","id":478458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/478458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon","html_url":"https://github.com/cushon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cushon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/89/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/89/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
