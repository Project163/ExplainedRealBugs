Looking at the code related to `fieldAnnotationDirection` to me, it seems the implementation doesn't really match the comment associated with it:\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Should a field with a set of modifiers be declared with horizontal annotations? This is\r\n     * currently true if all annotations are marker annotations.\r\n     */\r\n\r\nThe comment talks about marker _annotations_, but the code deals with annotation _instances_ since `getAnnotations` is returning the expression tree of the code use, thus:\r\n\r\n    @Inject\r\n    @Inject(true)\r\n\r\nwould yield the first as a marker, the second not, and then you'd when up with formatted code like:\r\n\r\n    @Inject SomeThing something;\r\n    \r\n    @Inject(true)\r\n    SomethingOptionalThing someOptionalThing;\r\n\r\nwhich is.... inconsistent.\r\n\r\nShould not `fieldAnnotationDirection` look at the class definition of the annotations in question, so seeing what arguments are available. That way - @tbroyer's comment above would be correct for all annotations, I suspect it works for `@Value.Parameter` in my instance, because the annotation has default values, which I assume may be being returned from

as @lowasser says we don't have a way to look at the declaration of an annotation. There's related discussion in #5, where we'd like to make a distinction between type and declaration annotations.\r\n\r\nIf we always formatted annotations on fields one-per-line that would be consistent with methods, but inconsistent with parameters and locals.

annotation for which the effect of the current implementation is visible is Spring Boot's [`@MockBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/mock/mockito/MockBean.html), which optionally accepts a Mockito answer. Anonymized example from an internal code base (the non-anonmized line stays under 100 characters):\r\n```java\r\n@MockBean private SpringBean1 springBean1;\r\n@MockBean private SpringBean2 springBean2;\r\n@MockBean private SpringBean3 springBean3;\r\n@MockBean private SpringBean4 springBean4;\r\n\r\n@MockBean(answer = RETURNS_MOCKS)\r\nprivate SpringBean5 springBean5;\r\n\r\n@MockBean private SpringBean6 springBean6;\r\n@MockBean private SpringBean7 springBean7;\r\n@Autowired private SpringBean8 springBean8;\r\n```\r\nIn some other cases we have several beans that require a custom `answer`, amplifying the effect. In the extreme case a list such as the one above would take up 7 * 4 = 28 lines. In my experience this makes it significantly harder to parse those lines (subjectively, the result appears more \"chaotic\" than it really is).\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't have many concrete improvement suggestions. One thing I do suspect will improve the situation is to not _enforce_ the extra two empty lines around multi-line statements. I suspect that for field and variable declarations a compact representation works well enough, as in the \"99% case\" their complexity is very
