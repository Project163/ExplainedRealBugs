I tried both 1.3 (as is linked from the main README) and 1.5. With either of them I see the implementation added in `Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Formatter Implementation`, however there isn't a profile added to the \"Active Profile\" dropdown (which means Eclipse's profile is left as default). \r\n\r\nI opened a java class, autoformatted it, which used the google formatting (great). However, when I then added a new line it included a tab along with the spaces, when I press tab it actually tabs (vs. inserting spaces as indicated in the style)...\r\n\r\nAlso note when 1.5 is installed the  implementation dropdown still shows 1.4.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/260/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/google-java-format/issues/260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
