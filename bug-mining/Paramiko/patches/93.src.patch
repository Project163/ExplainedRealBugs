 Changelog
 =========
 
+- :bug:`2419` (fixed in :issue:`2421`) Massage our import of the TripleDES
+  cipher to support Cryptography >=43; this should prevent
+  ``CryptographyDeprecationWarning`` from appearing upon import. Thanks to
+  Erick Alejo for the report and Bryan Banda for the patch.
 - :bug:`2420` Modify a test-harness skiptest check to work with newer versions
   of Cryptography. Props to Paul Howarth for the patch.
 - :bug:`-` Tweak ``ext-info-(c|s)`` detection during KEXINIT protocol phase;
