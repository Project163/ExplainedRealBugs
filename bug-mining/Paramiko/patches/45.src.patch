 Changelog
 =========
 
+* :support:`854 backported` Fix incorrect docstring/param-list for
+  `Transport.auth_gssapi_keyex
+  <paramiko.transport.Transport.auth_gssapi_keyex>` so it matches the real
+  signature. Caught by ``@Score_Under``.
 * :bug:`681` Fix a Python3-specific bug re: the handling of read buffers when
   using ``ProxyCommand``. Thanks to Paul Kapp for catch & patch.
 * :support:`819 backported (>=1.15,<2.0)` Document how lacking ``gmp`` headers
