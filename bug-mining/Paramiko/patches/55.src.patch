 Changelog
 =========
 
-* :bug:`794` Finishing touches to support ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 and
-  ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 host keys. Thanks ``@ncoult`` and ``@kasdoe`` for
-  reports.
+* :bug:`794` (via :issue:`981`) Prior support for ``ecdsa-sha2-nistp(384|521)``

   configuration) and add a ``flake8`` step to the Travis config. Big thanks to
