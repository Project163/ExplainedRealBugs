As far as I can see the problem is in some (to me at least) quite odd code in message.py. In particular the function Message.get_int() treats the case where the leading byte is 0xff differently (and to my eye incorrectly). This in turn leads to the > 32-bit value for the uint32 being decoded, causing the Python integer overflow exception. That code path was exercised while decoding the sftp channel open response from the server because the server I connected to sent 0xffffffff as the window size. I coded a quick fix that for me at least makes my sftp work. I don't know enough about the ssh protocol encoding to know if I broke other stuff though. I also noticed in passing that there are two instances of the method get_size() in Message. Surely that's not correct? If someone familiar with the code could let me know if I'm on the right track (or not), I can submit a pr with my fix.

get_int (make it decode a 4-byte unsigned 32-bit integer) and remove extra copy of get_size.\n\nI came to the conclusion the existing implementation for get_int() was incorrect while investigating this issue : https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/353 but it is likely also causing other problems as well (e.g. hung sftp sessions) due to the server's channel window size being incorrectly decoded by the client.\n\nThis change reverts get_int() to the version prior to this commit: https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/commit/0e4ce3762a5b25c5d3eb89335495d3bb9054e3e7\n\nAlso remove a second redundant (and wrong) copy of the function get_size() that came from the same commit but was subsequently eclipsed by a good version in this merge (the good version is defined second in the

I recall correctly, the reason for the change to `add_int` and `get_int` was because the `_add` method automatically switched between `int` and an adaptive `int`/ `mpint` based on whether or not the number was and `int` or a `long`. There is no distinction between the two in Python 3 so this caused trouble. I moved the location and type of the check, but I see now that my solution conflated cases where the byte size was critical with cases where only the ability to transmit the proper value mattered. I believe I added `get_size` and `add_size` to handle explicit 32-bit values, but I didn't catch all of the places where that was necessary. Maybe we should be really explicit and have `add_int32`, `add_int64` and `add_adaptive_int`.\n\nSimply reverting to the older `add_int` would almost certainly break some things on Py3.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/71591454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scottkmaxwell","id":718149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODE0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell","html_url":"https://github.com/scottkmaxwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/71594935","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/353#issuecomment-71594935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/353","id":71594935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNTk0OTM1","user":{"login":"scottkmaxwell","id":718149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODE0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell","html_url":"https://github.com/scottkmaxwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottkmaxwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-27T06:13:58Z","updated_at":"2015-01-27T06:13:58Z","body":"I think the best solution will be having `add_int` and `get_int` perform their old function and to create a new `add_adaptive_int` and `get_adaptive_int` for use by the `add` method.
