To support other digest algorithms, KexGroup1 has a `hash_algo` class variable which defaults to `sha1`. In the `_parse_kexdh_reply` method (used when we are the client side of the exchange), this is correctly used like so to generate the hash:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        self.transport._set_K_H(K, self.hash_algo(hm.asbytes()).digest())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus allowing the sha256 and sha512 variants to substitute those algorithms. Unfortunately in `_parse_kexdh_init` (used when we are the server side of the exchange) we have the sha1 algorithm hardcoded rather than using `self.hash_algo`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        H = sha1(hm.asbytes()).digest()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should almost certainly be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        H = self.hash_algo(hm.asbytes()).digest()\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/1882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/1882/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
