Since the earlier fix branches into a test of `sock._closed` under Python 3, an `AttributeError` is raised:\n\n```\n  File \"/opt/virtenv/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/paramiko/client.py\", line 394, in close\n    self._transport.close()\n  File \"/opt/virtenv/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py\", line 645, in close\n    self.stop_thread()\n  File \"/opt/virtenv/3.5.2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py\", line 1550, in stop_thread\n    and not self.sock._closed and not self.packetizer.closed\nAttributeError: 'Channel' object has no attribute '_closed'\n```\n\nAs this user suggests, I think a simple `hasattr` test added to the mix ought to suffice; this would also help with situations where `socket.closed` becomes a real API (ISTR confusion on this point during dev of the earlier fix anyways - but that was probably Python 2 vs 3.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
