exist.)\n\nPerhaps an opt-in setting for \"skip ECDSA host keys in my known_hosts, I promise not to try connecting to any of those hosts\" but even that's kinda stretching it, IMO - too many options

They are both in Reviewed state and will go out in the next release cycle once I complete some more ticket triage. Users will need to nab the 1.15 release for the full fix as #298 requires dependency tweaking and isn't appropriate for a bugfix release.\n\nThanks again to everybody who reported & troubleshot this :)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/51646742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":150903935,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTUwOTAzOTM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/150903935","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-08-08T19:26:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/52553935","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/270#issuecomment-52553935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/270","id":52553935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTUzOTM1","user":{"login":"jan-matejka","id":455474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTQ3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/455474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka","html_url":"https://github.com/jan-matejka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jan-matejka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-18T20:57:10Z","updated_at":"2014-08-18T20:57:10Z","body":"fyi

Background\n\nWhile investigating some slow connection times for my employer, I narrowed our particular slowdown to public key authentication, and then specifically to the creation of the RSA algorithm object based on the key in question (a 2048-bit RSA key).\n\nSearching around for why this operation would be slow led me to https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/270#issuecomment-37074306 which mentions the hitherto unknown to me 'slowmath' concept in PyCrypto.\n\nMore digging found this: https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/blob/7acba5f3a6ff10f1424c309d0d34d2b713233019/lib/Crypto/Util/number.py#L39-L53\n\ntl;dr you need `libgmp-dev`, `gmp-devel` or similar installed to trigger building/using of this `_fastmath.so` module; otherwise, you get a significantly slower Python implementation of the same logic.\n\nIn my local testing, a key that takes on average 2.5-3.5s to generate its `RSA` object with slowmath, takes only 0.5-0.9s with fastmath. Presumably all sorts of other operations (like regular transit encryption, vs authentication signing) are faster in this setup as well - I am still testing.\n## To do\n- [x] Add install documentation noting that if you install `libgmp-dev` etc, you may see significantly faster operations.\n- [ ] ~~Doublecheck exactly what appears faster so I can quantify that a little better~~ _meh_\n- [x] Sanity check whether the average distro-distributed/built paramiko/pycrypto seems to be enabling fastmath or not, so we can quantify whether this mostly impacts from-source users or not.
