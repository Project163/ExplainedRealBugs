Specifically, a race condition shown in `test_L_handshake_timeout`.\n\nThe other issue, centering on `test_3_multiple_key_files`, seems unrelated & received at least some workarounds/fixes mid-ticket, and should be considered closed for now.\n\nOriginal description follows.\n\n---\n\nThese were most often seen under Python 3.2, which has been nixed, but they pop up on other interpreters as well (for example https://travis-ci.org/paramiko/paramiko/builds/89238099 hit them 3 times in one build!) and it seems to be getting worse.\n\nThe problems appear to be most easily replicated under Python 3 but we've had at least a few confirmed reports of it occurring on Python 2 as well (though as per below comments I've been unable to reproduce it locally - only on Travis).\n\nThe specific examples that appear to occur are:\n- `test_L_handshake_timeout` fails with `AssertionError: EOFError not raised by connect`: https://travis-ci.org/paramiko/paramiko/jobs/89548222#L505\n- `No output has been received in the last 10 minutes` hangs/kills, often (always? needs lots of scanning) while running `test_3_multiple_key_files (test_client.SSHClientTest)`: https://travis-ci.org/paramiko/paramiko/jobs/89548214#L464\n","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
