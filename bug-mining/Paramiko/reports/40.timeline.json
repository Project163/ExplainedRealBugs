What you're experiencing looks like the opposite problem :)\n\n---\n\nI wasted a bunch of time proving that things are already \"correct\", with one annoying difference: I had a non-`none` value in my specific host block. So that worked just fine and I almost sent you on your way, until I saw...these lines: https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/04369de37e18167deccff70e2c77381d5d84ad23/paramiko/config.py#L78-L80\n\n_Welp._\n\nSure enough, #415 and the actual PR #433 simply excise/skip `ProxyCommand none`. Which is fine...until we hit your scenario where not having that `none` value allows later blocks to \"win\".\n\n---\n\nOffhand solutions that would avoid this problem & be more correct:\n- Set the value to Python `None` instead of the string `\"none\"`.\n  - Requires client code to be aware of this possibility instead of naively going \"is there a `ProxyCommand`? RUN IT\", which I'm sure at least some of it does now (Fabric possibly included - though we can of course change it there.)\n- Set the value to some sentinel (`None` or otherwise), then strip out the key/value pairs containing it at the end of parsing.\n  - This is more in line with the spirit of #433 and prevents clients from having to worry about changed behavior.\n  - But it feels slightly less clean to me, and continues to \"misrepresent\" the original source config file (given the author of the config file explicitly put a directive in which is no longer present in the parsed version).\n\nOpinions

Opinions accepted!\n\nI think there are two orthogonal issues to think through:\n1. Public API:\n   \n   I'm not familiar with paramiko's current API (my only experience is through Fabric), but I would've assumed something like the following behavior, when given my example config file:\n   \n   ``` py\n   result = parse_ssh_config(file, host=\"gateway\")\n   result.ProxyCommand\n   # None\n   \n   result = parse_ssh_config(file, host=\"other\")\n   result.ProxyCommand\n   # \"ssh -o ...\"\n   ```\n2. How to track `none`s internally to preserve the correct \"which host wins\" behavior\n   \n   In Haskell, I'd go to `Maybe` for something like this, with `Just None` taking precedence over `Nothing` for the purpose of deciding which host wins. They would be equivalent in the public API though, both resulting in whatever you decided meant \"no proxy command\".\n   \n   Is there something like this in

1: yes, that's why I was kinda leaning towards the \"change the behavior to be more correct/explicit\" option - it's definitely more in line with expectations. Only downside is it's backwards incompatible, so I would toss this into the 3.0 bucket (ETA: by PyCon-US or soon thereafter) if I go this route.\n\n(Alternately, we could do it in two steps, go the \"strip more correctly\" route now as a straight bugfix, then update it to leave the `None`s in place in 3.0. Depends on how badly you want this fixed before then :D)\n\nRe 2: naw, Python doesn't have as \"rich\" a value structure as Haskell, `None` is basically it for \"built-in\" values meaning \"not some actual value\".\n\nSometimes folks use locally defined classes/instances when they need something that can't be confused with `None` (i.e. if `None` is itself a legit value for a field storing, say, results of function calls, and so you need a way to truly specify \"no value was given, not even `None`).\n\nBut that's not ridiculously Pythonic and in this case there's no chance for confusion since the only extant values in the parsed config are strings or ints/floats.

Most of this work would not be wasted (IMO) as it's getting your internals in order, with just some compatibility code at the edges.\n\nLater, ship a backwards-incompatible fix that removes the filtering and returns a truer representation of the config by include the keys with `None` values.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/214529674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pbrisbin","id":50812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin","html_url":"https://github.com/pbrisbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/214576237","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/670#issuecomment-214576237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/670","id":214576237,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDU3NjIzNw==","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T01:00:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T01:00:01Z","body":"Yes, that's exactly it.

from #670.\n\nFor that ticket, we updated the implementation to insert `None` (including a handful of spots that needed updating to not assume all values were list-like) and then stripped it out at the last minute to preserve backwards compatibility.\n\nBoth myself & original submitter agree that it's cleanest to actually expose `ProxyCommand none` as `{'proxycommand': None}`, so this ticket is for doing that in a backwards incompatible release (3.0).\n\nShould be as easy as nuking the 2-3 lines noting `# TODO: ... #670` in `paramiko/config.py`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/732/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/214769841","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/670#issuecomment-214769841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/670","id":214769841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDc2OTg0MQ==","user":{"login":"pbrisbin","id":50812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin","html_url":"https://github.com/pbrisbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T14:47:53Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T14:47:53Z","body":"Thanks!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/214769841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pbrisbin","id":50812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin","html_url":"https://github.com/pbrisbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbrisbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1667886902,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2Njc4ODY5MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/1667886902","actor":{"login":"dkhapun","id":9967552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Njc1NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9967552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun","html_url":"https://github.com/dkhapun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f9a2382f64e3ebd65b04fe8a5c4a41016ba6c608","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cyberx-labs/paramiko/commits/f9a2382f64e3ebd65b04fe8a5c4a41016ba6c608","created_at":"2018-06-07T08:00:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
