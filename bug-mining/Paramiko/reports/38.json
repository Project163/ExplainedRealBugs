you try pickling and then unpickling NoValidConnectionError, you get the following exception:\n`TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)`\n\nIt seems to be passing the errno and string with the error message while init expects a dict.\n\nHere is some simple code to reproduce the issue:\n\n``` python\nfrom paramiko import ssh_exception.NoValidConnectionsError\nimport pickle\nerr = NoValidConnectionsError({'ab': ''})\np = pickle.dumps(err)\nunpickled = pickle.loads(p)\n```\n\nA more practical application is for example if you are using the multiprocessing module and a child process raises a NoValidConnectionError.\n","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
