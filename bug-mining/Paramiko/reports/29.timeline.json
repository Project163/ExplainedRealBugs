the `~.ssh/known_hosts` file contains an invalid entry (in my case, caused by a missing newline) then PyEZ will only return the nondescript `ConnectError` message.\n\nThe failure comes from the **ncclient** `manager.connect()` function which, in turn, calls **paramiko**'s `load_known_hosts()`. The latter actually returns a clear error message:\n\n```\nInvalidHostKey: ('172.22.196.114 ssh-rsa AAAA...\n    <snip />\n    ...+SQ==', Error('Incorrect padding',))\n```\n\nI think there are 2 issues here:\n1. **ncclient** `manager.connect()` takes several arguments, one of which is `hostkey_verify` which we set to `False` so I believe we should not even be loading the `known_hosts` file. I played with different parameters and we always seem to be performing this verification - this is a ncclient bug in my opinion.\n2. PyEZ obfuscates the error by using the generic ConnectError message - this occurs in the following bit of code in the `device.py` file:\n\n``` python\n        except Exception as err:\n            # anything else, we will re-raise as a\n            # generic ConnectError\n            cnx_err = EzErrors.ConnectError(self)\n            cnx_err._orig = err\n            raise cnx_err\n```\n\nIf we were to `raise cnx_err._orig` instead then we would have a clearer picture of what's going on.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Juniper/py-junos-eznc/issues/349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Juniper/py-junos-eznc/issues/349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/76493231","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/490#issuecomment-76493231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/490","id":76493231,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NDkzMjMx","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-27T23:38:05Z","updated_at":"2015-02-27T23:38:31Z","body":"Fair point.
