Then export the locale with the `LANG` envvar and call `setlocale(LC_ALL, '')` or similar in the server process. Finally, list a directory with files of suitable vintage. For French, the abbreviated month names 'févr.' 'août' and 'déc.' will trigger the problem.\r\n\r\nOn the server side, the following traceback is recorded:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_server.py\", line 111, in start_subsystem\r\n    self._process(t, request_number, msg)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_server.py\", line 386, in _process\r\n    self._read_folder(request_number, folder)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_server.py\", line 239, in _read_folder\r\n    msg.add_string(attr)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/message.py\", line 273, in add_string\r\n    s = asbytes(s)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/common.py\", line 170, in asbytes\r\n    raise Exception('Unknown type')\r\nException: Unknown type\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr with code is modified to allow the original exception to propagate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_server.py\", line 111, in start_subsystem\r\n    self._process(t, request_number, msg)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_server.py\", line 386, in _process\r\n    self._read_folder(request_number, folder)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_server.py\", line 239, in _read_folder\r\n    msg.add_string(attr)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/message.py\", line 273, in add_string\r\n    s = asbytes(s)\r\n  File \".../paramiko/common.py\", line 168, in asbytes\r\n    s = s.asbytes()\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_attr.py\", line 223, in asbytes\r\n    return b(str(self))\r\n  File \".../paramiko/sftp_attr.py\", line 220, in __str__\r\n    return '%s   1 %-8d %-8d %8d %-12s %s' % (ks, uid, gid, size, datestr, filename)\r\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xb7 in position 47: ordinal not in range(128)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution is to decode the result from [`time.strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) as the documentation suggests. For Python 3, this has already been done by the standard library so the issue does not appear. Another way to avoid the issue is using a language neutral locale like `C.UTF-8`.","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
