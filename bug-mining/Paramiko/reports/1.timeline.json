noticed that the parser that handles the records of known_hosts file is rather simplistic and is unable to handle more general cases used by \"real\" ssh. In particular the problem is with the routine HostKeyEntry.from_line() that has been that way since 2006 (looking at Git history). Some limitations include:\n\n(1) inability to handle multiple spaces as field separator -- they should be valid\n(2) apparently, hashed keys are not supported (yet)\n\nI would like to submit a few patches to address these issues.\n\nTo address (1) it is actually as simple as replacing this statement:\n\nfields = line.split(' ')\n\nto:\n\nfields = line.split()\n\n(currently on line 55 of hostkeys.py).
