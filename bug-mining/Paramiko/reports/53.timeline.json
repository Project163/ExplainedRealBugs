I can't use ios_command at all under these conditions. I tried to use \"transport = ssh\" but it looks like ios_\\* commands are only using paramiko. I've been able to send a 'show version' to my device thru a ssh command in the raw module so I guess the problem could be fixed by either allowing the use of ssh transport or by fixing something wrong with paramiko using key thru agent to connect to a Catalyst 3750-E.\n##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE\n\n<!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->\n\n```\n\n---\n- hosts: ios\n  gather_facts: no\n  connection: local\n\n  tasks:\n\n  - name: RUN 'raw SHOW VERSION'\n    raw: ssh admin@[3750E_IP] 'show version'\n\n  - name: RUN 'SHOW VERSION'\n    ios_command:\n      host: \"{{ ansible_host}}\"\n      commands:\n        - show version\n```\n\n<!--- You can also paste gist.github.com links for larger files -->\n##### EXPECTED RESULTS\n\nI expect the ssh connection to work and the \"show version\" command to return its content....\n##### ACTUAL RESULTS\n\nThe command thru the raw module is working (using transport = ssh)\n\nThe command using the ios_command is failing:\nAn error \"raise SSHException('No authentication methods available')\\nparamiko.ssh_exception.SSHException: No authentication methods available\\n\"\n\n<!--- Paste verbatim command output between quotes below -->\n\n```\n<!--- What actually happened?
