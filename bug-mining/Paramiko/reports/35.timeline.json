run into an issue in Fabric that appears to be caused by the way Paramiko parses SSH configuration files (such as /home/$USER/.ssh/config). In [paramiko.config.SSHConfig.parse](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/master/paramiko/config.py#L60) it looks like only trailing newlines (`\\r\\n`) are stripped. This means that any errant trailing spaces in an SSH configuration file cause issues. An example of a line that would cause an issue is below. Note that the `_` in the file name below would be a space in the real file.\n\n```\nHost *.dev.example.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my-dev-key_\n```\n\nIn the case of a file like the above, an attempt would be made to read the key out of the file '/home/someuser/.ssh/my-dev-key ', which doesn't exist. \n\nI consulted the man page referenced in `config.py` (`man ssh_config`) and couldn't find any mention of trailing spaces one way or another. However, the OpenSSH client appears to strip any [trailing whitespace](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/readconf.c#L794).\n\nWould you accept a PR to change `line.rstrip('\\r\\n').lstrip()` to `line.strip()` in `paramiko.config.SSHConfig.parse`?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/653/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/170096426","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/499#issuecomment-170096426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/499","id":170096426,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDA5NjQyNg==","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-08T19:12:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-08T19:12:29Z","body":"Thought I saw a recent patch about trailing whitespace, can't find it but still looking.\n\nDid find #375 which implies we _did_ want this behavior but there's no actual rationale listed... \n\nEDIT: yea, there's a test that #375 was just making sure didn't get accidentally broken: https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/ade0c259ee1ad630a53998c77ce1d852e417aa50/tests/test_util.py#L113 - walking down the blame on that line leads me back to 02e81785104d97e0634e5a41e87f3b083ea0e952 ca 2006 by robey, which clearly means it's been \"intended\" behavior since the beginning of the codebase or near enough.\n\nMay dig farther in case there is rationale but usually code that old doesn't have a solid reason in the commit message. I honestly can't think of many reasons why trailing whitespace is something anybody wants, and as per #653's investigation, OpenSSH itself performs trailing whitespace stripping.\n\nPondering whether we should be super careful re: backwards compat, and fix this in the upcoming 2.0 release. But my gut says it's probably hurting many more people than it could possibly be helping, so maybe treating as a regular bug is the right

is similar to #305 and #619, which relate to the ssh host, whereas this relates to ssh user.\n# Summary:\n\nA trailing space in the ssh user will be passed on to the ssh connection process, leading to a failed connection attempt.  This is true for trailing spaces in the User value for a host in .ssh/config, leading to the confusing situation in which `ssh example.com` connects properly, but `fab mytask -H example.com` fails.\n# To reproduce\n\nssh-agent is running with my key for the remote server, as you'll see in the results of the `ssh` command below.\n\n```\n$ cat fabfile\nfrom fabric.api import *\nenv.use_ssh_config = True\n\n@task\ndef test_fab():\n    run('pwd')\n$ cat ~/.ssh/config\nHost mie\n  Hostname A.B.C.D # redacted IP address\n  # note the trailing whitespace on the next line:\n  User allen \n$ ssh mie\nLast login: Thu Jun 25 14:38:13 2015 from W.X.Y.Z\nallen@mie:~$ exit\nlogout\nConnection to A.B.C.D closed.\n$ fab test_fab -H mie\n[mie] Executing task 'test_fab'\n[mie] run: pwd\n[mie] Passphrase for private key: \n```\n\nIf I remove the trailing space from the User value in .ssh/config, there's no problem connecting with fabric:\n\n```\n$ cat ~/.ssh/config\nHost mie\n  Hostname A.B.C.D # redacted IP address\n  # No more trailing whitespace on the next line:\n  User allen\n$ ssh mie\nLast login: Thu Jun 25 14:38:13 2015 from W.X.Y.Z\nallen@mie:~$ exit\nlogout\nConnection to A.B.C.D closed.\n$ fab test_fab -H mie\n[mie] Executing task 'test_fab'\n[mie] run: pwd\n[mie] out: /home/allen\n[mie] out: \n\n\nDone.\n```\n\nI also tried adding `env.user = \"allen\"` to fabfile.py, allowing for a successful connection. But changing that to `env.user = \"allen \"` results in the same type of failure shown above. \n\nPerhaps adding a trailing space inside the quotations when setting env.user is \"asking for trouble\" in that it should be fairly obvious and will also fail consistently.  Trailing spaces in .ssh/config, however, are not as obvious and will also not fail when connecting directly with `ssh`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric/fabric/issues/1346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabric/fabric/issues/1346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1667886884,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2Njc4ODY4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/1667886884","actor":{"login":"dkhapun","id":9967552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Njc1NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9967552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun","html_url":"https://github.com/dkhapun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkhapun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9c2d85791f7c58665fd09911b3cfee8c38c75476","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cyberx-labs/paramiko/commits/9c2d85791f7c58665fd09911b3cfee8c38c75476","created_at":"2018-06-07T08:00:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
