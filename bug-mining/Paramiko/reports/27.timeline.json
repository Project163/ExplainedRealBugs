looks good overall (haven't tried it out yet though). I have one nitpick/question, hopefully I'm just blind, but the above patches from @Bluehorn would seem to swallow _all_ connection refused / host unreachable errors -- including valid ones.\n\nIn other words, it doesn't seem to handle the case where the given host is truly unreachable or not speaking on the port in question. We need a test after the loop ends to determine whether the loop connected OK or if it failed, which implies storing the exception in a variable.\n\nGiven there seems no reliable `socket.connected` test (unless I'm missing something) we can't e.g. `if not socket.connected and exception is not None:`, so I think we need to detect if the final iteration of the loop generated an exception. (Which means turning the generator output into a list so we know its length, but oh well, it's not like it _needs_ to be a lazy iteration with so few members, eh?)\n\nIf @Bluehorn is no longer actively following this I'll get to it myself at some point; otherwise a proper pull request with his patches + the above tweak would be awesome :)
