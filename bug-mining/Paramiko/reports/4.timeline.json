Hopefully not, but still less than ideal.\n\nI think a better solution is to move the size incrementing along with the callback test; that preserves the old behavior in the case where the file is not zero bytes, but still gives us the \"calls `callback` once with 0/0 args\" behavior you need added. Testing this now.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/9434127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/9434163","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/90#issuecomment-9434163","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/90","id":9434163,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk0MzQxNjM=","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-15T04:44:18Z","updated_at":"2012-10-15T04:44:18Z","body":"Actually, it's even easier than that -- simply move the `break` test to the end of the loop.
