noticed Python chewing 100% CPU and transferring very slowly while using a host with ProxyCommand set.\n\nLooking at

It hammers `datetime.now()` (17% of total time) to get the time in milliseconds, which is a LOT slower than calling `time.time()`:\n\n```\ncadams@ganymede:~ $ python -m timeit -s 'from datetime import datetime' 'datetime.now()'\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.08 usec per loop\ncadams@ganymede:~ $ python -m timeit -s 'from time import time' 'time()'\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0801 usec per loop\n```\n\n(To avoid portability issues, `from timeit import default_timer` picks the best timer function on both Unix and Windows)\n1. The `select` call specifies `0.0` for the timeout, which causes the loop to endlessly churn reading only a few bytes in each call. It looks like simply calling select with `self.timeout` would match semantics with blocking behaviour by default.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":209281233,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwOTI4MTIzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/209281233","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c0520adbe5905af2befc85064b25f3ba0a39b019","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/commits/c0520adbe5905af2befc85064b25f3ba0a39b019","created_at":"2014-12-17T23:10:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":209282841,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwOTI4Mjg0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/209282841","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e5b105ca57b21b3142a80f29ee07e2a5e87ac547","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/commits/e5b105ca57b21b3142a80f29ee07e2a5e87ac547","created_at":"2014-12-17T23:13:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":209863128,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwOTg2MzEyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/209863128","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"741b4fbb9322a45282e86958c92b1b6706c07f8c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/commits/741b4fbb9322a45282e86958c92b1b6706c07f8c","created_at":"2014-12-18T21:53:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"pysnow530","id":9863744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjM3NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9863744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysnow530","html_url":"https://github.com/pysnow530","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysnow530/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysnow530/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysnow530/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pysnow530/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions
