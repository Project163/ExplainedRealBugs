about 3 different tickets that deal with this now. Search, people! Search! _sobbing noises_\r\n\r\nAlso, 2 of them muddy the waters by adding `AES-256-CBC` support, which I'd prefer to be a separate addition in the master/feature branch, because maintainership. The third had some (partially my fault) confusion around whether to handle the Cryptography API change with kid gloves or not.\r\n\r\nThus, none of them are one-click merge-able; I am hand-picking the necessary bits and then attempting to credit everybody involved.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWorkflow:\r\n\r\n- #912 added tests, which fail against 2.0 HEAD. Pulled those in first.\r\n- Added the fix that passes `password` into `_write_private_key` from `_write_private_key_file`, and now the tests surface the actual API breakage, which otherwise goes undetected due to logic branching.\r\n- Fixing the Crypto API, now I'm seeing why folks kept putting AES-256-CBC in...somehow the file is appearing as that, despite the tests only re-writing the fixture file they read in. Which is supposed to be DES-EDE3-CBC, an already-supported cipher. Wat.\r\n- OK, seems to be because Cryptography's openssl backend defaults to that particular cipher (if my super quick glance is right, it's literally what \"best available encryption\" means - a specific cipher name is stored that is manually curated over time).\r\n  - So even though we read a DES-EDE3-CBC file, we are writing an AES-256-CBC one. That's mildly irritating but probably worth considering a distinct issue, especially since one assumes we can consider it a security improvement.\r\n- I'm a little wary of _why_ we need to replicate that information (keysize, blocksize, mode) inside Paramiko - i.e. I wonder if the entirety of `_CIPHER_TABLE` and its single blob of references in this file, are legacy-ish and should be axed. Shouldn't it be available inside Cryptography in some form? Or are these very-specific-to-us choices about how to parameterize these ciphers? Still feels bad. Will dig.\r\n- With the cipher info inserted, test pass, as expected.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/306650829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/306650970","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/741#issuecomment-306650970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/741","id":306650970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjY1MDk3MA==","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-07T00:24:23Z","updated_at":"2017-06-07T00:24:23Z","body":"Regardless of the \"why do we need to tell ourselves about how to run these ciphers\" question, I think I am now mostly ok with considering the entirety of #912 a 2.0-level bugfix.
