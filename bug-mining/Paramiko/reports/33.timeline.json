Especially as this error may be non-obvious as it works at smaller output sizes and nothing enforces this ordering.\n\nAs an added detail, I used this ordering based on the logic that since recv_exit_status blocked until a command was complete according to the docs, it would guarantee that the command was complete and we had the full output before reading. I was not sure that just calling read without that would really ensure you had all the output.

For a large enough output, `recv_exit_status()` hangs. The fix was the same: call `stdout.channel.recv_exit_status()` _after_ calling `read()` on each of the output streams, instead of before.\n\nI found this confusing for the same reason that @kprantis did. The [doc for `recv_exit_status()`](http://docs.paramiko.org/en/1.15/api/channel.html#paramiko.channel.Channel.recv_exit_status) makes it sound like it's safe to call first since it waits until everything is done.\n\n> If the command hasn’t finished yet, this method will wait until it does, or until the channel is closed. If no exit status is provided by the server, -1 is returned.\n\n@bitprophet - Does it make sense to add a warning somewhere in the documentation about how large output can cause hangs if `read()` and `recv_exit_status()` are not called in the correct order? Or is there perhaps a bug in the behavior of  `recv_exit_status()`?\n\nI can work on a concise reproduction of the issue if it'll help you address this.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/159481997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":474077663,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc0MDc3NjYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/474077663","actor":{"login":"kprantis","id":1007568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis","html_url":"https://github.com/kprantis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-25T03:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":474077664,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NDA3NzY2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/474077664","actor":{"login":"kprantis","id":1007568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis","html_url":"https://github.com/kprantis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kprantis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-25T03:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":474077665,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc0MDc3NjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/474077665","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-25T03:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":474077666,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NDA3NzY2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issue

I'd say it's even money on \"intended and poorly documented behavior\" versus \"actual bug\". Could be either. Given the codebase's age, though, I think even if it's technically a bug, it's evolved into \"feature\" by now. Especially since changing this kind of thing (it's likely threading/lock related) is risk-heavy.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards \"add a `.. warning::` block to the docstring\". If you've time, please by all means check the code itself in case there's something blindingly obvious (or if it makes documenting the corner case clearer) and otherwise, a warning would be better

a concise reproduction of the issue:\n\n``` python\nimport sys\nimport paramiko\n\nprint(sys.version)\nprint(paramiko.__version__)\n\nclient = paramiko.client.SSHClient()\nclient.load_system_host_keys()\nclient.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.client.AutoAddPolicy())\n\nclient.connect(hostname='127.0.0.1')\noutput_len = 2097150\n\nwhile True:\n    stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command(\n        'printf %{}s'.format(output_len),\n        get_pty=True)\n\n    exit_status = stdout.channel.recv_exit_status()\n    stdout_output = stdout.read().decode('utf8').rstrip('\\n')\n\n    print(len(stdout_output))\n    output_len += 1\n```\n\nOn my system, the output I get is:\n\n```\n$ python3 paramiko-large-output-hang.py \n3.5.0 (default, Sep 23 2015, 04:42:00) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)]\n1.16.0\n2097150\n2097151\n2097152\n- hang -\n```\n\nSo the largest output Paramiko can handle when `recv_exit_status()` is called first is 2097152 bytes, which is exactly 2 MiB. Any larger than that and it hangs. If I move `recv_exit_status()` to after the `read()`, Paramiko sails past that limit without issue.\n\nSearching the codebase for 2097152, I found [this result](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/2a99a8c9a4bde66720e9357963ce1896830528a1/paramiko/transport.py#L271-L273), though I wouldn't know if it explains this behavior.\n\nI don't have time to dig further into this, but I can add the warning to `recv_exit_status()`'s documentation if that sounds good to you
