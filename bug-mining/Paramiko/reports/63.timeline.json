- you said:\r\n\r\n> I am not using the ed25519 private key explicitly\r\n\r\nCan you clarify this? What _are_ you explicitly using for auth in this situation, if anything? (I.e. what args are you giving to `connect`, are you allowing the SSH agent to operate and if so what's in it, what default-named key files are in your `~/.ssh/` and what format are those, etc etc.)\r\n\r\nI ask because this may be an issue with how Paramiko currently tries all key types in an arbitrary order for any given key file it's been asked to load. (Normally that doesn't explode in this particular way, but that's why I'm asking, to see if we can figure out exactly what key material is triggering it.)\r\n\r\nEDIT: if you enable debug-level stdlib logging and supply that output, that will also help as it will give at least some info about which keys are being tried when.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/323810502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1214584750,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTIxNDU4NDc1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/1214584750","actor":{"login":"tvannahl","id":662132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/662132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl","html_url":"https://github.com/tvannahl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-21T17:58:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1214584751,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyMTQ1ODQ3NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/1214584751","actor":{"login":"tvannahl","id":662132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/662132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl","html_url":"https://github.com/tvannahl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-21T17:58:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tvannahl","id":662132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjEzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/662132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl","html_url":"https://github.com/tvannahl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvannahl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-01T13:14:43Z","updated_at":"2017-09-01T13:14:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/issues/26146","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/issues/26146/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ansible/ansible/issues/26

And that's probably what this ticket should be \"about\". But I also don't know if your real problem is that you're trying to use that other RSA key you mention! :)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nback to @ploxiln - it seems like this could be the password _or_ the salt,
