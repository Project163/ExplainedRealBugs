before hanging is always the same for the same directory. I have checked this by having it skip some files, to test if it was the specific file or the number of files.\n\nWith a few different parent directories I tested with, it would hang on file 59, 60, 61 and 66, depending on the directory. It is always the same count for the same directory.\n\nWhen interrupting the program in this hung state, this is the stack trace:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test_ftp.py\", line 41, in <module>\n    para()\n  File \"test_ftp.py\", line 33, in para\n    recursive_download(\"plugins/jetpack\", \"/home/s/Desktop/wordpress-seo\")\n  File \"test_ftp.py\", line 31, in recursive_download\n    ftp.get(new_ftp_path, new_path)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/sftp_client.py\", line 720, in get\n    size = self.getfo(remotepath, fl, callback)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/sftp_client.py\", line 688, in getfo\n    with self.open(remotepath, 'rb') as fr:\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/sftp_client.py\", line 327, in open\n    t, msg = self._request(CMD_OPEN, filename, imode, attrblock)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/sftp_client.py\", line 728, in _request\n    num = self._async_request(type(None), t, *arg)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/sftp_client.py\", line 750, in _async_request\n    self._send_packet(t, msg)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/sftp.py\", line 170, in _send_packet\n    self._write_all(out)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/sftp.py\", line 133, in _write_all\n    n = self.sock.send(out)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/channel.py\", line 698, in send\n    return self._send(s, m)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/channel.py\", line 1059, in _send\n    size = self._wait_for_send_window(size)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/paramiko/channel.py\", line 1174, in _wait_for_send_window\n    self.out_buffer_cv.wait(timeout)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.4/threading.py\", line 290, in wait\n    waiter.acquire()\nKeyboardInterrupt\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/560/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/127721582","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/60#issuecomment-127721582","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/60","id":127721582,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzcyMTU4Mg==","user":{"login":"mynameiscfed","id":10454817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU0ODE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10454817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed","html_url":"https://github.com/mynameiscfed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mynameiscfed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T19:05:12Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T19:05:12Z","body":"Hi - I am experiencing similiar issues of performance using Paramiko and PySFTP libraries for SFTP downloads of files in the 30-40MB range. Using the package 6.6p1-2ubuntu2 for SFTP client in Ubuntu 14.04 is giving me about 4x better download speed. \n\nI have tried to actively debug this issue and tune some parameters but I cannot figure it out.
