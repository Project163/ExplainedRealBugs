(Wonder if it's a patched 7.4?)\r\n* The reason for this band-aid is that OpenSSH <=7.7 may not understand the RSA-SHA2 cert types (tho it _does_ understand RSA-SHA2 keys?)\r\n    * Plus those versions DO (or MAY) understand how to send server-sig-algs, and are offering SHA2 - implicitly, only for non-cert RSA keys.
