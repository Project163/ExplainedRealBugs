For example, the below seems like it should be a standard-enough use of the feature where I want to refer to short names but have settings in the file aimed at their matching FQDNs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCanonicalDomains paramiko.org\r\nCanonicalizeHostname yes\r\n\r\nHost www.paramiko.org\r\n    User shuttleworth\r\n\r\nHost *\r\n    User ewing\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy assumption was that `ssh random` gets user `ewing`, but `ssh www` would:\r\n\r\n- parse the file once\r\n- notice the canonicalization settings & resolve `www` to `www.paramiko.org`, setting `HostName` to that & triggering a second parse\r\n- load the `www.paramiko.org` Host stanza\r\n- set user to `shuttleworth`\r\n\r\nHowever, only the `HostName` update occurs; `User` is only ever set to `ewing` (going both by `ssh -F configfile -G <target>` and regular `ssh`ing). This threw me for a loop until I read the source and realized it's simply the \"I will never overwrite an options value I've already looked up\" behavior at work. The canonicalization re-parsing does _not_ invalidate this, as I had sort of assumed.\r\n\r\nBut this seems counterintuitive - is one simply disincentivized to ever use `Host *` or similarly broad globbing, when also using canonicalization? I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I've also worked with SSH configs for ages and if I'm getting confused, I have to believe the average user is too.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn the end of course, it's moot, I need to implement the OpenSSH behavior regardless - but I want to make sure I understand the actual use of the feature, or I'm likely to miss corner cases in my tests.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/525331210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/525407783","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/897#issuecomment-525407783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/897","id":525407783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTQwNzc4Mw==","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-27T17:40:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T17:40:53Z","body":"The above definitely isn't biting just me, see eg [this RedHat ticket](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1438326).

is done enough! What's obviously missing:\r\n\r\n- `CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs` - lots of fiddly coding/testing for a presumably less critical edge case, deferred\r\n- `Proxy(Command|Jump)` honoring of whether `CanonicalizeHostname` is `yes` or `always` - that's not Paramiko's own concern at this time but would be implemented in the downstream library, such as Fabric. (Fabric is not getting support for that at this time, which basically means that `yes` acts like `always`, for now, I think...)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/536066758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/536067674","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/897#issuecomment-536067674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/897","id":536067674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjA2NzY3NA==","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T19:25:23Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T19:25:23Z","body":"Also, when testing how this impacts `IdentityFile` I found an unreported bug around duplication in that value; eg say you had two stanzas that both applied and both said `IdentityFile foo` - you'd end up with `[\"foo\", \"foo\"]`.
