The analogous `ssh gateway ...` works fine.\n\nI've deduced that paramiko is using the wrong `ProxyCommand` -- it's using the one from `Host *` and not `Host gateway`. If I comment the `ProxyCommand` from the `Host *` block, the fabric command works.\n\nUsers with similar complaints are directed towards the documentation:\n\n> For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used. The configuration files contain sections separated by ``Host'' specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that match one of the patterns given in the specification.The matched host name is the one given on the command line.\n> \n> Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used, more host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.\n\nBut I think we're doing things right. The `Host gateway` definition is earlier, and it sets `ProxyCommand none` first. I'd expect that would be respected, as it is with normal `ssh` commands.\n\nVersion info:\n\n```\n% pip list | grep paramiko\nparamiko (1.16.0)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
