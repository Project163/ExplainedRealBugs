Apologies in advance for nit picking, but it has taken me some time to figure this out because of the documentation.  I love paramiko and a very good job, but...\n\nI have been spending quite some time over this python error \"AttributeError: 'SFTPClient' object has no attribute 'getfo'\", as in the up to date documentation, http://docs.paramiko.org/paramiko.SFTPClient-class.html#getfo says Since: 1.4.  Using 1.7.7.1, this function does not appear to exist and looking through the repo, seems to have been added only fairly recently.\n\nEven the notes for the added argument \"callback\" says 1.7.4, yet if this does not appear until sometime after 1.7.7.1, both version numbers seem inaccurate.  I guess this came about through a copy-paste error.  May I suggest adding a changelog to the website to make it clearer which changes got added and when?\n\nMany thanks,\nJack\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/17118387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OceanWolf","id":3758703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTg3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3758703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf","html_url":"https://github.com/OceanWolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OceanWolf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/17147063","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/160#issuecomment-17147063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/160","id":17147063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTQ3MDYz","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-29T01:40:15Z","updated_at":"2013-04-29T01:40:15Z","body":"Yikes, I set up http://docs.paramiko.org during the transition, but I don't see it in the README.
