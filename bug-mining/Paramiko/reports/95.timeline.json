far what I'm roughly doing as I remove:\n- regular code, straight removal of all mentions of DSS/DSA, unless part of ECDSA context obviously.\n- in docstrings etc I'm typically opting to replace very old \"RSA or DSA\" references with just \"key types\" generically\n- in tests:\n  - standalone cases (including list members in tests which iterate over a list of key types or identifiers) concerned solely with DSA, which have RSA or etc equivalents nearby: nuking\n  - standalone cases where DSA is the only key used (due to age, usually): replace with RSA for expediency\n  - cases involving both RSA and DSA: replace the DSA with

I'm creating an issue instead of a PR since I have no idea of the project standards/goals/directions. \n\nparamiko 4.0.0 was just released, and has [dropped support from DSA/DSS keys](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/973).\n\nThis breaks sftpretty's init [[1](https://github.com/byteskeptical/sftpretty/blob/b5555a7ec9276078bef6d2a7caffd13c22e3f501/sftpretty/__init__.py#L9)] (can also see dss references

[line](https://github.com/byteskeptical/sftpretty/blob/b5555a7ec9276078bef6d2a7caffd13c22e3f501/pyproject.toml#L28) to `'paramiko>=2.7.0,<4.0.0'`.\n\nRemoval of DSS support from future versions seems the only way to keep using the latest versions of paramiko.\n\nThank

you're using paramiko as part of another tool, which tool/version?\n\npysftp v0.29\n\n### Expected/desired behavior\n\nPerform a simple file transfer (PUT) to a MFT server over SFTP.

has been unmaintained since 2016 and general advice is to switch it out for a replacement SFTP package. `pysftp` is a high-level wrapper around `paramiko`, and `paramiko` docs recommend using `fabric` if you only need to use high-level functions.\n\n`pysftp` has the dependency `paramiko>=1.17.0`, which can cause sudden behaviour changes when new versions of `paramiko` are released. For example, a [breaking change](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/973) in `paramiko 4.0.0` caused workflow runs to start failing with an import error:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call

workflows being unusable, but we should avoid relying on outdated packages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thoth-pub/thoth-dissemination/issues/68/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thoth-pub/thoth-dissemination/issues/68/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/3151014232","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/973#issuecomment-3151014232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/973","id":3151014232,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAHTOc670KlY","user":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-04T14:34:47Z","updated_at":"2025-08-04T14:34:47Z","body":"This

v4.0.0 was released on **2025-Aug-03** - [https://www.paramiko.org/changelog.html](https://www.paramiko.org/changelog.html)\n\nAccording to the release notes, support as been removed for the DSA (aka DSS) key algorithm, citing that it is out-of-date/insecure.\n\nFurther information regarding Paramiko removal of DSA keys can be seen [here](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/973).\n\nCode within `ncclient` currently makes references to `paramiko.DSSKey` keys algorithms, which cause crash scenario's to occur, as this key type has been removed from Paramiko v4.0.0.\n\nSee following code section in `ncclient/transport/ssh.py` file as an example.\n\n```\nif hostkey_b64:\n    # If we need to connect with a specific hostkey, negotiate for only its type\n    hostkey_obj = None\n    for key_cls in [paramiko.DSSKey, paramiko.Ed25519Key, paramiko.RSAKey, paramiko.ECDSAKey]:  <<-- Reference to DSSKey\n        try:\n            hostkey_obj = key_cls(data=base64.b64decode(hostkey_b64))\n        except paramiko.SSHException:\n            # Not a key of this type - try the next\n            pass\n```\n\nPre 4.0.0 releases of Paramiko do not have this issue.\n\nWould it be possible for `ncclient` to be updated to support Paramiko v4.0.0 by removing support for DSA (DSS) keys?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ncclient/ncclient/issues/641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ncclient/ncclient/issues/641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"lmignon","id":544090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon","html_url":"https://github.com/lmignon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmignon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-18T09:49:06Z","updated_at":"2025-08-18T09:49:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OCA/storage/issues/500","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OCA/storage","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OCA/storage/issues/500/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OCA/storage/issues/500/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OCA/storage/issues/500/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OCA/storage/pull/500","id":3292533699,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCmfuIM6iKwTi","number":500,"title":"[FIX]
