Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. **When no _buffering_ argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows:**\r\n> \r\n> * Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on [`io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE). On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\r\n\r\nFrom this, I would assume that omitting `bufsize` would cause Paramiko to enable buffering, choosing its own size for the buffer. However, in the code for `BufferedFile`, we can see that this is not the case.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/blob/4300732c8c392cb246fc7b2839e3700732846fff/paramiko/file.py#L460-L475\r\n\r\nThis seems misleading to me. I'd suggest that one of these two options be taken:\r\n\r\n- Update the documentation to clarify that buffering is disabled by default\r\n- Update the behavior of `_set_mode` to enable buffering when `bufsize=-1` (potentially backwards incompatible)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/2000/reactions","total_count":20,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":7,"eyes":5},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/2000/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
