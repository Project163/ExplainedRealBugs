testing with Fabric==1.13.1, paramiko==2.1.1, cryptography==1.7.1\r\n\r\nThe default ssh server setup on ubuntu 16.04 (and probably most recent versions of ubuntu and debian) is to generate one of each kind of host key. The default `sshd_config` contains this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProtocol 2\r\n# HostKeys for protocol version 2\r\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\r\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\r\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\r\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the openssh client (6.9p1 on MacOS 10.11), it chooses the ecdsa key to put in `known_hosts`, and on later invocations it checks all the host keys the server presents to find the one of the appropriate type to check.\r\n\r\nBut paramiko seems to only look at the rsa one, sees that it's not the same type as what's in known_hosts, and so ignores it. Thus paramiko never notices when the host key changes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ssh testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net\r\n...\r\n@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @\r\n...\r\nSomeone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!\r\nIt is also possible that a host key has just been changed.\r\nThe fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is\r\nSHA256:aB6l8o7WhWdJ02tPavyPBGTFgqe1VaqwuLVfJttiQ/c.\r\n...\r\nOffending ECDSA key in /Users/pierce/.ssh/known_hosts:19\r\nECDSA host key for testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net has changed and you have requested strict checking.\r\nHost key verification failed.\r\n$ fab -H testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net basictask\r\n[testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net] Executing task 'basictask'\r\n[testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net] run: hostname && echo hi there\r\n[testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net] out: testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net\r\n[testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net] out: hi there\r\n...\r\nDisconnecting from testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net... done.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if I put an incorrect rsa key in known_hosts, paramiko correctly notices that the host key is wrong. Or, if I put an incorrect ecdsa key in known_hosts, and change `sshd_config` to only offer the ecdsa key, paramiko correctly notices that the host key is wrong.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ fab -H testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net basictask\r\n[testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net] Executing task 'basictask'\r\n[testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net] run: hostname && echo hi there\r\n\r\nFatal error: Host key for testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net did not match pre-existing key! Server's key was changed recently, or possible man-in-the-middle attack.\r\n\r\nUnderlying exception:\r\n    ('testdeploy03.ec2.st-av.net', <paramiko.ecdsakey.ECDSAKey object at 0x10c805310>, <paramiko.ecdsakey.ECDSAKey object at 0x10c7fb7d0>)\r\n\r\nAborting.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also works to hide the problem pointed out in #794 - if the ecdsa-sha2-nistp384/521 key is not the only host key, if there is also a dsa or rsa host key in sshd_config, then paramiko will use the rsa or dsa host key and will seem to work. (But if you had the ecdsa key in known_hosts, it's not being checked.)\r\n\r\n(As a final detail, recent openssh server and client will refuse to actually use the dsa key, I think it's obsolete.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/865/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/865/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-03T17:30:19Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T17:30:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/883","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/883/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/883/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/883/events","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/883","id":204825739,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ4MjU3Mzk=","number":883,"title":"Client

In short Paramiko 1.16.0-1 does not work with *ecdsa-sha2-nistp521* keys from *.ssh/known_hosts*. There is an [already fixed bug](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/794) about that in paramiko. Arista switches have such type of key and it will be offered to ssh first.\r\n\r\nWhen ssh adds automatically the node(Arista) ssh key to *.ssh/known_hosts* after simple logging into the Arista switch from bash\r\n```bash\r\nssh administrator@test-arista-sw\r\n```\r\n> The authenticity of host 'test-arista-sw (192.168.100.128)' can't be established.\r\n> ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:2CCjPqusOQ7wL8AvVXdM3968AClEQucxBXhVBTz1XH8.\r\n> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\r\n> Warning: Permanently added '192.168.100.128' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\r\n \r\nan *ecdsa-sha2-nistp521* host key is offered from the arista switch and added. Assuming we have already valid key for the host ansible should connect without problems. But\r\n```\r\nexport ANSIBLE_LOG_PATH=~/ansible.log\r\nexport ANSIBLE_DEBUG=True\r\nansible-playbook -vvvv get_arista_facts.yml\r\n```\r\nfails with \r\n> unable to open shell.
