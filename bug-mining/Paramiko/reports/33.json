From some minor testing, it seems related to the size of the output returned. \n\nConsider the script below, when NUM_LOOPS=3500, the command executes just fine, and in only about ~1 second. But If I increase it to 4000, then it just hangs indefinitely. The number it hangs on appears to vary with the size of the output (aka, I can get to at least 10k if I echo 'banana' instead). Of course, this could all be a red herring, but thought I'd include it in case relevant.\n\n```\nimport logging\nimport socket\nimport time\nimport paramiko\nimport re\n\n\ndef _ssh_address(address, command, timeout=30):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes a command on a remote server over ssh.\n\n    Sends a command over ssh to a remote machine and returns the stdout,\n    stderr, and exit status.
