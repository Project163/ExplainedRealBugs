Will try to document them here to see if a pattern emerges, we've already seen at least one repeat a few times.\n\nIt's highly likely this is the fault of the merge and not something specific to Travis, but I've yet to encounter (m)any of them locally. Will need to isolate & run tests in a loop to determine how to debug/prove fix.\n- [462.1](https://travis-ci.org/paramiko/paramiko/jobs/22958846#L571) - `test_B_generate_dss`, `AssertionError`\n  - Also [402.4](https://travis-ci.org/paramiko/paramiko/jobs/20742645#L569)\n- [400.3](https://travis-ci.org/paramiko/paramiko/jobs/20742448#L568) - `test_2_client_dsa`, `AuthenticationFailed`\n  - Saw this today but already reran that test cell so it's gone now. Definitely same exception, unsure if same test.\n  - @offbyone saw this on his laptop as well, but in `test_3_multiple_key_files`\n","closed_by":{"login":"bitprophet","id":6088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet","html_url":"https://github.com/bitprophet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitprophet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
