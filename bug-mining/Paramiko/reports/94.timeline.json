When switching to this library, we've encountered issues in getting the library functional in Ubuntu 14.04 (see https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/3441), which would make an upgrade of the library less trivial. \r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, let's wait for the Xenial migration, while closely monitoring advisories for the pyca/cryptography library. If another flaw is found, we can re-evaluate this decision.\r\n\r\n### Tails workstation\r\nUsed by Paramiko [2], which currently does not support GCM [3] (it's reasonable to assume that the AES GCM functions are not being used). However, there is no reason *not* to upgrade, so let's bump versions for the admin tails workstation.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nObserve the version of the cryptography package version\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe cryptography package version should be >= 2.3\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe cryptography package version is < 2.3\r\n\r\n[0] :

subrocesses to Paramiko SFTP, there's no point in listing `aes128-gcm@openssh.com` as the preferred cipher because Paramiko doesn't support it.  So we should probably change the default cipher to `aes128-ctr`.\r\n\r\nTo make ciphers configurable, we can do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npreferred_ciphers = \"aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr\" # This will be configurable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we can set the preferred ciphers on the transport before initiating the SFTP connection:\r\n```\r\ntransport.get_security_options().ciphers = tuple(preferred_ciphers.split(\",\"))\r\nsftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(transport)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following ciphers are supported by Paramiko:\r\n```\r\n('aes128-ctr', 'aes192-ctr', 'aes256-ctr', 'aes128-cbc', 'aes192-cbc', 'aes256-cbc', 'blowfish-cbc', '3des-cbc')\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mytardis/mydata/issues/204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mytardis/mydata/issues/204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/comments/650515909","html_url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/982#issuecomment-650515909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/982","id":650515909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDUxNTkwOQ==","user":{"login":"ibygrave","id":1485556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODU1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1485556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave","html_url":"https://github.com/ibygrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibygrave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-27T07:37:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T07:37:44Z","body":"This
