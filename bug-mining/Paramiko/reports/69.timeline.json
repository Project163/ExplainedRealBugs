My initial reaction was \"well those are probably just pinned Cryptography sub-dependencies\" but no, they are just _similar_. (eg `pyasn1` vs `asn1crypto`).

note: the original feature/request ticket for this is #584]\r\n\r\nThis pull request replaces pull request #1166.\r\n\r\nPreviously testing of GSSAPI (Kerberos) related functions required an\r\nexternally provided Kerberos environment. Therefore all GSSAPI tests were\r\nskipped.\r\n    \r\nNow the package k5test is used to setup a self-contained Kerberos environment.\r\nBecause k5test requires the new GSSAPI, this commit also merges\r\npull request #1166 and fixes broken GSSAPI test. If k5test is not available\r\n(i.e. on Windows), the tests still get skipped.\r\n    \r\nThe test case test_kex_gss.test_2_gsskex_and_auth_rekey is expected to fail. This needs to be resolved as a separate issue.\r\n\r\nThis pull request does not change the flow of control (except for the additional case in ssh_gss) and does not touch non-GSSAPI/SSPI related code. Therefore I recommend inclusion in 2.4. With this patch applied, GSSAPI could be tested by travis.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/1311/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/1311/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12623724304,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAHTOc4S0muyzwAAAALwbr8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paramiko/paramiko/issues/events/12623724304","actor":{"login":"fedordikarev","id":3909409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDk0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3909409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev","html_url":"https://github.com/fedordikarev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fedordikarev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d6f7d20727ab773dac0bfabed44899cae29da849","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fedordikarev/paramiko/commits/d6f7d20727ab773dac0bfabed44899cae29da849","created_at":"2024-04-26T13:13:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
