Can the page be updated to provide a proof of concept code on how to actually import the ssh_config?\r\n\r\nTo add on to my lack of understanding, I'm also not sure why the following code does not work since it appears my ssh_config is loaded. The only way to get into Host C is through Host B. The only way to get into Host B is through Host A. I am using ProxyJump.\r\n\r\nNon-working example:\r\n```\r\n>>> from fabric import Connection\r\n>>> c = Connection('HOST_C')\r\n>>> print(c)\r\n<Connection host=HOST_C gw=proxyjump>\r\n>>> print(c.ssh_config)\r\n{'serveraliveinterval': '60', 'tcpkeepalive': 'yes', 'stricthostkeychecking': 'no', 'forwardagent': 'yes', 'proxyjump': 'HOST_A,HOST_B', 'hostname': 'HOST_C'}\r\n>>> c.run('hostname')\r\nSecsh channel 0 open FAILED: open failed: Administratively prohibited\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"<decorator-gen-3>\", line 2, in run\r\n  File \"/Users/username/code/fabric/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fabric/connection.py\", line 29, in opens\r\n    self.open()\r\n  File \"/Users/username/code/fabric/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fabric/connection.py\", line 608, in open\r\n    kwargs[\"sock\"] = self.open_gateway()\r\n  File \"/Users/username/code/fabric/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fabric/connection.py\", line 640, in open_gateway\r\n    self.gateway.open()\r\n  File \"/Users/username/code/fabric/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fabric/connection.py\", line 608, in open\r\n    kwargs[\"sock\"] = self.open_gateway()\r\n  File \"/Users/username/code/fabric/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fabric/connection.py\", line 655, in open_gateway\r\n    src_addr=(\"\", 0),\r\n  File \"/Users/username/code/fabric/venv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/paramiko/transport.py\", line 944, in open_channel\r\n    raise e\r\nparamiko.ssh_exception.ChannelException: (1, 'Administratively prohibited')\r\n```\r\nWorking example:\r\n```\r\n>>> from fabric import Connection\r\n>>> d = Connection('HOST_C', gateway=Connection('HOST_B', gateway=Connection('HOST_A')))\r\n>>> print(d)\r\n<Connection host=HOST_C gw=proxyjump>\r\n>>> print(d.ssh_config)\r\n{'serveraliveinterval': '60', 'tcpkeepalive': 'yes', 'stricthostkeychecking': 'no', 'forwardagent': 'yes', 'proxyjump': 'HOST_A,HOST_B', 'hostname': 'HOST_C'}\r\n>>> d.run('hostname')\r\nHOST_C\r\n<Result cmd='hostname' exited=0>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn an unrelated note, as of python 3.7.1, I am receiving the following errors with Paramiko. The cryptography package is on version 2.5. Any insight on why this might be occurring?\r\n```\r\n/Users/username/code/virtenv3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/paramiko/ecdsakey.py:164: CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Support for unsafe construction of public numbers from encoded data will be removed in a future version.
