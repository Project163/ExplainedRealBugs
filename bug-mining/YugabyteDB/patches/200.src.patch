 In a CDC Stream, events from different transactions in different tablets across tables may appear at different times. This works well in use cases such as archiving, or with applications where only eventual consistency is required. There is another class of applications, where the end destination is another OLTP / operational database. These databases can have constraints (such as foreign keys) and strict transactional consistency requirements. In these cases, the stream of events cannot be applied as is, as events of the same transaction may appear out of order because transactions in YugabyteDB can span two tablets.
 
 The YugabyteDB source connector supports transaction ordering, which guarantees consistent streaming of records in the sorted order based on time. With transaction ordering enabled, the connector can be used to stream change events while honoring the constraints.
