+### Using the HYBRID_TIME LSN
+
+YugabyteDB currently supports two types of [LSN](../key-concepts/#lsn-type), SEQUENCE and HYBRID_TIME. In HYBRID_TIME mode, you can specify a hybrid time value `t` in the `pg_lsn` format and the replication stream will begin streaming transactions committed after `t`.
+
+To obtain the current hybrid time value, use the `yb_get_current_hybrid_time_lsn()` function:
+
+```sql
+SELECT * FROM yb_get_current_hybrid_time_lsn();
+```
+
+This gives an output in terms of a long value. You can further convert this to `pg_lsn` format by defining the following method:
+
+```sql
+CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_current_lsn_format()
+RETURNS text AS $$
+DECLARE
+    ht_lsn bigint;
+    formatted_lsn text;
+BEGIN
+    SELECT yb_get_current_hybrid_time_lsn() INTO ht_lsn;
+    SELECT UPPER(format('%s/%s', to_hex(ht_lsn >> 32), to_hex(ht_lsn & 4294967295)))
+    INTO formatted_lsn;
+    RETURN formatted_lsn;
+END;
+$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
+```
+
+Using the value from the method `get_current_lsn_format()`, you can now start your replication stream using:
+
+```sh
+START_REPLICATION SLOT rs LOGICAL 62D63025/5462E000;
+```
+
+{{< note title="Important" >}}
+
+The replication slot being used must be created with LSN type `HYBRID_TIME`.
+
+The `yb_get_current_hybrid_time_lsn()` function only works with LSN type `HYBRID_TIME`, and will not work with `SEQUENCE`.
+
+{{< /note >}}

 Only a superuser can execute the command to set the value of `yb_read_time`.

+#### LSN type
+
+A Log Sequence Number (LSN) in YugabyteDB differs from what you may be accustomed to in PostgreSQL. In PostgreSQL, an LSN represents a specific 'location' in the WAL, and has significance that spans databases and replication slots. In YugabyteDB, an LSN uniquely identifies a change event, and the LSN is valid only within the context of a specific replication slot. Due to these differences, there are inherent limitations in how LSNs can be used.
+
+You can specify the type of LSN to use when you create a replication slot. YugabyteDB currently supports the following types:
+
+* SEQUENCE - (Default) PostgreSQL-style LSN that is valid in the context of a slot. It is a monotonic increasing number that determines the record in global order within the context of a slot. It can't be compared across two different slots.
+* HYBRID_TIME - A hybrid time value which can be used natively with YugabyteDB. HYBRID_TIME is denoted by the HybridTime of the transaction commit record. All the records of the transaction that is streamed will have the same LSN as that of the commit record. You need to ensure that the changes of a transaction are applied in totality and the acknowledgement is sent only if the commit record of a transaction is processed.
+
 ### Publication
 
 A publication is a set of changes generated from a table or a group of tables, and might also be described as a change set or replication set. Each publication exists in only one database.
