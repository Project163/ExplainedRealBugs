Link: [DB-18830](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-18830)\r\n### Description\n\nBy mistake, the LogReader memory limit was applied to CDC as well as xCluster.\n\nThis was intended to only be turned on after more CDC changes (see [#28779: CDCSDK Add limit for log reader memory used by CDC](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/28779)).\n\nThe bad code is in ReadFromLogCacheForXRepl, where it always applies limit instead of using the obey_memory_limit parameter passed in.\n\n\n### Source connector version\n\nall\n\n### Connector configuration\n\n irrelevant\n\n### YugabyteDB version\n\n the mistake was backported  all the way to 2024.2\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive
