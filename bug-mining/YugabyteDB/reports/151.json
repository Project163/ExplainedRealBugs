Link: [DB-12879](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-12879)\r\n### Description\n\nThis is part of the new sequences replication feature.\r\n\r\nIn this task, we want to do the following when setting up sequences replication on the target universe:\r\n\r\n  * create the sequences_data table if it does not already exist\r\n  * connect to the corresponding stream for it from the source universe for each namespace we are replicating\r\n\r\nThis feature is part of xCluster replication and is only usable with DB-scoped replication.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/new-feature\n\n###
