This was in part due to the MetaCaches having stale information.  Until we fix that problem, a useful short-term mitigation may be to increase the amount of time we wait before retrying a failed replica.\r\n\r\nThe flag is:\r\n```\r\n~/code/yugabyte-db/src/yb/client/meta_cache.cc:100:\r\nDEFINE_UNKNOWN_int32(retry_failed_replica_ms, 60 * 1000,\r\n             \"Time in milliseconds to wait for before retrying a failed replica\");\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-9248]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-9248?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"SeanSong25","id":76596926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTk2OTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76596926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25","html_url":"https://github.com/SeanSong25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeanSong25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/20286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/20286/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
