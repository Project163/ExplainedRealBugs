Link: [DB-18413](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-18413)\r\n### Description\n\nThere is a ton of functionality in CatalogManagerBgTasks::RunOnceAsLeader, which makes it extremely hard to figure out what code is slowing things down when this function takes a long time.\n\nAs an example, we have a current QA test that causes this function to take 30 seconds for a as yet unknown reason.\n\nAdding a long operation tracker will make it possible to track down the cause more easily.\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain
