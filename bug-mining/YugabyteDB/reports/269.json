Link: [DB-15379](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-15379)\r\n### Description\n\nCurrently, when a universe is restored, including when DB clone or xCluster bootstrapping is used, its next OID counter gets reset.  This can cause problems with xCluster automatic mode's OID collision avoidance mechanism.\n\nThis task is to avoid these problems by on xCluster automatic mode replications start up, moving the OID counter above all already allocated OIDs.\n\nFlushing of the TServer OID caches will likely be necessary as well.\n\n(Here we are referring to the normal space OID counter; the resetting of the secondary space OID counter is not problematic.)\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/new-feature\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [x] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-15379]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-15379?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"mdbridge","id":15827795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODI3Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15827795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbridge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/26052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/26052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
