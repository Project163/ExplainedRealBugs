Link: [DB-9581](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-9581)\r\n### Description\n\nCurrently we cannot figure out from Prometheus how much memory a TServer or master is supposed to take (either it's hard or soft limit) because this depends on Google flags.\r\n\r\nFor example, by default a TServer is allowed to use the available RAM (there is a Prometheus metric for this) times the contents of the memory_limit_soft_percentage Google flag (currently defaults to 85%).\r\n\r\nMany universes run with nondefault values for this flag and in the future we are considering having the hard limit defaults depend on the available RAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need to know the hard and soft limits in order to make dashboard charts showing things like how close we are to the soft limit or what percentage TServer TCMalloc overhead is of the total TServer allocation.\r\n\r\nThis task is to provide the hard and soft limit information via Prometheus metrics so we can create such charts that work for universes using non-default values.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not
