Link: [DB-10288](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-10288)\r\n### Description\n\n**Request:**\r\n\r\nIntegrate automatic memory dump functionality into the product to facilitate debugging in various scenarios such as encountering Out of Memory (OOM) errors or nodes becoming unreachable. Currently, such scenarios are opaque, hindering effective debugging to QA.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n- Improved debugging capabilities during critical scenarios.\r\n- Enhanced understanding and resolution of issues.\r\n\r\n**Implementation discussed as per slack thread. Please view slack thread in JIRA:**\r\n\r\n- Develop a mechanism to automatically trigger memory dumps which could help in critical events such as OOM errors or node unreachability.\r\n- Implement throttling to limit the number of memory dumps generated and prevent log spew.\r\n- Integrate the functionality as a background task, so that if multiple places request memory dumps in the future, we can throttle them in one central place. That also avoids the foreground impact.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-10288]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-10288?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"SrivastavaAnubhav","id":17299377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjk5Mzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17299377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav","html_url":"https://github.com/SrivastavaAnubhav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/21396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/21396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
