Link: [DB-12407](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-12407)\r\n### Description\n\nAs part of supporting sequences for xCluster replication, we need bootstrapping to get the current information about sequences for the database being replicated across to the target universe.\r\n\r\nWe have investigated a number of possibilities, but the one we plan to go with is to put the information into the WAL on the source universe and use the normal xCluster replication to get it across to the target universe.\r\n\r\nThat is, we want there to be a recent WAL record for every relevant sequence containing its current state as of the records time.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to do the moral equivalent of the following on the source universe:\r\n```\r\nUPDATE next_val = next_val FROM sequences_data WHERE database_oid = XX;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe cannot actually use Postgres against this table, because it is a DocDB table not visible to Postgres.  Accordingly, we instead plan to:\r\n  * scan the sequences_data table to get the current information\r\n  * do one shot CAS operations (update to X if already X) based on that data for each of the sequences in question\r\n\r\nWe will not be retrying the CAS operations because if they fail there is already a usable record in the WAL.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/new-feature\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-12407]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-12407?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"yugabyte-ci","id":17281578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgxNTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17281578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/yugabyte-ci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/23493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/23493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
