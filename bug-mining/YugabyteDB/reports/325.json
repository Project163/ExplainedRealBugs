Link: [DB-18855](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-18855)\r\n### Description\n\nAfter LogReader was modified to report and limit its memory, the implementation of which uses TryConsume, a bug was discovered with TryConsume; because of the bug, user operations can be incorrectly blocked because the system believes it has less memory than it actually does.  (Very roughly, in the short term TryConsume increases the root memory tracker but Release does not decrease it again; this means very frequent temporary allocations can artificially push up the root tracker way beyond the actual memory in use.)\n\nFor details of the bug see [#29094: DocDB Root mem-tracker consumption overestimated](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/29094).\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [x] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-18855]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-18855?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"yugabyte-ci","id":17281578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgxNTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17281578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/yugabyte-ci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/29095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/29095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
