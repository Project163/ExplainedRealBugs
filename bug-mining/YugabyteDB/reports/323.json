In part this was because we only log operations as being slow that we expect might be slow; those operations tend to do a lot of complicated things like I/O, kernel calls, and memory allocation.  Unfortunately this means we can't tell from the fact that they are running slow what underlying resource is actually slowing us down.\r\n\r\nThis task is to instrument an operation that is fairly simple: running a task after a fixed amount of delay.  Hopefully messages about this being slow will be clearer in terms of what causes could be because no I/O or memory allocation is being done whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we have the following class:\r\n```\r\n~/code/yugabyte-db/src/yb/rpc/periodic.h:64:\r\nclass PeriodicTimer : public std::enable_shared_from_this<PeriodicTimer> {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe task here is to log when one of these timers take too long to start the associated task.  That is, if the timer determines the next time it should run the task is at T and it actually runs the task at T' where T'-T is too big then log.  Note that how long the task itself takes to run is not relevant for this instrumentation process.  We are just looking at how long it takes to schedule the task.\r\n\r\nHow long is too long is probably one second but maybe a gflag would be helpful.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of using the existing PeriodicTimer class rather than just creating a canary thread is that it will also give signal about when certain background tasks are not running in a timely manner.  For example, the heartbeat failure detector is implemented using this class.  To help with this, it might be helpful if every PeriodicTimer task had a name for use in the logging message.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-13902]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-13902?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"yugabyte-ci","id":17281578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgxNTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17281578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/yugabyte-ci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/24801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/24801/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
