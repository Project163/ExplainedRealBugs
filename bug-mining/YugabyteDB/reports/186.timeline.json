Manually delete one of the existing partitions (Let's say P1)\r\n    26. Run partition_gap_fill() and verify P1 is re-created and has data. Verify if\r\n        data is deleted\r\n    27. Refresh all the Materialized views and validate row count is the same as step 24.\r\n    28. Alter a few tables and rename the column- Verify the column name is also renamed\r\n        in partitioned tables (ALTER, Truncate, etc.)\r\n    29. Resume the DML ops threads and cron jobs.\r\n    30. Sleep for 10 minutes\r\n    31. Stop the DML ops threads and cron jobs.\r\n    32. Run drop_partition_time() and drop_partition_id() and verify the partitioned tables\r\n        are detached from the parent table.\r\n    33. Create a backup of some database (COPY FROM/TO COPY TO, ADD)\r\n    34. Drop those databases\r\n    35.

Link: [DB-14128](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-14128)\r\n### Description\n\nRelated to https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/24929\r\n\r\nWe send COW pointers to sys catalog write (`Mutate`) and expect the caller to hold the write lock. This is not enforced at build time there are cases where we will miss it and not catch it in any tests.\r\nA cleaner option is to pass the WriteLock to Mutate, and also make sure the lock holds a ref to the COW object itself.\r\nThis will require a big refactor of master code.\r\n\r\nDeletes do not require a lock today, which can also cause unexpected behavior. Once deleted the COW should prevent a write lock, but this mechanism does not exist today. See how to improve this as well.\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-14128]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-14128?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/24983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/24983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15353873075,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBlCVUc6enZ4vzwAAAAOTKYKz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/events/15353873075","actor":{"login":"ddhodge","id":79169168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTY5MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79169168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge","html_url":"https://github.com/ddhodge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddhodge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d2a53ed54ad11d7a9e9acf4fcddedef6619e65e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ddhodge/yugabyte-db/commits/d2a53ed54ad11d7a9e9acf4fcddedef6619e65e9","created_at":"2024-11-19T18:43:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15357054076,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBlCVUc6enZ4vzwAAAAOTWgx8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/events/15357054076","actor":{"login":"hari90","id":12418230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12418230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90","html_url":"https://github.com/hari90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fd0e350f86d118f2862a31e24ac101de9af6b40a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/commits/fd0e350f86d118f2862a31e24ac101de9af6b40a","created_at":"2024-11-20T00:15:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
