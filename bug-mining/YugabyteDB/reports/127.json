Although it is a PGSQL table, it is not known to Postgres so the backfill currently fails on it.\r\n\r\nThis task is to fix this.  No backfilling needs to be done for this table so a simple exit early on this table will suffice.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/new-feature\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-12217]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-12217?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"mdbridge","id":15827795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODI3Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15827795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge","html_url":"https://github.com/mdbridge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdbridge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/23296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/23296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
