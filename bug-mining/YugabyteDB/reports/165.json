Link: [DB-13548](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-13548)\r\n### Description\n\nThis is an endpoint that is supposed to be a prettier version of the load distribution view, using buttons instead of counts, but it only works for cases where you are using a single cloud and region and have have four or fewer TServers.\r\n\r\nIt was created in https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/8867 for demo purposes, but never got used in production or added to the public documentation.\r\n\r\nThere is a fair amount of code here and I have spent over two hours making this work correctly with split tablets, so it falls under my category of harmful dead code.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this task is to remove this endpoint and associated code used only by it.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any
