Today on the target we create the xCluster DDL replication extension before we change the replication role to target.  This causes it to be allocated in the wrong OID space.\n\nThis mistake can cause OID collisions if the source and up using one of the OIDs that the extension uses in the target.\n\nMore precisely, the current scenario on the target today is:\n  * run the output of ysql_dump from the target\n    * this creates the extension\n  * drop the extension\n  * re-create the extension\n  * change the replication role to target\n    * this changes which OID spaces used for new OIDs\n\nThere are multiple possible fixes here; for example, changing the replication role earlier or simply not dropping and re-creating the extension.\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [x] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-17544]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-17544?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"yugabyte-ci","id":17281578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgxNTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17281578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/yugabyte-ci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/27928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/27928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
