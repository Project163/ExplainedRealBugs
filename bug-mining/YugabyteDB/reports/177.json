Link: [DB-13927](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-13927)\r\n### Description\n\nThese routines have the code:\r\n```\r\n~/code/yugabyte-db/src/yb/master/master-path-handlers.cc:2113:\r\n    auto sorted_locations = TabletReplicaMapToSortedVector(*tablet->GetReplicaLocations());\r\n    auto l = tablet->LockForRead();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an error because the lifetime of the result returned by GetReplicaLocations is only as long as the shared_ptr is returned is held but the code above discards that shared_ptr immediately.\r\n\r\nThe shared_ptr needs to be held until we no longer need to use the locations.\r\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain
