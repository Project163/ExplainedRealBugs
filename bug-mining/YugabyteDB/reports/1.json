This causes the safe time lag to always be above 250ms. The reason for doing this is to reduce load on the producer and not unnecessarily resolving transactions very frequently. When there is no active transactions though we can more aggressively send the apply safe time.\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-8067]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-8067?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"hari90","id":12418230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12418230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90","html_url":"https://github.com/hari90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/19274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/19274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
