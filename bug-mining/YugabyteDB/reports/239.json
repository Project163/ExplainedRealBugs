DATABASE\r\n\r\nyugabyte=# select oid, datname from pg_database where datname = 'testdb';\r\n\r\noid   | datname\r\n------+---------\r\n19460 | testdb\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nyugabyte=# drop database testdb;\r\nDROP DATABASE\r\n\r\nyugabyte=# create database testdb oid = 19460;\r\n```\r\nExpected\r\nSucceeds, as the same steps do in vanilla PG15.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n```\r\nERROR: Keyspace with id '00004c04000030008000000000000000' already exists\r\n```\r\nWe're unable to use the OID, and the error message is unclear. (It comes from DocDB.)\r\n\r\nThere are at least 2 ways to fix this (thanks Yifan):\r\n1. Clean up the in-memory map when doing `DROP DATABASE`, making the namespace ID free to use for new databases.\r\n2. On the `CREATE DATABASE` path, if the state of the database in the map is `DELETED`, allow reuse of the namespace ID.\r\n\r\nSolution #1 is applicable to YBPG11 as well, because the namespace stays in the `:7000/namespaces page` with state DELETED. Solution #1 is cleaner for this reason.\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-8445]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-8445?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"hari90","id":12418230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12418230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90","html_url":"https://github.com/hari90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/19656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/19656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
