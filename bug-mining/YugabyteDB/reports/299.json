Link: [DB-17559](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-17559)\r\n### Description\n\nThis is the second part of [#27669: DocDB Fix OID counter(s) after importing system catalog snapshot](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/27669).\n\nWe are currently advancing only the normal space OID counter beyond the OIDs we need to preserve.  This suffices for backup/restore and clone because they don't use the reserved space and they create fresh databases without any hidden tables.\n\nThis can cause problems in corner cases.  This task is to extend this mechanism to:\n  * advance beyond the OIDs of hidden tables\n  * treat the reserved space OID counter the same as the normal space OID counter in terms of what it must advance past\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [x] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-17559]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-17559?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"yugabyte-ci","id":17281578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgxNTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17281578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci","html_url":"https://github.com/yugabyte-ci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yugabyte-ci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/27944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/27944/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
