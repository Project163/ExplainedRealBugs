Link: [DB-18328](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-18328)\r\n### Description\n\nMany of our metrics do not have the time unit in their HELP description.\n\nFor example,\n```\n# HELP cpu_utime Total user CPU time of the process\n# TYPE cpu_utime counter\ncpu_utime{exported_instance=\"ml-win-DIB1N:9000\",metric_type=\"server\",metric_id=\"yb.tabletserver\"} 21682 1726695073741\n```\n\nWhile the underlying metric definitions do have a unit, it is not outputted to the Prometheus metrics only the JSON ones.\n\nWe need the unit information to be in the HELP description.\n\nThis task is to fix this.\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [x] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive
