Link: [DB-17558](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-17558)\r\n### Description\n\nThis is the first part of [#27669: DocDB Fix OID counter(s) after importing system catalog snapshot](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/27669).\n\nHere we ensure that on during a restore or clone operation, the resulting databases have their normal space OID counter higher than any OID in use by a table.\n\nThis prevents problems where dropping a table with an OID higher than the counter can cause CREATE TABLE to fail later.\n\nSee the parent issue above for an example of this.\n\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [x] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive
