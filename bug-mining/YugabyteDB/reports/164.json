The new leader starts execution from the current time, and skips the current minute. This leads to missed cron execution for a maximum of 2 minutes. Any job with a schedule to run in those minutes are missed.\r\nEx: If we have a job with schedule `0 4 * * *` (Run at 4:00 every day), and the cron leader fails over at 3:59.10 am, then we will not execute the 4am job.\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-13277]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-13277?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"hari90","id":12418230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12418230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90","html_url":"https://github.com/hari90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/24365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/24365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
