Also before 2.20 the user had to set this flag to a high number when more than a dozen tablets were under replication. The scheduling fixes introduced in 2.20 eliminates the need for this change. Renaming the flag will help users who have set the old flag to a high number by reducing CPU and memory usage from the large number of unused threads.\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/enhancement\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-9271]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-9271?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"hari90","id":12418230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE4MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12418230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90","html_url":"https://github.com/hari90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hari90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/20305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/20305/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
