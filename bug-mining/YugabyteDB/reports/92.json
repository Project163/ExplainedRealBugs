Link: [DB-10187](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-10187)\r\n### Description\n\nCurrently PITR is allowing restore only upto the snapshot creation time of the oldest snapshot.\r\n\r\nIf PITR is enabled with a snapshot interval of 2min and a retention period of 6mins, theoretically it should be possible to restore to 2024-03-01 10:26:00 given the set of snapshots below. \r\n```\r\n\r\nSnapshot UUID                    \tState \t \tCreation Time\r\nd1659d21-2de7-4bab-8e77-186c46f7aca8 \tCOMPLETE \t2024-03-01 10:26:17.579703\r\n9a812e02-b20e-473a-8678-253bdf9262ba \tCOMPLETE \t2024-03-01 10:28:22.640780\r\n884ca49e-0adf-462a-8b56-62208737505d \tCOMPLETE \t2024-03-01 10:30:27.744028\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, during restoration code currently assumes that the oldest snapshot does not have any history and therefore fails the restore with the following error: \r\n\r\n```\r\nError running restore_snapshot_schedule: Illegal state (yb/master/master_snapshot_coordinator.cc:206): Trying to restore to { days: 19783 time: 10:26:00.526259 } which is earlier than the configured retention. Not allowed. Earliest snapshot that can be used is d1659d21-2de7-4bab-8e77-186c46f7aca8 and was taken at { days: 19783 time: 10:26:17.579703 }.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly the first ever snapshot after PITR is enabled might be missing history for 2 minutes, but every subsequent snapshot covers the interval between 2 consecutive snapshots and therefore restore to a time before the oldest snapshot creation time and most recently garbage collected snapshot should be possible.\n\n### Issue Type\n\nkind/bug\n\n### Warning: Please confirm that this issue does not contain any sensitive information\n\n- [X] I confirm this issue does not contain any sensitive information.\n\n[DB-10187]: https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-10187?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWRkNTljNzYxNjVmNDY3MDlhMDU5Y2ZhYzA5YTRkZjUiLCJwIjoiZ2l0aHViLWNvbS1KU1cifQ","closed_by":{"login":"SrivastavaAnubhav","id":17299377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjk5Mzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17299377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav","html_url":"https://github.com/SrivastavaAnubhav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SrivastavaAnubhav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/21269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/21269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
