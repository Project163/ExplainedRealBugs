Link: [DB-17767](https://yugabyte.atlassian.net/browse/DB-17767)\r\nFor #16551 we added to `TSTabletManager::AllowedHistoryCutoff` :\n```\n  auto xcluster_safe_time_result =\n      server_->GetXClusterContext().GetSafeTime(metadata->namespace_id());\n```\n\nThis however assumes that `metadata->namespace_id()` has been loaded by a previously called `TabletPeer::GetNamespaceId()`.\nThis is not guaranteed, and could lead to issues with not properly using the xcluster safe time for the history cutoff.\n\nEg, this is seen with `replicated_ddls` table for automatic mode replication, as it gets cleaned up by compactions despite being a part of an xcluster namespace.\n\n[DB-17767]:
