Please tell us how you really feel @michael-o  :-)\r\n\r\nI don't think comparison here is particularly apt: Java 8 has been around for a while and has really become the new baseline for anything not migrating to the new module world.\r\nBut beyond using new features there is also the question of tooling for Woodstox itself: it is not very easy to get access to JDK 6 and so in practice builds have already run on JDK 8 for years. So verifying actual usability from pre-Java-8 systems is difficult.\r\n\r\nBut I'll keep this in mind as -1 against upgrade; I will probably reach out on mailing lists too before making decisions here.\r\nPerhaps this would also suggest that actually major version should be increased to 7.0, if baseline is increased.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that previous 6.x version would remain JDK 6 and branch

There definitely is precedent for upping the Java version in a minor update e.g. commons-io, commons-compress, and common-lang all did so.\r\n> \r\n> Very weak argument. This is the same argument as getting a new mobile phone every two years just because your operator provides you a new almost one because you extend your contract for another two years.\r\n> \r\n> An upgrade makes sense if you are going to use those features.\r\n> \r\n> Regarding Commons: I consider this a dick move from my fellow Commons committers because those libraries are use EVERYWHERE and they should have stayed at 7 until next major.\r\n\r\nI'm not arguing that one should update for the sake of it, but the state of the Java ecosystem is important. If the other \"base\" dependencies are on Java 8, then any complex project must neccesarily also be on Java 8+. If the downsides are small, the upsides to justify an update only have to be relatively small.\r\n\r\nFor a start as @cowtowncoder points out the lack of tooling support in GitHub Pipelines introduces

It's extending the XML reader functionality with a new configuration option (default disabled) to support reading XML with unicode characters written using surrogate pair (UTF-16 encoding). This feature is very important to correctly read XML from the legacy services which produces responses this way and there is no way to change the behavior of them.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nThe external service produces a response with a unicode character written using UCS2:\r\n```\r\n<response>\r\n    <value>Merry Christmas &#55356;&#57221;</value>\r\n</response>\r\n```\r\nDefault behavior of XMLStreamReader is throwing an exception with message:\r\n```\r\nIllegal character entity: expansion character (code 0xd83c\r\n```\r\nAfter setting the `P_RESOLVE_ENTITY_SURROGATE_PAIRS` parameter to `true` it will be readed with no exception converting the surrogate pair entities to the appropriate unicode
