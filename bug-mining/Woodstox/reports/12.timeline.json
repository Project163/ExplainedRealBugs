And in case of `stax2-api`, there is also non-patch version bump. But it does look like an interoperability problem, regardless of classification.\r\nSo I would suggest updating `stax2-api` dependency to 4.0 and see if things work; the reason for major version bump there is just because JDK 6 is required over JDK 5.\r\nOtherwise API is backwards compatible, with relatively minor additions.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I could consider changing Woodstox to call deprecated method to improve inter-operability, with 5.1.1. Ability to work on earlier version would be a good thing, given that stax2 api itself has not significantly changed.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/comments/378332706/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/comments/414860902","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/46#issuecomment-414860902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/46","id":414860902,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDg2MDkwMg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-22T00:02:20Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T00:02:20Z","body":"Ahhh.
