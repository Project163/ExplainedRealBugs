This is backwards.\r\n\r\nThe attached sample [WS.java.txt](https://github.com/FasterXML/woodstox/files/638034/WS.java.txt) produces this output:\r\n\r\n> com.ctc.wstx.stax.WstxInputFactory\r\n> com.ctc.wstx.evt.WstxEventReader\r\n> com.ctc.wstx.evt.CompactStartElement org.codehaus.stax2.ri.evt.AttributeEventImpl c d false\r\n\r\nThe \"false\" in the last line is the isSpecified() return value for the sample XML, and it ought to be true.\r\n\r\nThere are actually a couple of problems with handling of the \"specified\" flag for attributes. The relevant AttributeEventImpl ctor looks like this, implying the last argument should be true for specified attributes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public AttributeEventImpl(Location loc, String localName, String uri, String prefix,\r\n                              String value, boolean wasSpecified)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, CompactStartElement#constructAttr() has this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public Attribute constructAttr(String[] raw, int rawIndex, boolean isDef)\r\n    {\r\n        return new AttributeEventImpl(mLocation, raw[rawIndex], raw[rawIndex+1],\r\n                                      raw[rawIndex+2], raw[rawIndex+3], isDef);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe argument name \"isDef\" suggests the flag should be true if the flag is default, but it's passing it unchanged to the ctor which expects a value that's true if the flag is _not_ default. Then, in #getAttributes() we have this:\r\n`                l.add(constructAttr(rawAttrs, i, (i >= defOffset)));\r\n`\r\nso it's passing a flag which is true if the attribute is default. However, in #getAttributeByName() we have this:\r\n`        return constructAttr(mRawAttrs, ix, !mAttrs.isDefault(ix));\r\n`\r\nSo it's passing a flag which is false if the attribute is default.\r\n\r\nWe originally found this with Woodstox 4.2.1. I can also reproduce it with 5.0.3.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
