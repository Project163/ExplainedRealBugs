Add a new factory method or methods in `W3CSchemaFactory` which could be called to read schema definition from some other intermediate form\r\n2. Serialize/re-parse `W3CSchema`, construct `InputSource`\r\n\r\nOf these, (2) feels sort of wrong (but looks like something similar was already done in \"loadSchemas()\"?) but could be done without changes to Woodstox. Adds more processing overhead.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to do (1) if we could figure out what such intermediate form could be.\r\nIf so, could release 6.2.0 (minor version upgrade since there's API addition).\r\nBut not quite sure what intermediate type could be used... would ideally be something in JDK 6 I think, although at this point in time I could consider requiring JDK8 as
