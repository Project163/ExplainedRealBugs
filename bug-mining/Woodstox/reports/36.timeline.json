(I've also tested it.) The value configured with this property is only read, when the \"forER\" (for Event Reader) flag is not set:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (forER) {\r\n    /* 30-Sep-2005, TSa: No point in returning runt segments for event readers\r\n     *   (due to event object overhead, less convenient); let's just force\r\n     *   returning of full length segments.\r\n     */\r\n    mShortestTextSegment = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\r\n} else {\r\n    mShortestTextSegment = cfg.getShortestReportedTextSegment();    <-- the configured value is only applied, if not an event reader\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was under the impression, that the \"forER\" branch above was introduced to fix some other, larger problem. That does not seem to be the case? I have changed the conditional and all tests seem to pass (except wstxtest.evt.TestEventReader#testEventReaderLongSegments, which explicitly tests this behaviour). Our own tests also pass with a thus modified BasicStreamReader, including the ones that test large text sections.\r\n\r\nSo if the \"forER\" branch is only a convenience as described in the comment, the necessary change would only be, to make the behaviour configurable. That seems to be quite straight forward. Should I prepare a pull request?\r\n\r\nRegarding the question how this would be configured:\r\n1) I assume a new property would be introduced similar to `PROP_MIN_TEXT_SEGMENT`.\r\n2) If an explicit setting of `xmlInputFactory.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.IS_COALESCING, false);` should be respected, I guess I could use the field `mConfigFlagMods` and a method similar to  `_hasExplicitConfigFlag(..)` to introduce a method that checks if coalescing was explicitly disabled. (Since the global default already means, that coalescing is disabled.)\r\n\r\nYou are probably the better judge, which of these options would be better. Both would work for us. (2) is probably more elegant, but has the bigger risk of surprising users with a change of existing behaviour. (If they already explicitly set coalescing to false and depend on full text segments nevertheless.)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you would be interested in a pull request, which version of configuration (1 or 2) you would prefer and optionally how a possible new configuration setting should be named.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/comments/1091899061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"johannesherr","id":7567298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjcyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7567298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr","html_url":"https://github.com/johannesherr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johannesherr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/comments/1092250103","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/142#issuecomment-1092250103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/142","id":1092250103,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVe4IM5BGmn3","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-07T22:00:03Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T22:00:03Z","body":"`forER` indicates \"for [when constructing] an EventReader\", to specify differences from `XMLStreamReader`.\r\nAnd the whole logic here was meant to cover a problem between Stax defaults and what (I think) users expect:\r\n\r\n1.
