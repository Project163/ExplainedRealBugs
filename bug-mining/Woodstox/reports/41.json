We have enabled XML Schema validation for JAXB by calling `Unmarshaller.setSchema()`. As Woodstox does not provide a `javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory`, JAXB automatically falls back to JDK's built-in Xerces for XML Schema validation.\r\n\r\nWe can indeed confirm that this setup works, XML messages are parsed and validated. Unfortunately, due to the error handling in `WstxSAXParser`, the helpful `SAXParseException` generated by Xerces during XML validation is not thrown, but instead jaxb-runtime throws an `AssertionError` in `UnmarshallingContext.endDocument()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-ri/blob/13402b7f1f19c840206936b56ad73e693eff2463/jaxb-ri/runtime/impl/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jaxb/runtime/v2/runtime/unmarshaller/UnmarshallingContext.java#L584-L585\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the relevant code in Woodstox, two things come to mind:\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/woodstox/blob/4a6d227e114edc9d46980497c1ed12bee3d3e59b/src/main/java/com/ctc/wstx/sax/WstxSAXParser.java#L624-L631\r\n\r\n1. the `SAXParseException` from schema validation is not handled in the `catch` (might be OK?)\r\n2. in `finally`, `endDocument()` is called, which leads to the `AssertionError` in `UnmarshallingContext.endDocument()`\r\n\r\nIf I understand JDK's JavaDoc correctly, it seems to be wrong to call `endDocument()` in case of an \"fatal error\", which may explain the diffferent behavior when using the Xerces SAX parser:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/b419e9517361ed9d28f8ab2f5beacf5adfe3db91/src/java.xml/share/classes/org/xml/sax/ContentHandler.java#L144-L151\r\n\r\nCould the `.endDocument()` call be moved away from the `finally` without breaking anything else?
