[documentation for XMLStreamReader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/stream/XMLStreamReader.html#getElementText--) suggests that `getElementText()` return all valid text between a `START_ELEMENT` and `END_ELEMENT`.  \n\nWith 5.0.1 and 5.0.2 woodstox, this doesn't happen for an element that contains text and then CDATA.  \nExample:\n`\"<tag>foo<![CDATA[bar]]></tag>\"`, calling `getElementText()` while at `tag` will return `\"foo\"`, while the example implementation from the doc comments suggests it should be `\"foobar\"`.\n\nI linked the documentation from Java 8, but it's the same blurb given for previous versions as well.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
