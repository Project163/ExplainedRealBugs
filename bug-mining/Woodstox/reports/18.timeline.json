Unfortunate timing, on one hand (since I just pushed 6.0.0 recently), but possibly fortunate since I think I went through similar problem with Jackson.\r\n\r\nSo: one assumption with current buffer recycling is that parser/generator instances are only ever used from a single thread: not just at any given time (i.e. single-threaded access), but during life-cycle of parser/generator instance. If so, `ThreadLocal` suffices.\r\nIn case of Jackson this was generally true, except that when async-parsing was implemented, usage pattern changed, and problem was found. Solution was to use atomic references in addition to `ThreadLocal`/`SoftReference`, and I think that should solve the issue (full fix will be in 2.10.0).\r\n\r\nI was actually wondering if I should port changes to Woodstox' recycler (which is where Jackson originally got it impl from), but since I had not heard of any issues I hadn't.\r\n\r\nBut sounds like there is now use case.\r\n\r\nNow: do you think it would be easy for you to test a fix, if I come up with what I think should work?

you know what sort of timeline you'd be looking at for publishing fixes to both woodstox and aalto? I'm currently looking into how to incorporate a temporary fork w/the ThreadLocals disabled into my project, but if you expect a pretty quick and easy fix to be available soon, I'd probably hold off on that.\r\nThanks","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/comments/530955774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jphelp32","id":2238383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2238383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32","html_url":"https://github.com/jphelp32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jphelp32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/comments/530977050","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/82#issuecomment-530977050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/82","id":530977050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMDk3NzA1MA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-12T19:44:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T19:44:47Z","body":"This
