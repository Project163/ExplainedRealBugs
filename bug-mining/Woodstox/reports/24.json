However, we've run into a problem in looking into upgrading to Woodstox 6.x, due to the MSV shading. We have a MSV BaseSchemaFactory implementation here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/cff773f4f750b7bdc3f955c1a5b1b5f4a311dd71/core/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/staxutils/validation/W3CMultiSchemaFactory.java\r\n\r\nThis won't work with Woodstox 6.x, as the Woodstox W3CSchema class now takes the shaded MSV XMLSchemaGrammar in the constructor. I can change all references to MSV to the shaded version. However then CXF won't work with older versions of Woodstox, which might be a problem in some projects that use both CXF and an older Woodstox version.\r\n\r\nIs there a way around this that doesn't involve completely porting W3CSchema and all associated dependencies to CXF to avoid uses the shaded package name?","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
