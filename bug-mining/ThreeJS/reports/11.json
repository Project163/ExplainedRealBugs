But, being a little clever boy, I set the pivot point (Lets just say `2,1,0`). In Lightwave when I tell to rotate from the pivot point, it moves as expected. \r\nBut when I use THREE to rotate the mesh, it rotates from `0,0,0` and not `2,1,0`.\r\n\r\nAnyone know how to make LWO respect the layer's Pivot Point?\n\n### Reproduction steps\n\n1.\r\n2.\r\n3.\r\n\n\n### Code\n\n```js\r\n// code goes here\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Live example\n\n* [jsfiddle-latest-release](https://jsfiddle.net/g3atw6k5/)\r\n* [jsfiddle-dev](https://jsfiddle.net/hjqw94c5/)\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\nr156\n\n### Device\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Mugen87","id":12612165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12612165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87","html_url":"https://github.com/Mugen87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
