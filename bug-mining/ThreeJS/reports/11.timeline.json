have fixed a similar issue in another loader by creating a custom 3D object class and implement pivot points there. In this way, you don't have to translate geometries but update the local/world matrices which is probably more what LWO expects. Maybe you can try to enhance `LOWLoader` like so:\r\n```js\r\nclass LWOMesh extends Mesh {\r\n\r\n\tconstructor() {\r\n\r\n\t\tsuper();\r\n\r\n\t\tthis.pivot = new Vector3();\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tupdateMatrix() {\r\n\r\n\t\tthis.matrix.compose( this.position, this.quaternion, this.scale );\r\n\r\n\t\tconst px = this.pivot.x;\r\n\t\tconst py = this.pivot.y;\r\n\t\tconst pz = this.pivot.z;\r\n\r\n\t\tconst te = this.matrix.elements;\r\n\r\n\t\tte[ 12 ] += px - te[ 0 ] * px - te[ 4 ] * py - te[ 8 ] * pz;\r\n\t\tte[ 13 ] += py - te[ 1 ] * px - te[ 5 ] * py - te[ 9 ] * pz;\r\n\t\tte[ 14 ] += pz - te[ 2 ] * px - te[ 6 ] * py - te[ 10 ] * pz;\r\n\r\n\t\tthis.matrixWorldNeedsUpdate = true;\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInstead of creating instances of `Mesh`, you use `LWOMesh` and apply the pivot point from the LWO data. Looking at the code, it seems `Points` and `LineSegments` require a similar custom class. \r\n\r\nWould be great if you could give this a shot and report back how is it going.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/comments/1974747929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Mugen87","id":12612165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12612165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87","html_url":"https://github.com/Mugen87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/comments/1974771350","html_url":"https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26733#issuecomment-1974771350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26733","id":1974771350,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAjKyc51tJ6W","user":{"login":"WORMSS","id":1384537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQ1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1384537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS","html_url":"https://github.com/WORMSS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-02T11:32:36Z","updated_at":"2024-03-02T11:32:36Z","body":"Not gonna lie, I totally forgot about coming back here.\r\n\r\nI've been using my hack for so long..

issue: #26733\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n\r\nfix: IFFParser.js now reads x as -x instead of z to -z. This now sets the geometry and pivot points in the correct location.\r\n\r\nIt seems the original comments in this file were correct, in stating switching the 'x', but the file was committed with the z being flipped instead.\r\n\r\nNow with the z being drawn in the correct direction, code like `lookAt` works correctly (which is +z based) and the pivot points no longer need double negating to have the geometry drawn in the correct location (except still had a -z problem)\r\n\r\nThis fix now means no dirty hacks need to be post-applied after loading of the model.\r\n\r\n[A playground using this

example shows both the minor fix from this PR, and also what exists in `r163`.\r\n\r\nI am not a massive fan of having to break things out into variables, but it was either that or \r\n```ts\r\nvar layer = {\r\n  number: this.reader.getUint16(),\r\n  flags: this.reader.getUint16(), // If the least significant bit of flags is set, the layer is hidden.\r\n  pivot: this.reader.getFloat32Array( 3 ).map(function (value, index) { return index === 0 ? -value : value; }), // Note: this seems to be superflous, as the geometry is translated when pivot is present\r\n  name: this.reader.getString(),\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand I thought this would get more complaints.\r\n\r\nI flipped the coordinates in webgl_loader_lwo.html file to match the removal of `-z` and addition of `-x`\r\nI generated a new screenshot because even though they look identical to the human eye (except the grid helper) it seems 0.7% difference was too much to pass.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/assets/1384537/d2d5e759-a520-4edf-a0c1-e9a26c41352d)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/28029/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/28029/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12301620416,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAjKyc5wpwJ7zwAAAALdO9TA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/events/12301620416","actor":{"login":"WORMSS","id":1384537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQ1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1384537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS","html_url":"https://github.com/WORMSS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WORMSS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"465219f892cf2492231881e6a0d2ec5416585716","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/WORMSS/three.js/commits/465219f892cf2492231881e6a0d2ec5416585716","created_at":"2024-03-30T20:05:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12321796212,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAjKyc5wpwJ7zwAAAALeb7B0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/events/12321796212","actor":{"login":"Mugen87","id":12612165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12612165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87","html_url":"https://github.com/Mugen87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"08fbd476f88cf14fd7871998eb2c80863f1a3f7c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/commits/08fbd476f88cf14fd7871998eb2c80863f1a3f7c","created_at":"2024-04-02T09:01:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
