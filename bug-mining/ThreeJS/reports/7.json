Import WebGL the way the docs described it\r\n2. Call isWebGLAvailable()\r\n3. Get the error in the console\r\n\n\n### Code\n\n```js\r\nimport {WebGL} from 'three/addons/capabilities/WebGL.js';\r\n\r\nif (WebGL.isWebGLAvailable()) {\r\n//...\r\n  } else {\r\n//...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Live example\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/webglcapabilitiesimport-ptln5o\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18304870/229493198-a0975e3f-426e-4609-8d3a-63027f6a734d.png)\r\n\n\n### Version\n\nr150\n\n### Device\n\nDesktop\n\n### Browser\n\nChrome\n\n### OS\n\nWindows","closed_by":{"login":"Mugen87","id":12612165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12612165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87","html_url":"https://github.com/Mugen87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/25760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/25760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
