In `RGBELoader` there is a computation `numElements = image_rgba_data.length / 4 * 3`. The `numElements` obtained this way is a total number of RGB items in the result. Still the iteration is done as:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnumElements = image_rgba_data.length / 4 * 3;\r\nconst floatArray = new Float32Array( numElements );\r\n\r\nfor ( let j = 0; j < numElements; j ++ ) {\r\n\r\n\tRGBEByteToRGBFloat( image_rgba_data, j * 4, floatArray, j * 3 );\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the target array is accessed with 3x times larger indices than expected and it should be:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor ( let j = 0; j < numElements / 3; j ++ ) {\r\n\r\n\tRGBEByteToRGBFloat( image_rgba_data, j * 4, floatArray, j * 3 );\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mrdoob","id":97088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob","html_url":"https://github.com/mrdoob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrdoob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/22388/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/22388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
