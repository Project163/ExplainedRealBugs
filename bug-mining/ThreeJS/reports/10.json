Create a  Vector3 CurvePath\r\n2. Call the closePath method\r\n3. Get points `curvePath.getPoints()`\r\n4. Look at the last two points\n\n### Code\n\n```ts\r\nconst curvePath  = new CurvePath<Vector3>();\r\ncurvePath.add(curve);\r\ncurvePath.closePath();\r\ncurvePath.getPoints();\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Live example\n\n* [jsfiddle-latest-release](https://jsfiddle.net/g3atw6k5/)\r\n* [jsfiddle-dev](https://jsfiddle.net/hjqw94c5/)\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Version\n\nr156\n\n### Device\n\n_No response_\n\n### Browser\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Mugen87","id":12612165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12612165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87","html_url":"https://github.com/Mugen87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mugen87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrdoob/three.js/issues/26849/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
