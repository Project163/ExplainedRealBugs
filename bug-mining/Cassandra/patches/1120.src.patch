-    - Hinted Handoff has two major improvements:
-        - Hint replay is much more efficient thanks to a change in the data model
-        - Hints are created for all replicas that do not ack a write.  (Formerly,

-      This means that running with read repair completely off is much more

-    - Hinted Handoff is substantially more robust, with the result that
-      when HH is enabled, repair only needs to be run if a node crashes.
-    - Because of this, read repair is disabled now by default on newly
-      created ColumnFamilies.
