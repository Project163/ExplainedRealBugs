+        An INSERT is used to write one or more columns to a record in a
+        Cassandra column family. No results are returned.
+
+        The first column name in the INSERT list must be the name of the
+        column family key. Also, there must be more than one column name
+        specified (Cassandra rows are not considered to exist with only
+        a key and no associated columns).
+
+        Unlike in SQL, the semantics of INSERT and UPDATE are identical.
+        In either case a record is created if none existed before, and
+        udpated when it does. For more information, see one of the
+        following:
