 A number of functions are provided to "convert" the native types into binary data (@blob@). For every @<native-type>@ @type@ supported by CQL3 (a notable exceptions is @blob@, for obvious reasons), the function @typeAsBlob@ takes a argument of type @type@ and return it as a @blob@.  Conversely, the function @blobAsType@ takes a 64-bit @blob@ argument and convert it to a @bigint@ value.  And so for instance, @bigintAsBlob(3)@ is @0x0000000000000003@ and @blobAsBigint(0x0000000000000003)@ is @3@.

+CQL3 distinguishes between built-in aggregates (so called 'native aggregates') and "user-defined aggregates":#udas.  CQL3 includes several native aggregates, described below:

+h3(#countFct). Count
+
+The @count@ function can be used to count the rows returned by a query. Example:

+bc(sample).
+SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plays;
+SELECT COUNT(1) FROM plays;
+
+It also can be used to count the non null value of a given column. Example:

+bc(sample).

+h3(#maxMinFcts). Max and Min
+
+The @max@ and @min@ functions can be used to compute the maximum and the minimum value returned by a query for a given column.
+
+bc(sample).
+SELECT MIN(players), MAX(players) FROM plays WHERE game = 'quake';

+h3(#sumFct). Sum
+
+The @sum@ function can be used to sum up all the values returned by a query for a given column.

+The @avg@ function can be used to compute the average of all the values returned by a query for a given column.

 h2(#udfs). User-Defined Functions
 
 User-defined functions allow execution of user-provided code in Cassandra. By default, Cassandra supports defining functions in _Java_ and _JavaScript_. Support for other JSR 223 compliant scripting languages (such as Python, Ruby, and Scala) can be added by adding a JAR to the classpath.
