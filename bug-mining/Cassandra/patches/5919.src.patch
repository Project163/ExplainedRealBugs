+    - The config properties for setting the streaming throughput `stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec` and
+      `inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec` were incorrectly interpreted as mebibits. This has
+      been fixed by CASSANDRA-17243, so the values for these properties will now indicate a throughput ~4.6% lower than
+      what was actually applied in previous versions. This also affects the setters and getters for these properties in
+      the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService` and the nodetool commands `set/getstreamthroughput`
+      and `set/getinterdcstreamthroughput`.
