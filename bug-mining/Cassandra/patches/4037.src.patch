 Upgrading
 ---------
+   - Clients must use the native protocol version 3 when upgrading from 2.2.X as
+     the native protocol version 4 is not compatible between 2.2.X and 3.Y. See
+     https://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg45381.html for details.

      representing the IP address of the client attempting authentication. It will be a breaking
      change for any custom implementations.
