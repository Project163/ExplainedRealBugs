+If the patch is for an older branch, and doesn't impact later branches (such as trunk), we still need to merge up.

    Notes on git flags:
    ``-3`` flag to am and apply will instruct git to perform a 3-way merge for you. If a conflict is detected, you can either resolve it manually or invoke git mergetool - for both am and apply.
 
-   ``-atomic`` flag to git push does the obvious thing: pushes all or nothing. Without the flag, the command is equivalent to running git push once per each branch. This is nifty in case a race condition happens - you won’t push half the branches, blocking other committers’ progress while you are resolving the issue.
