 The @compaction@ property must at least define the @'class'@ sub-option, that defines the compaction strategy class to use. The default supported class are @'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'@, @'LeveledCompactionStrategy'@ and @'DateTieredCompactionStrategy'@. Custom strategy can be provided by specifying the full class name as a "string constant":#constants. The rest of the sub-options depends on the chosen class.
