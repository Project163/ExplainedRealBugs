 The @compaction@ property must at least define the @'class'@ sub-option, that defines the compaction strategy class to use. The default supported class are @'SizeTieredCompactionStrategy'@ and @'LeveledCompactionStrategy'@. Custom strategy can be provided by specifying the full class name as a "string constant":#constants. The rest of the sub-options depends on the chosen class. The sub-options supported by the default classes are:
 
 |_. option                        |_. supported compaction strategy |_. default |_. description |
+| @enabled@                       | _all_                           | true      | A boolean denoting whether compaction should be enabled or not.|
 | @tombstone_threshold@           | _all_                           | 0.2       | A ratio such that if a sstable has more than this ratio of gcable tombstones over all contained columns, the sstable will be compacted (with no other sstables) for the purpose of purging those tombstones. |
 | @tombstone_compaction_interval@ | _all_                           | 1 day     | The minimum time to wait after an sstable creation time before considering it for "tombstone compaction", where "tombstone compaction" is the compaction triggered if the sstable has more gcable tombstones than @tombstone_threshold@. |
 | @min_sstable_size@              | SizeTieredCompactionStrategy    | 50MB      | The size tiered strategy groups SSTables to compact in buckets. A bucket groups SSTables that differs from less than 50% in size.  However, for small sizes, this would result in a bucketing that is too fine grained. @min_sstable_size@ defines a size threshold (in bytes) below which all SSTables belong to one unique bucket|
