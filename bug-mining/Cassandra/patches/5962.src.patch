 Picking the right compaction strategy for your workload will ensure the
 best performance for both querying and for compaction itself.

   The default compaction strategy. Useful as a fallback when other
   strategies don't fit the workload. Most useful for non pure time
   series workloads with spinning disks, or when the I/O from `LCS`
   is too high.

   Leveled Compaction Strategy (LCS) is optimized for read heavy
   workloads, or workloads with lots of updates and deletes. It is not a
   good choice for immutable time series data.
