 In order to replace a dead node, start cassandra with the JVM startup flag
 ``-Dcassandra.replace_address_first_boot=<dead_node_ip>``. Once this property is enabled the node starts in a hibernate
-state, during which all the other nodes will see this node to be down.

+(UN). Accurate replacement state can be found in ``nodetool netstats``.
 
-The replacing node will now start to bootstrap the data from the rest of the nodes in the cluster. The main difference
-between normal bootstrapping of a new node is that this new node will not accept any writes during this phase.
+The replacing node will now start to bootstrap the data from the rest of the nodes in the cluster. A replacing node will

-Once the bootstrapping is complete the node will be marked "UP", we rely on the hinted handoff's for making this node
-consistent (since we don't accept writes since the start of the bootstrap).
