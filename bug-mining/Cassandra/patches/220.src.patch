+                           The most straightforward check would be to check that all the seeds have been

+                           either all the live nodes are seeds, in which case non-seeds that come online

+
+                           or there is at least one non-seed node in the list, in which case eventually
+                           someone will gossip to it, and then do a gossip to a random seed from the
+                           gossipedToSeed check.
