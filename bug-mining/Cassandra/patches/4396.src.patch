-# This sets the amount of memtable flush writer threads.  These will

+# This sets the number of memtable flush writer threads per disk
+# as well as the total number of memtables that can be flushed concurrently.
+# These are generally a combination of compute and IO bound.
+#
+# Memtable flushing is more CPU efficient than memtable ingest and a single thread
+# can keep up with the ingest rate of a whole server on a single fast disk
+# until it temporarily becomes IO bound under contention typically with compaction.
+# At that point you need multiple flush threads. At some point in the future
+# it may become CPU bound all the time.

+# You can tell if flushing is falling behind using the MemtablePool.BlockedOnAllocation

+# to free memory.
+#
+# memtable_flush_writers defaults to two for a single data directory.
+# This means that two  memtables can be flushed concurrently to the single data directory.
+# If you have multiple data directories the default is one memtable flushing at a time
+# but the flush will use a thread per data directory so you will get two or more writers.
+#
+# Two is generally enough to flush on a fast disk [array] mounted as a single data directory.
+# Adding more flush writers will result in smaller more frequent flushes that introduce more
+# compaction overhead.

-# memtable_flush_writers defaults to one per data_file_directory.

+# and flush size and frequency. More is not better you just need enough flush writers
