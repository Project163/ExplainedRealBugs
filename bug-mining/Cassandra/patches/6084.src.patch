 4.2
+ * When doing a host replacement, -Dcassandra.broadcast_interval_ms is used to know when to check the ring but checks that the ring wasn't changed in -Dcassandra.ring_delay_ms, changes to ring delay should not depend on when we publish load stats (CASSANDRA-17776)
  * When bootstrap fails, CassandraRoleManager may attempt to do read queries that fail with "Cannot read from a bootstrapping node", and increments unavailables counters (CASSANDRA-17754)
  * Add guardrail to disallow DROP KEYSPACE commands (CASSANDRA-17767)
  * Remove ephemeral snapshot marker file and introduce a flag to SnapshotManifest (CASSANDRA-16911)
