 = Dynamic Data Masking
 
 Dynamic data masking (DDM) allows to obscure sensitive information while still allowing access to the masked columns.
-DDM doesn't change the stored data. Instead, it just presents the data on their obscured form during `SELECT` queries.
+DDM doesn't change the stored data. Instead, it just presents the data in its obscured form during `SELECT` queries.
 This aims to provide some degree of protection against accidental data exposure. However, it's important to know that
 anyone with direct access to the sstable files will be able to read the clear data.

 == Attaching masking functions to table columns
 
-The masking functions can be permanently attached to the columns of a table.
-In that case, `SELECT` queries will always return the column values in their masked form.
-The masking will be transparent for the users running `SELECT` queries,

 This is an optional feature that should be enabled with the `dynamic_data_masking_enabled` property in `cassandra.yaml`,
 since it's disabled by default.

 == Permissions
 
 The `UNMASK` permission allows users to retrieve the unmasked values of masked columns.
-The masks will only be applied to the results of a `SELECT` query if the user doesn't have the `UNMASK` permission.
-Ordinary users are created without the `UNMASK` permission, whereas superusers do have it.
