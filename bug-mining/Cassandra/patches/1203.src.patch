+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.

+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+

+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+            Commons Daemon Package
+               Version 1.0.7
+                Release Notes
+
+
+INTRODUCTION:
+
+Commons Daemon is a set of utilities and Java support classes for running
+Java applications as server processes.
+Commonly known as 'daemon' processes in Unix terminology (hence the name),
+on Windows they are called 'services'.
+
+This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
+Daemon package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  The
+current release adds new features and bug fixes, and is being done now to
+follow the release early/release often mentality.
+
+
+Compatibility with 1.0.3
+------------------------
+Binary compatible - Yes
+
+Source compatible - Yes
+
+Semantic compatible - Yes
+
+Commons DAEMON 1.0.3 requires a minimum of JDK 1.3

+* DAEMON-205: Add support for building on ARM processors (1.0.6)

+              signals and creating custom callbacks (1.0.6)
+* DAEMON-202: Allow JSVC_OPTS environment variable to be used in
+              the example Tomcat scripts (1.0.6)
+* DAEMON-180: Add DaemonWrapper to allow running standard applications
+              as daemons. (1.0.4)
+* DAEMON-179: Allow procrun to use java/lang/System as --ShutdownClass. (1.0.4)
+* DAEMON-178: Allow jsvc umask to be configured at build time
+* DAEMON-177: Allow fail during init with nicer message. (1.0.4)
+* DAEMON-176: Create config.nice during configure step. (1.0.4)
+* DAEMON-173: Allow --JavaHome=jdk and --JavaHome=jre options that
+              will guess default JavaHome from the registry. (1.0.4)
+* DAEMON-160: Remove obsolete code; rename native/nt as native/windows (1.0.4)
+* DAEMON-144: Drop sample dependency on Commons Collections ExtendedProperties (1.0.4)

+              found in the path. (1.0.3)
+
+* Add -wait and -stop parameters. (1.0.1).
+  The -wait parameter is experimental: that a is loop testing for a
+  file in /tmp and waiting n/10 seconds.
+
+* Allow to run as normal user for testing. (1.0.1).
+
+* Initial import to Commons, including the daemon Java API, and jsvc
+  for Unix and Windows NT/2K/XP, which allows running a Java program
+  as a native operating system daemon
+
+* Switch to JIRA bug tracking system.
