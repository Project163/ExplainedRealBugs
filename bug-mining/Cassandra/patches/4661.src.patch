 Upgrading
 ---------
-   - Nothing specific to this release, but please see previous versions upgrading section,
-     especially if you are upgrading from 2.2.
+   - In 2.1, the default for otc_coalescing_strategy was 'DISABLED'.
+     In 2.2 and 3.0, it was changed to 'TIMEHORIZON', but that value was shown
+     to be a performance regression. The default for 3.11.0 and newer has
+     been reverted to 'DISABLED'. Users upgrading to Cassandra 3.0 should
+     consider setting otc_coalescing_strategy to 'DISABLED'.
 
 3.0.11
