+        - caching: Enable/Disable caching for the column family.
+
+          There is 2 kind of caches: key cache and row cache. A column family
+          can be set to use no cache, only one of them or both.
+
+          A key cache hit saves 1 seek while a row cache hit avoids disk
+          completely (saving at least 2 seeks). However the row cache holds
+          entire rows and is thus much more space-intensive. Also, since full
+          rows are stored, row cache should be used only for column families
+          whose rows are small.
+
+          Note: the global memory size of both cache can be set in the
+          configuration file (yaml) or through JMX (though it isn't persisted
+          across restarts in that latter case).
+
+          Supported values are:
+            - ALL (Enable row cache and key Cache)
+            - KEYS_ONLY
+            - ROWS_ONLY
