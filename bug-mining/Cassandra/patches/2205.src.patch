 The @<where-clause>@ specifies which rows must be queried. It is composed of relations on the columns that are part of the @PRIMARY KEY@ and/or have a "secondary index":#createIndexStmt defined on them.
 
-Not all relations are allowed in a query. For instance, non-equal relations (where @IN@ is considered as an equal relation) on a partition key is only supported if the partitioner for the keyspace is an ordered one. Moreover, for a given partition key, the clustering keys induce an ordering of rows and relations on them is restricted to the relations that allow to select a *contiguous* (for the ordering) set of rows.

-When specifying relations, the @TOKEN@ function can be used on the @PARTITION KEY@ column to query. In that case, rows will be selected based on the token of their @PARTITION_KEY@ rather than on the value (note that the token of a key depends on the partitioner in use, and that in particular the RandomPartitioner won't yeld a meaningful order).

Note that the token of a key depends on the partitioner in use, and that in particular the RandomPartitioner won't yeld a meaningful order.

 * Updated the syntax for custom "secondary indexes":#createIndexStmt.
+* Non-equal condition on the partition key are now never supported, even for ordering partitioner as this was not correct (the order was *not* the one of the type of the partition key). Instead, the @token@ method should always be used for range queries on the partition key (see "WHERE clauses":#selectWhere).
