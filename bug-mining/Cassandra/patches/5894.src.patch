-# Coalescing Strategies #
-# Coalescing multiples messages turns out to significantly boost message processing throughput (think doubling or more).
-# On bare metal, the floor for packet processing throughput is high enough that many applications won't notice, but in
-# virtualized environments, the point at which an application can be bound by network packet processing can be
-# surprisingly low compared to the throughput of task processing that is possible inside a VM. It's not that bare metal
-# doesn't benefit from coalescing messages, it's that the number of packets a bare metal network interface can process
-# is sufficient for many applications such that no load starvation is experienced even without coalescing.
-# There are other benefits to coalescing network messages that are harder to isolate with a simple metric like messages
-# per second. By coalescing multiple tasks together, a network thread can process multiple messages for the cost of one
-# trip to read from a socket, and all the task submission work can be done at the same time reducing context switching
-# and increasing cache friendliness of network message processing.
-# See CASSANDRA-8692 for details.

-# for coalescing to be enabled.

-# Do not try to coalesce messages if we already got that many messages. This should be more than 2 and less than 128.

-
-# How many milliseconds to wait between two expiration runs on the backlog (queue) of the OutboundTcpConnection.
-# Expiration is done if messages are piling up in the backlog. Droppable messages are expired to free the memory
-# taken by expired messages. The interval should be between 0 and 1000, and in most installations the default value
-# will be appropriate. A smaller value could potentially expire messages slightly sooner at the expense of more CPU
-# time and queue contention while iterating the backlog of messages.
