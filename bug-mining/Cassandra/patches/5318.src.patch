+Upgrading
+---------
+    - Sstables for tables using with a frozen UDT written by C* 3.0 appear as corrupted.
+
+      Background: The serialization-header in the -Statistics.db sstable component contains the type information
+      of the table columns. C* 3.0 write incorrect type information for frozen UDTs by omitting the
+      "frozen" information. Non-frozen UDTs were introduced by CASSANDRA-7423 in C* 3.6. Since then, the missing
+      "frozen" information leads to deserialization issues that result in CorruptSSTableExceptions, potentially other
+      exceptions as well.
+
+      As a mitigation, the sstable serialization-headers are rewritten to contain the missing "frozen" information for
+      UDTs once, when an upgrade from C* 3.0 is detected. This migration does not touch snapshots or backups.
+
+      The sstablescrub tool now performs a check of the sstable serialization-header against the schema. A mismatch of
+      the types in the serialization-header and the schema will cause sstablescrub to error out and stop by default.
+      See the new `-e` option. `-e off` disables the new validation code. `-e fix` or `-e fix-only`, e.g.
+      `sstablescrub -e fix keyspace table`, will validate the serialization-header, rewrite the non-frozen UDTs
+      in the serialzation-header to frozen UDTs, if that matches the schema, and continue with scrub.
+      See `sstablescrub -h`.
+      (CASSANDRA-15035)
+	- repair_session_max_tree_depth setting has been added to cassandra.yaml to allow operators to reduce
+	  merkle tree size if repair is creating too much heap pressure. See CASSANDRA-14096 for details.
