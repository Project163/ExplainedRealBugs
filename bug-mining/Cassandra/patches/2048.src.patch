 1.2.3
  * Avoid allocating SSTableBoundedScanner during repair when the range does 
    not intersect the sstable (CASSANDRA-5249)
+ * Don't lowercase property map keys (this breaks NTS) (CASSANDRA-5292)
 Merged from 1.1:
  * nodetool: ability to repair specific range (CASSANDRA-5280)
  * Fix possible assertion triggered in SliceFromReadCommand (CASSANDRA-5284)

+---------
+    - CQL3 uses to be case-insensitive for property map key in ALTER and CREATE
+      statements. In other words:
+        CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = { 'CLASS' : 'SimpleStrategy',
+                                                  'REPLICATION_FACTOR' : '1' }
+      was allowed. However, this was not consistent with the fact that string
+      literal are case sensitive in every other places and more importantly this
+      break NetworkTopologyStrategy for which DC names are case sensitive. Those
+      property map key are now case sensitive. So the statement above should be
+      changed to:
+        CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy',
+                                                  'replication_factor' : '1' }
