-The @BATCH@ statement group multiple modification statements (insertions/updates and deletions) into a single statement. It mainly serves two purposes:

+The @BATCH@ statement group multiple modification statements (insertions/updates and deletions) into a single statement. It serves several purposes:
+# It saves network round-trips between the client and the server (and sometimes between the server coordinator and the replicas) when batching multiple updates.
+# All updates in a @BATCH@ belonging to a given partition key are performed in isolation.
+# By default, all operations in the batch are performed atomically.  See the notes on "@UNLOGGED@":#unloggedBatch for more details.
 Note however that the @BATCH@ statement only allows @UPDATE@, @INSERT@ and @DELETE@ statements and is _not_ a full analogue for SQL transactions.
 
+h4(#unloggedBatch). @UNLOGGED@
+
+By default, Cassandra uses a batch log to ensure all operations in a batch are applied atomically. (Note that the operations are still only isolated within a single partition.)
+
+There is a performance penalty for batch atomicity when a batch spans multiple partitions. If you do not want to incur this penalty, you can tell Cassandra to skip the batchlog with the @UNLOGGED@ option. If the @UNLOGGED@ option is used, operations are only atomic within a single partition.
+
+h4(#counterBatch). @COUNTER@
+
+Use the @COUNTER@ option for batched counter updates.  Unlike other updates in Cassandra, counter updates are not idempotent.
+
 h4(#batchOptions). @<option>@
 
 @BATCH@ supports both the @TIMESTAMP@ option, with similar semantic to the one described in the "@UPDATE@":#updateOptions statement (the timestamp applies to all the statement inside the batch). However, if used, @TIMESTAMP@ *must not* be used in the statements within the batch.
