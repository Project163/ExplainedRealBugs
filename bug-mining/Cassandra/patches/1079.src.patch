+# index_interval controls the sampling of entries from the primrary
+# row index in terms of space versus time.  The larger the interval,
+# the smaller and less effective the sampling will be.  In technicial
+# terms, the interval coresponds to the number of index entries that
+# are skipped between taking each sample.  All the sampled entries
+# must fit in memory.  Generally, a value between 128 and 512 here
+# coupled with a large key cache size on CFs results in the best trade
+# offs.  This value is not often changed, however if you have many
+# very small rows (many to an OS page), then increasing this will
+# often lower memory usage without a impact on performance.
