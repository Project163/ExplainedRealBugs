            <title>[CASSANDRA-20014] Discard hints based on write time, not timeout time</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-20014</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hints are created after a write timeout are created with the timeout time as the hint creation time. In the case of slow hint delivery, this can create a window of time where a write is applied after gcgs would have elapsed for tombstones written after the original write, and the tombstone has been purged, causing data resurrection. We should use the time the client request thread started working on the request as the hint creation time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="17896486" author="mbyrd" created="Thu, 7 Nov 2024 23:07:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;PR against trunk here:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3663&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/3663&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I&apos;ve also cherry-picked onto various similarly named, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0 branches on my fork, but assuming we&apos;ll want feedback on the trunk PR first, which can then be worked into those.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17896556" author="clohfink" created="Fri, 8 Nov 2024 04:00:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;+1 on the code but I think this can still happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the time that the tombstone purge occurs is based on the PartitionUpdates DeletionTime not the creation time of the mutation, so if theres a delta there (ie client side GC instead of coordinator GC) this can still happen? This would definitely help though. Guess I am wondering if Hint.expirationInMillis should be using writetime instead of creation time&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17896848" author="mbyrd" created="Sat, 9 Nov 2024 05:44:59 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;So just to elaborate a bit on an example of the particular case we&apos;re protecting against in the patch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. t=0, client1 -&amp;gt; co-ordinator1  write key1, then 2 of 3 replicas receive data, success response sent back to client&lt;br/&gt;
2. t=1, client1 -&amp;gt; co-ordinator1 delete key1, assume 3 of 3 replicas receive delete and persist it&lt;br/&gt;
3. t=2, on co-ordinator1 write to third replica times out, hint is submitted for replica3&lt;br/&gt;
4. hint delivery delayed for some reason (target down/instability/too many hints and cannot deliver fast enough)&lt;br/&gt;
5. t = 0 + gc_grace_seconds, compaction occurs on replica3 and tombstone is eligible as data has already been compacted into tombstone or involved in current compaction, data + tombstone both removed.&lt;br/&gt;
6. t = 0 + gc_grace_seconds + epsilon (&amp;lt;gc_grace_seconds+2), hint still eligible for delivery since TTL created with 2 second offset, hint arrives on replica3 and data is gone. (see related min of current/past gcgs/max hint ttl etc: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/hints/Hint.java#L133&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/hints/Hint.java#L133&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
7. t=later, tombstones + data removed on replica1, replica2 as eligible for collection and data now visible or re-appeared if read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing which is confusing you wrote something, you deleted it later, then much later it suddenly re-appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mitigation that a user can take is to ensure that CASSANDRA_MAX_HINT_TTL is suitably lower than gc_grace_seconds for any table where this poses a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the alternate problem you&apos;re describing, I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s an altogether different sequence of events?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the hint is happening on the write, not the delete, having a GC pause will only increase the time to get a response from the delete and the time that delete tombstone will live,&lt;br/&gt;
possibly shrinking the window and making the problem less likely.&lt;br/&gt;
With the existing code (prior to the fix) GC pauses before hint submission elongate the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cause a problem you want to send deletion time backwards as compared to the timestamp used for hint TTL.&lt;br/&gt;
It is possible to set deletion time (in addition to the cell timestamp for both the write an delete)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/fd4113d5fef09f6361bea88a35655db2ecb46427/doc/native_protocol_v5.spec#L572&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/fd4113d5fef09f6361bea88a35655db2ecb46427/doc/native_protocol_v5.spec#L572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So something like the following:&lt;br/&gt;
Assume gcgs of 60.&lt;br/&gt;
1. t = 100 write data with timestamp t = 50 to 2/3 replicas&lt;br/&gt;
2. t = 101 submit a hint to replica3 (could even be at t=100 with just the replica being down rather than on timeout)&lt;br/&gt;
3. t = 102 write delete at t = 51 with local deletion time set to t = 51&lt;br/&gt;
4. t = 111 tombstone/data collected&lt;br/&gt;
5  t = 120 hint delivered to replica3&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Would not be solved by the above patch.&lt;br/&gt;
The cell timestamp setting in addition may not even be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in the above example, the information we need to decide what to set the hint ttl timestamp to, is only available out of band after we&apos;ve hinted (the deletion time from subsequent delete)&lt;br/&gt;
So I&apos;m not sure there is an elegant general solution to this problem.&lt;br/&gt;
I suppose it may be mostly theoretical, since the spec does mention setting &quot;now_in_seconds&quot; is intended for testing purposes.&lt;br/&gt;
Introduced here:&lt;br/&gt;

                            <comment id="17896968" author="clohfink" created="Sat, 9 Nov 2024 21:57:53 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;My thought was also more along lines of 2 different coordinators&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T1: Client1 sends &lt;font color=&quot;#4c9aff&quot;&gt;A=1&lt;/font&gt;&#160;to Node1&lt;br/&gt;
T2: Client1 sends a &lt;font color=&quot;#de350b&quot;&gt;Tombstone&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;A&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; to Node2&lt;br/&gt;
T3: Node2&apos;s nowInSec = 101 in tombstone DeletionTime. &lt;font color=&quot;#de350b&quot;&gt;Tombstone&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;A&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;@101&lt;/font&gt; is saved (doesn&apos;t matter if replicas get it or not for this case)&lt;br/&gt;
T4: Node1 stores a hint at 105 for Node2 for &lt;font color=&quot;#4c9aff&quot;&gt;A=1@103&lt;/font&gt;, using its local time 103 (due to your patch, which reduces this from 105 to 103)&#160;&lt;br/&gt;
T5: gcgs+101 passes, and node2 purges &lt;font color=&quot;#de350b&quot;&gt;Tombstone&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;A&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;@101&lt;/font&gt;. This happens at Node1 local time gcgs+101&lt;br/&gt;
T6: Node1 sends &lt;font color=&quot;#4c9aff&quot;&gt;A=1@103&lt;/font&gt; hint to node2, which is problematic because it arrives after gcgs+103 and wasn&#8217;t TTL&#8217;d yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your patch definitely helps and decreases window and I am +1 on it. Just thinking that there still (maybe?) are cases HOWEVER, we don&apos;t really make linearizable guarantees so I think this is technically Ok? as its just the writes occurring out of order kinda. Weird thing is more that depending on nodes in query you would get different results.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17897303" author="mbyrd" created="Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:29:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m wondering with this latest problem you&apos;re proposing, what the timestamps of the write and tombstone would be?&lt;br/&gt;
Assuming this is all server side timestamps: If the clocks are out of sync so that the local deletion time is earlier than the&#160;initial mutation timestamp,&lt;br/&gt;
then the delete would presumably also have a lower cell timestamp and hence just immediately not be visible as the write would be seen as latest due to LWW?&lt;br/&gt;
I think that&apos;s also what you&apos;re alluding to with &quot;writes occurring out of order kinda&quot;, please correct me if I&apos;ve misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is this in a scenario where the client is supplying their own timestamps to try and ensure the delete is visible in a LWW sense, i.e they read the current write timestamp and increment it or supply both? (but not supplying a custom local deletion time)&lt;br/&gt;
I suppose that then comes back to the problem of the local deletion time being independent of the cell timestamps.&lt;br/&gt;
I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s a good idea if someone was setting custom timestamps, to then also set custom local deletion time via the now_in_seconds option, &lt;br/&gt;
but it does seem that doing so would also avoid the problem (assuming the patch was present).&lt;br/&gt;
I.e the local deletion on the later write would be shifted forward so the delete would last till hint delivery.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I&apos;m not sure there is an easy way to stop the problem if timestamps and deletion times can be set arbitrarily differently from each other, either via clock skew or users.&lt;br/&gt;
I did previously think about maybe adding just a configurable buffer to hint TTL, which could shorten the liveness by say a default of 1 minute.&lt;br/&gt;
This could also I suppose protect in the case that deletion time differs from timestamps due to some ideally bounded clock skew.&lt;br/&gt;
The tricky bit there is&#160;perhaps the trade-off between expiring hints more aggressively (maybe a problem if folks set a very short hint ttl for some reason?) and then having it be a large enough buffer to prevent the problem, maybe 10s or a minute or something could suffice?&lt;br/&gt;
It does add a fair bit of complexity/configuration for what is in all likelihood an even more obscure problem &lt;br/&gt;
(given the need for custom timestamps, long delayed hint delivery and&#160;precisely timed compaction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WDYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=bdeggleston&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;bdeggleston&quot;&gt;bdeggleston&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=clohfink&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;clohfink&quot;&gt;clohfink&lt;/a&gt;?     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also thanks for the feedback on the PR, I&apos;ve pushed some more changes which hopefully address them all.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17899599" author="bdeggleston" created="Tue, 19 Nov 2024 23:16:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Added feedback, do you also have ports for the other versions and/or test runs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding client timestamps, that&apos;s a footgun we can really guard against here. This should just prevent hints older than gcgs from being delivered&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17899913" author="mbyrd" created="Thu, 21 Nov 2024 01:37:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Added some more comments on the PR.&lt;br/&gt;
Yeah I have in progress ports, pre feedback, for other versions but no test runs, once I&apos;ve finished on the current PR/current feedback I can try and port the end result and get some test runs going. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17907512" author="mbyrd" created="Fri, 20 Dec 2024 23:15:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Here are the related branches for 4.0/4.1/5.0:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m also attaching 2 runs of CI for each branch.&lt;br/&gt;
This generally shows where a test that&apos;s flaky and fails in one run succeeds in the other. (skimming a lot of them also seem to fail sporadically on runs I&apos;ve done without the patch)&lt;br/&gt;
For a few of the Hint related tests that failed, I tried running them locally to repro the failure and couldn&apos;t.&lt;br/&gt;
I kept those ci runs in as they had the fewest other unrelated failures, to in turn keep the intersection of failures between two runs of a branch lower for manual inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
