            <title>[CASSANDRA-10674] Materialized View SSTable streaming/leaving status race on decommission</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-10674</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;On decommission of a node in a cluster with materialized views, it is possible for the decommissioning node to begin streaming sstables for an MV base table before the receiving node is aware of the leaving status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materialized view base/view replica pairing checks pending endpoints to handle the case when an sstable is received from a leaving node; without the leaving message, this check breaks and an exception is thrown. The streamed sstable is never applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logs from a decommissioning node and a node receiving such a stream are attached.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="14996546" author="tjake" created="Mon, 9 Nov 2015 13:48:55 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think the underlying issue here is streaming failures only account for problems during the file send.  Not any subsequent errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should handle this by first making this mv replica lookup error not throw an exception, but rather log a warning and force the data into the batchlog since on replay it will force data to all replicas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second and more importantly we should probably add an acknowledgement to the streaming operation that it was processed by the receiver correctly.  This could delay the decommissioning since for MV streaming that could take some time to process.  However it is safer esp in a low RF scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14996551" author="tjake" created="Mon, 9 Nov 2015 13:56:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=yukim&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;yukim&quot;&gt;yukim&lt;/a&gt; are there any tickets to address the latter already opened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, according to Joel this only happens when gossip doesn&apos;t fully propagate in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14996786" author="yukim" created="Mon, 9 Nov 2015 16:12:15 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;add an acknowledgement to the streaming operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;streaming can support call backs on success / failure of entire streaming session (in this case, decommission streams), if this is what you mean.&lt;br/&gt;
Right now, in decommission code, it doesn&apos;t seem to be using it though.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14996917" author="jkni" created="Mon, 9 Nov 2015 17:12:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, this doesn&apos;t quite support what we were thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to correct any of this, I&apos;m not particularly well-versed in streaming. As I understand it, presently, streaming works roughly like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Receiving node is receiving a file stream, can fail or retry.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Receiving node receives file. Receiving node sends received message.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Receiving node process received file. Receiving node sends a complete message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the materialized view path of applying a received file, we&apos;d like to be able to differentiate between the case of sending a complete message on successful processing of a received file and sending a retry/error message on failed processing of a received file (which is not presently possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a clean way to do this with current streaming behavior?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15027795" author="pauloricardomg" created="Wed, 25 Nov 2015 23:26:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=tjake&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;tjake&quot;&gt;tjake&lt;/a&gt; that the simplest thing to do here is to force the mutation into the local batchlog when the node is not a base replica of the mutation, and log a warning if there are no pending ranges (since they might be being calculated or still haven&apos;t propagated fully by gossip). I implemented a patch based on this approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&apos;table-wrap&apos;&gt;
&lt;table class=&apos;confluenceTable&apos;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jkni&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;jkni&quot;&gt;jkni&lt;/a&gt; could you verify the jepsen tests with this approach and check if the warning is being printed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second and more importantly we should probably add an acknowledgement to the streaming operation that it was processed by the receiver correctly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the stream receive task (and thus the stream sesssion) is only completed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.1/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/streaming/StreamReceiveTask.java#L175&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;2.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-2.2/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/streaming/StreamReceiveTask.java#L171&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;2.2&lt;/a&gt; after the files are processed (otherwise it just hangs), but on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.0/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/streaming/StreamReceiveTask.java#L231&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;3.0&lt;/a&gt; it&apos;s always completed even if there was a failure, what seems more critical. In any case, we should probably fail the stream session if there is a problem while processing the received data. I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-10774&quot; title=&quot;Fail stream session if receiver cannot process data&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-10774&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-10774&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and address that.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15033149" author="jkni" created="Tue, 1 Dec 2015 05:47:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The patch looks good for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one major question - in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/apache:19ff0e4...pauloricardomg:6a9be83#diff-71f06c193f5b5e270cf8ac695164f43aR720&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;mutateMV&lt;/a&gt;, before the patch, we only applied locally if the paired endpoint was the local endpoint, we had joined the cluster, and there were no pending endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This covered two scenarios - there was no view natural endpoint so we returned our own address, and the case where the base replica was also a view replica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new &lt;tt&gt;mutateMV&lt;/tt&gt;, pairedEndpoint.isPresent() in the conditional takes care of the first place but not the second while there are pendingEndpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be valid, but it would be a deviation in behavior from the original code. WDYT &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=pauloricardomg&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;pauloricardomg&quot;&gt;pauloricardomg&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minor nit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/compare/apache:19ff0e4...pauloricardomg:6a9be83#diff-71f06c193f5b5e270cf8ac695164f43aR714&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; should read &quot;its ring metadata yet&quot; as opposed to &quot;it&apos;s ring metadata yet&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15034022" author="pauloricardomg" created="Tue, 1 Dec 2015 16:38:25 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new &lt;tt&gt;mutateMV&lt;/tt&gt;, pairedEndpoint.isPresent() in the conditional takes care of the first place but not the second while there are pendingEndpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s right, good catch! I simplified but only thinking of the first case, but indeed the second scenario is valid as there may be a pending joining node which will be a natural endpoint for that view update. Update this and minor typo and re-submitted tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I don&apos;t get in the fist scenario though is that besides writing to the batchlog, the node is also persisting the mutation locally via the &lt;tt&gt;asyncWriteBatchedMutations&lt;/tt&gt; call, so the batchlog is cleaned if this call is successful afaik. If there are no natural view endpoints, shouldn&apos;t we write only to the batchlog and skip the local write via &lt;tt&gt;asyncWriteBatchedMutations&lt;/tt&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15034104" author="jkni" created="Tue, 1 Dec 2015 17:18:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I believe you are correct - in fact, I think if either 1) there are pending nodes or 2) there are no view natural endpoints, the current MV design will not want the batchlog cleaned up on a successful write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s worth asking Jake/Carl about intent in the original MV design.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15034458" author="pauloricardomg" created="Tue, 1 Dec 2015 19:47:29 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think if either 1) there are pending nodes or 2) there are no view natural endpoints, the current MV design will not want the batchlog cleaned up on a successful write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think when there is a defined natural endpoint and pending endpoints it&apos;s valid to clear the batchlog if the write is sucessful, because it means the data was replicated correctly to the pending endpoint that will own the range of the natural endpoint after the range movement is completed. Do you agree with that &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jkni&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;jkni&quot;&gt;jkni&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&apos;d like to understand better is why we write to the local batchlog when the local node is not a replica of the base mutation? Is it because the local node is probably a pending endpoint that will eventually become a base replica? In this case we probably shouldn&apos;t clear the batchlog after writing so the view will be replicated correctly to the natural endpoints once the local node becomes a base replica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=tjake&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;tjake&quot;&gt;tjake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=carlyeks&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;carlyeks&quot;&gt;carlyeks&lt;/a&gt; would you mind clarifying this?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15035931" author="carlyeks" created="Wed, 2 Dec 2015 15:09:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Originally, if the local node was not a replica of the base mutation, &lt;tt&gt;getViewNaturalEndpoints&lt;/tt&gt; would throw an exception, so much of this has been added because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jkni&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;jkni&quot;&gt;jkni&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Jepsen testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we aren&apos;t storing any values for the base table as part of the batch, replaying the view mutations once we are no longer a pending endpoint won&apos;t change the values that we are trying to push to the view replicas. For that reason, the batchlog that we write should be cleaned up once we have pushed the values out to the view replicas.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15036793" author="pauloricardomg" created="Wed, 2 Dec 2015 22:38:02 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, if the local node was not a replica of the base mutation, getViewNaturalEndpoints would throw an exception, so much of this has been added because of Joel Knighton&apos;s Jepsen testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this scenario happens (the local node is not a replica of the base mutation), I suppose we should we should skip the &lt;tt&gt;asyncWriteBatchedMutations&lt;/tt&gt; call and write only to the batchlog in the hope that this node will later be able to find a natural replica of that view?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, the batchlog that we write should be cleaned up once we have pushed the values out to the view replicas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got it. Regardless of pending endpoints, we should always clear the batch if we&apos;re able to write to the view replicas.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I agree that your latest comment is the right approach, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=pauloricardomg&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;pauloricardomg&quot;&gt;pauloricardomg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice, if possible, re-run the jepsen tests that motivated this non-paired endpoint scenario to see if they are still correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Jepsen tests look good so far - obviously, there&apos;s a bit of randomness in that, but I think this is good to commit.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
