            <title>[CASSANDRA-7511] Always flush on TRUNCATE</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-7511</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Commit log grows infinitely after CF truncate operation via cassandra-cli, regardless CF receives writes or not thereafter.&lt;br/&gt;
CF&apos;s could be non-CQL Standard and Super column type. Creation of snapshots after truncate is turned off.&lt;br/&gt;
Commit log may start grow promptly, may start grow later, on a few only or on all nodes at once.&lt;br/&gt;
Nothing special in the system log. No idea how to reproduce.&lt;br/&gt;
After rolling restart commit logs are cleared and back to normal. Just annoying to do rolling restart after each truncate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="14071663" author="benedict" created="Wed, 23 Jul 2014 12:39:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think this is fixed in 2.1 already, and am attaching a fix for 2.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be pretty easy to replicate this issue, actually - if you truncate a table with any data present in the memtable, the CL segment will retain dirty values for the records in the memtable. So, insert a few records, truncate, and then insert lots of data, enough to fill up the CL, and watch as it grows beyond the configured limit. Might be worth creating a dtest (don&apos;t actually need to monitor it going above the limit - if it goes above two segments is enough).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14071873" author="brandon.williams" created="Wed, 23 Jul 2014 15:36:43 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might be worth creating a dtest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems easy enough to do in a unit test, though, doesn&apos;t it?  I&apos;d prefer not adding to dtest run time where it&apos;s not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14072479" author="benedict" created="Wed, 23 Jul 2014 22:39:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Good point. I&apos;ve done this, and have another patch, however looking closely at the code I think we have generally got truncation a bit wrong, and it is still subtly broken. Especially with user-defined timestamps. We take the current server time in millis and drop any tables with data that is strictly older than this. We could (and, I think, should) use the ReplayPosition we store against each sstable. Unfortunately this might break custom 2is, but for those we can stick to sys-time for now, since that&apos;s what they&apos;ve been making do with, and we can fix it there as well for 2.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also not clear to me on reading this why we nuke the memtables without flushing, since we seem intent on snapshotting the data (and in fact flush it twice). This bug affects the case where we do not snapshot, however in the case that we do surely we want all mutations in the memtables to hit disk prior to snapshotting, else the snapshot won&apos;t contain the records (or, alternatively, we don&apos;t care about flushing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the data at all)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=brandon.williams&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;brandon.williams&quot;&gt;brandon.williams&lt;/a&gt; wdyt?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6905&quot; title=&quot;commitlog archive replay should attempt to replay all mutations&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-6905&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-6905&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sounds related, though apparently back then we didn&apos;t do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;we nuke the memtables without flushing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That does seem wrong to me.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14073169" author="benedict" created="Thu, 24 Jul 2014 13:00:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attaching an updated patch for 2.0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2.1, I would like to modify the behaviour of truncate, and have it rely explicitly on ReplayPosition since this is considerably safer. However whilst more correct it has its own challenges, as we do not have an easy way to find the ReplayPosition relating to a hint/batchlog entry, but we &lt;b&gt;could&lt;/b&gt; serialize these alongside, which is the most correct thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14078309" author="benedict" created="Tue, 29 Jul 2014 20:32:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this a little more, it&apos;s likely a variant of this, related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5911&quot; title=&quot;Commit logs are not removed after nodetool flush or nodetool drain&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-5911&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-5911&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will affect DROP also. We probably need to fix this in 2.0 after all.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14079176" author="JIRAUSER308715" created="Wed, 30 Jul 2014 11:02:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Sounds like fixing DROP is more involved.  I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-7646&quot; title=&quot;DROP may not clean commit log segments when auto snapshot is false&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-7646&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-7646&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to track that.  I think we should get the truncate fix out as I would guess more people do truncates repeatedly than drops.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14079357" author="JIRAUSER308715" created="Wed, 30 Jul 2014 15:13:54 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Why don&apos;t we just remove the &quot;if&quot; here and always flush before truncate?  The flush isn&apos;t what causes the snapshot, so we aren&apos;t violating that if we flush either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;        if (DatabaseDescriptor.isAutoSnapshot())
        {
            // flush the CF being truncated before forcing the new segment
            forceBlockingFlush();

            // sleep a little to make sure that our truncatedAt comes after any sstable
            // that was part of the flushed we forced; otherwise on a tie, it won&apos;t get deleted.
            Uninterruptibles.sleepUninterruptibly(1, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        }

I think it is a less invasive change to a stable branch, considering auto snapshot=false is a very rare case, so its better to just not special case it in places we don&apos;t need to.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="14079460" author="tjake" created="Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:28:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jjordan&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;jjordan&quot;&gt;jjordan&lt;/a&gt; here since truncate is not a common operation, who cares if it needs to flush?  Truncate requires a compaction step to move the data out of the way anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14079463" author="benedict" created="Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:30:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Well, the special casing you want to eliminate actually had nothing to do with if it was broken or not. It&apos;s the second special case that creates a snapshot that &lt;em&gt;avoided&lt;/em&gt; breaking it for the &apos;special&apos; case of snapshots being enabled, and we cannot avoid different behaviour there. However if we wanted to always flush we could simplify the code slightly.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14079470" author="benedict" created="Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:34:19 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truncate requires a compaction step to move the data out of the way anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think it does. It just deletes the files immediately through releasing the reference.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I like just removing the code causing the problem, rather than trying to do the fancy stuff keeping track of what we dropped and manually fixing segments.  Seems simpler and less error prone to me.  Flush, wait 1 millisecond, unlink all the sstables.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14079532" author="benedict" created="Wed, 30 Jul 2014 17:05:39 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t have a super-strong preference. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; considerably faster this way, but I don&apos;t really mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;What does bug me at the moment is that truncate is completely broken for user-provided timestamps. I think we should have a warning somewhere about it. Hinted handoff and batchlog replay will potentially break badly after a truncate.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scratch that. Was remembering a maybe-problem I realised probably wasn&apos;t a problem. Should stop corresponding when not working...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I don&apos;t mind which solution we go for in 2.1; always flush, or grab the last replay position from the memtable (either are pretty trivial)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Originally this was added for 1.1: &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4153&quot; title=&quot;Optimize truncate when snapshots are disabled or keyspace not durable&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-4153&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-4153&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
And with 1.2 there was another tweak on this topic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5704&quot; title=&quot;add cassandra.unsafesystem property (Truncate flushes to disk again in 1.2, even with durable_writes=false)&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-5704&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-5704&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please reconsider this patch, as it will slow down truncates and will probably make automated testing impossible again (as truncate becomes so slow it will be unusable)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Edit: could the patch being changed so that renew is only used only when durable_writes if off? Shouldnt that solve the growing commitlog issue?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
