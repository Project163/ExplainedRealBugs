            <title>[CASSANDRA-4573] HSHA doesn&apos;t handle large messages gracefully</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4573</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;HSHA doesn&apos;t seem to enforce any kind of max message length, and when messages are too large, it doesn&apos;t fail gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With debug logs enabled, you&apos;ll see this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;DEBUG 13:13:31,805 Unexpected state 16&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which seems to mean that there&apos;s a SelectionKey that&apos;s valid, but isn&apos;t ready for reading, writing, or accepting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Client-side, you&apos;ll get this thrift error (while trying to read a frame as part of &lt;tt&gt;recv_batch_mutate&lt;/tt&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;TTransportException: TSocket read 0 bytes&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&apos;m testing against 1.1.4, with the only change to cassandra.yaml being a switch to hsha.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;With debug logs enabled, you&apos;ll see this:&lt;br/&gt;
DEBUG 13:13:31,805 Unexpected state 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected state 16 means the intrest operation is accept. &lt;br/&gt;
If you look at the code it is a while loop (the intrestOps can change between the if conditions) and will be handled in the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSHA doesn&apos;t seem to enforce any kind of max message length&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neither does sync &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; i can reproduce this error both in Sync and hsha, still trying to see where the timeout comes from though.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;sync does enforce frame size&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Run: tail -f /var/log/cassandra/system.log |grep GCInspector&lt;br/&gt;
Enable GC logging.&lt;br/&gt;
Run: python repro.py&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would see timeout when you see &quot;threads were stopped:&quot; to be &amp;gt; 1.5 Seconds or so.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;The client-side socket timeout is set to 3 seconds, so it&apos;s not hitting that timeout due to garbage collections.  I should also note that the client-side error is different when there is a client socket timeout (something like &lt;tt&gt;TTransportException: timed out reading 4 bytes&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;The Timeout happens both in Sync and HSHA servers (randomly and i am not able to reproduce both cases reliably) and the only thing which i can notice is that the client (pycassa) runs 100% CPU most of the time... other than that everything else looks normal.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13714355" author="peter-librato" created="Sat, 20 Jul 2013 06:42:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We may be seeing this behavior in 1.2.6. I haven&apos;t enabled debug but we are definitely seeing a correlation between groups of &apos;Read an invalid frame size of 0&apos; messages (dozens at a time) during the same second that we&apos;re seeing &quot;large&quot; (10 seconds or more) &apos;GC for ConcurrentMarkSweep&apos; events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a 9 node cluster we see this anywhere from 1 to 9 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyler, is this ticket still valid?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;The changes for &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5582&quot; title=&quot;Replace CustomHsHaServer with better optimized solution based on LMAX Disruptor&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-5582&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-5582&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; probably make this invalid for 2.0, which I&apos;m fine with.  I&apos;ll assign to myself, test against 2.0, close this ticket and open a new one for the 2.0 implementation if needed.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

This would detect frame size violation right when it&apos;s read from the socket and report an error as well as close connection.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

There&apos;s one problem with the patch: you changed the cassandra.yaml default to &lt;tt&gt;hsha&lt;/tt&gt;; other than that, +1.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
