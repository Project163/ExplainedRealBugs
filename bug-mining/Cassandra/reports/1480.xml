                            <comment id="13203424" author="amorton" created="Wed, 8 Feb 2012 09:44:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve done some digging and this is what I think is happening...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StorageProxy.counterWriteOnCoordinatorPerformer() creates a counterWriteTask and put it in the local MUTATION TP. This will run the mutation and then put a task in REPLICATE_ON_WRITE to send if the counter write to other nodes, if a node is down hints a scheduled and AbstractWriteResponseHandler.addFutureForHint() is called with the hint mutation future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the response handler was originally created in the request thread, which may now have called get() to wait on it. This may miss hints that have not already been added or may get the CME in the error here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like this is only a problem for counter writes where the coordinator is a replica, and then only in certain circumstances. Counters where another replica is the leader look ok and so do regular writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the AWRH.hintFutures to a CopyOnWriteArrayList (to be cautious) and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change AWRH.get() to wait on hints after the normal request has complet instead of before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll try to pick it up again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

So needs additional coordination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should be able to find some time today to keep working on this.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13210153" author="slebresne" created="Fri, 17 Feb 2012 09:11:16 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think you&apos;re right on the reasons that causes the exception, and that our fix would avoid that exception. There is however two problems/annoying things (not really related to the patch per se):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;this break the current property that counter writes at CL.ONE don&apos;t have to wait on the read. In other words, that would increase the latency of CL.ONE counter writes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;this completely break counters when replicate_on_write == false. This may not be a problem anymore on 1.1 if we remove that option (&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3868&quot; title=&quot;Remove or nullify replicate_on_write option&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-3868&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-3868&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) but breaking it in 1.0 (on a minor release) is more problematic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A &quot;solution&quot; to prevent those two problems would be to add a way to specify that we don&apos;t want to wait on hints being locally written and use that for counter at CL.ONE, but that means we would skip the current property of &apos;when a write returns, we guarantee that all hint for nodes that are &lt;b&gt;known&lt;/b&gt; dead have been written locally&apos;. Which leads me to a question: what does that latter property really give us?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Fixed problem where StorageProxy.mutateCounter() would not call handler.finalizeHints() if &lt;br/&gt;
it was not a replica for the row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved timeout when waiting for hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;this break the current property that counter writes at CL.ONE don&apos;t have to wait on the read. In other words, that would increase the latency of CL.ONE counter writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added IWriteResponseHanlder.dontBlockOnHints() called from StorageProxy.counterWriteTask() if CL is ONE. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;this completely break counters when replicate_on_write == false. This may not be a problem anymore on 1.1 if we remove that option (&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3868&quot; title=&quot;Remove or nullify replicate_on_write option&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-3868&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-3868&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) but breaking it in 1.0 (on a minor release) is more problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure what you mean. In StoragrProxy.counterWriteTask() if not cm.shouldReplicateOnWrite() i finalize the hints with the handler. So that get() will not wait for more futures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;guarantee that all hint for nodes that are known dead have been written locally&apos;. Which leads me to a question: what does that latter property really give us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It slows down the client and reduces the chance that a node can get overwhelmed if it has to store a lot of hints. But at CL ONE the client is asking the server to do the minimal amount of work before returning so it makes sense.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13212604" author="slebresne" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2012 14:12:32 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;if not cm.shouldReplicateOnWrite() i finalize the hints with the handler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry I missed that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it slows down the client and reduces the chance that a node can get overwhelmed if it has to store a lot of hints&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think that is the goal of that code. We already have code for that (make sure a node don&apos;t get overwhelm writing hints locally) in sendToHintedEndpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reasonable intent of that code (the code that makes writes wait that hint are locally written) that I can see would be to ensure that when we acknowledge the client we can guarantee that hints for dead nodes are stored (and thus will eventually get delivered). However, this only works for known dead nodes, so we cannot really make that guarantee (unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not saying the attached patch won&apos;t work, but it does help making the write path more complicated and &apos;messy&apos; that I&apos;d like it to be. Typically having to not forget to call finalizeHints() is a bit error-prone, etc...  So I&apos;m wondering, do we really have a strong reason for waiting for hints during writes in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the patch though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We should raise a timeout exception if waiting for the hints to be finalized timeouts inserting of throwing an assertion error. It is possible (at least in theory) for that to timeout.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not sure I understand dontBlockOnHints(). It seems to only skip the fact that we signal hintsFinalized. I think we should just call finalizeHints() when we don&apos;t want to block on hints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you&apos;re right. Originally we had &quot;wait for hint delivery before ack&quot; as an attempt to prevent overload and OOM, but then we added the more fine-grained checks in sTHE instead.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13212793" author="slebresne" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2012 18:43:34 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attaching a version that take the approch of removing the &apos;wait on hints future&apos; from the write path. Again the rational is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Since that code was added, we&apos;ve introduced a better way to deal with node being overwhelm by hints in sTHE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Since we&apos;ll have hint future only for node that are known dead, waiting on only those doesn&apos;t really give any special new guarantee to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                            <comment id="13212838" author="amorton" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2012 19:41:12 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think that is the goal of that code. We already have code for that (make sure a node don&apos;t get overwhelm writing hints locally) in sendToHintedEndpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missed the totalHintsInProgress check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&apos;m wondering, do we really have a strong reason for waiting for hints during writes in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMHO no, other than CL ANY. I know it&apos;s different in 1.0 but HH provides weak guarantees. Recording a hint locally does not guarantee that it will be applied to the endpoint before the next read for the row. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not saying the attached patch won&apos;t work, but it does help making the write path more complicated and &apos;messy&apos; that I&apos;d like it to be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we stick with waiting for hints I could change it to &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; wait for acknowledgement that all hint futures collected by default. Counter mutations on the coordinator are the exception, they can tell the handler to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should raise a timeout exception if waiting for the hints to be finalized timeouts inserting of throwing an assertion error. It is possible (at least in theory) for that to timeout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure I understand dontBlockOnHints(). It seems to only skip the fact that we signal hintsFinalized. I think we should just call finalizeHints() when we don&apos;t want to block on hints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finalizeHints() stops modifications to the hints collection, so calling addFutureForHint() after it will raise an exception. dontBlockOnHints() tells get() to ignore the hints collection and prevents finalizeHints() from stopping modification to the hints collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is to support sendToHintedEndpoints passing hint futures to the handler when using CL ONE. I wanted calls to addFutureForHint() to always work unless finalizeHints() had been called.    &lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13212898" author="amorton" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2012 20:40:28 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 for your patch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not in your patch but if sendToHintedEndpoints() throws a TimeoutException because too many inflight hints when performing a counter write on a leader that is not the coordinator. CounterMutationVerbHandler will swallow the exception and wait for the coordinator to time out.  Would it be better to use a different exception and return to the coordinator ? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13213456" author="slebresne" created="Wed, 22 Feb 2012 08:32:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Committed, thanks&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be better to use a different exception and return to the coordinator ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that the leader is using a WriteHandler to wait on the response of the coordinator, which in its current form doesn&apos;t have any kind of failure mode (A WriteResponse does have a boolean to indicate success but no code use it ever). So basically it would be possible but would add much complication when just waiting on the coordinator to timeout is probably good enough.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
