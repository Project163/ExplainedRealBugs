            <title>[CASSANDRA-4436] Counters in columns don&apos;t preserve correct values after cluster restart</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4436</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Similar to #3821. but affecting normal columns. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Set up a 2-node cluster with rf=2.&lt;br/&gt;
1. Create a counter column family and increment a 100 keys in loop 5000 times. &lt;br/&gt;
2. Then make a rolling restart to cluster. &lt;br/&gt;
3. Again increment another 5000 times.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Make a rolling restart to cluster.&lt;br/&gt;
5. Again increment another 5000 times.&lt;br/&gt;
6. Make a rolling restart to cluster.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After step 6 we were able to reproduce bug with bad counter values. &lt;br/&gt;
Expected values were 15 000. Values returned from cluster are higher then 15000 + some random number.&lt;br/&gt;
Rolling restarts are done with nodetool drain. Always waiting until second node discover its down then kill java process. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I tried reproducing with those exact steps (as far as I can tell) a few times on both 1.0 and 1.1 (the counter code didn&apos;t change much between 1.0 and 1.1) and wasn&apos;t able to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In version 1.0.10 am always able to reproduce with this steps.. but its not reproducible in 1.1.2 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I stop writing and shutdown node with &quot;nodetool drain&quot; there are some small commitlog files, but I don&apos;t bother to delete them just restart cassandra process. Maybe this is case ?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13416080" author="slebresne" created="Tue, 17 Jul 2012 10:58:32 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The only difference I could see with the test I ran previously was the use of compression. So while I strongly doubt compression can have anything to do with that in any way, I rerun the test against 1.0 a bunch of time but I was still not able to reproduce any error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you seem to be able to reproduce easily, would you mind sharing the scripts you use to reproduce? I.e. mainly the code you use for insertion, preferably in plain thrift or CQL2 as this would eliminate the possibility of a client library bug.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13416298" author="pvelas" created="Tue, 17 Jul 2012 15:40:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;You are right its not affected by compression.&lt;br/&gt;
I was just curious if its problem with our python code using pycassa ... &lt;br/&gt;
So I created increments.cql containing 100k lines with 1000 increments for each of 100 key values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;cassandra-cli -h $HOSTNAME -p 9160 -f increments.cql -B &amp;gt;/dev/&lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after 3 rolling restarts each value was correct with value 3000 &lt;br/&gt;
after 4 rolling restart values are incorrect see bellow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;col1	5479
col10	5507
col100	5531
col11	5480
col12	5501
col13	5499
col14	5516
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its 2 node cluster with replication=2. &lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13417350" author="slebresne" created="Wed, 18 Jul 2012 18:31:52 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot Peter for helping out reproducing this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that when a node stops (or is drained for that matter, we don&apos;t wait for all compaction to end during drain as this could mean waiting for a very long time, at least with SizeTieredCompaction) just when a compaction is finishing, it is possible for some of the compacted file to not have -Compacted components even if the compacted file is not temporary anymore. In other words, it is possible that when the node is restart, it will load both the compacted files and some of the file used to compact it. While this is harmless (though inefficient) for normal column family, this means overcounting for counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll note that even though I can&apos;t reproduce the counter bug on 1.1 with the test case above, it is just &quot;luck&quot; as 1.1 is affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to guarantee is that we will never use both a compacted file and one of it&apos;s ancestor. One way to ensure that is to keep in the metadata of the compacted file, the list of it&apos;s ancestors (we only need to keep the generation). Then when a node start, it can gather all the ancestors of all the sstable in the data dir, and delete all those sstable that are in this ancestor set. Since we don&apos;t want to keep ever going list of ancestors however, a newly compacted sstable only need to keep the list of it&apos;s still live ancestor (which 99% of the time means keeping only the generation of the file that were compacted to obtain it). I note that if we do that, we don&apos;t need to generate -Compacted components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching patch to implement this. Attaching a patch for 1.0 and 1.1 (which aren&apos;t very different). I wrote the 1.0 version because it&apos;s on this version that I knew how to reproduce the counter bug reliably, and I&apos;ve checked that this patch does fix the issue. However, this patch doesn&apos;t only affect counter code and is not trivial per se, so I don&apos;t know how I feel about risking to breaking things on 1.0 for non-counter user at this point. I think it might me wiser to put this in 1.1.3 only and say that counter users should either apply the attached patch at their own risk or upgrade to 1.1.3.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13420930" author="jbellis" created="Mon, 23 Jul 2012 20:12:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Looks like skipCompacted in Directories.SSTableLister can be removed (since we scrubDataDirectories on startup and no new compacted components will be created).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a List means we can add an ancestor multiple times.  Suggest using a Set instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;would prefer Ancestor to LiveAncestor, since we only check liveness at creation time, so &quot;Live&quot; is misleading when iterating over them later.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the deleting code feels more at home in CFS constructor than addInitialSSTables.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;tracker parameter is unused now in SSTR.open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                            <comment id="13421278" author="slebresne" created="Tue, 24 Jul 2012 08:59:05 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like skipCompacted in Directories.SSTableLister can be removed (since we scrubDataDirectories on startup and no new compacted components will be created).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, though there is the (arguably remote) possibility that people call loadNewSSTables() (or the offline scrub from &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-4441&quot; title=&quot;Fix validation of dates&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-4441&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-4441&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on sstables having some -Compacted components. So I would prefer leaving it in 1.1 and removing it during the merge to trunk, just to be sure minor upgrade are as little disrupting as can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a List means we can add an ancestor multiple times. Suggest using a Set instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we won&apos;t have the same ancestor multiple times. Otherwise that would be a bug (and at least for counters, a particularly bad one). But for sanity I&apos;ve added an assertion to check this doesn&apos;t happen (I&apos;ve a list however, I figured that since the list will be small, the difference between List.contains() and Set.contains() will be negligeable, and it&apos;s checked in an assertion and only once a the sstable creation. On the other Lists have a smaller memory footprint. Though I admit in either case we&apos;re talked minor differences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;would prefer Ancestor to LiveAncestor, since we only check liveness at creation time, so &quot;Live&quot; is misleading when iterating over them later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the deleting code feels more at home in CFS constructor than addInitialSSTables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;tracker parameter is unused now in SSTR.open&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removed. I realized that setTrackedBy was already always call through the DataTracker.addNewSSTablesSize, so I also removed the call duplication.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think that&apos;s true.  Suppose for instance we have leveled compaction with A and B in L0.  They are larger than 5MB so we split the result into X, Y, and Z.  Next we flush C to L0.  It overlaps with Y and Z, so we&apos;re compacting C, Y, and Z.  Now we have Y and Z both with A and B as ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Switching from LCS back to STCS is another way you could get duplicate ancestors.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
