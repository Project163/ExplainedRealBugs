            <title>[CASSANDRA-2868] Native Memory Leak</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2868</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We have memory issues with long running servers. These have been confirmed by several users in the user list. That&apos;s why I report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memory consumption of the cassandra java process increases steadily until it&apos;s killed by the os because of oom (with no swap)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our server is started with -Xmx3000M and running for around 23 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pmap -x shows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total SST: 1961616 (mem mapped data and index files)&lt;br/&gt;
Anon  RSS: 6499640&lt;br/&gt;
Total RSS: 8478376&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that &amp;gt; 3G are &apos;overallocated&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use BRAF on one of our less important nodes to check wether it is related to mmap and report back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Compared to start RSS increased by ~400MB. So it seems that this is not related to mem mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will deploy &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2654&quot; title=&quot;Work around native heap leak in sun.nio.ch.Util affecting IncomingTcpConnection&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-2654&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-2654&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week. Will see if that changes anything but I suspect not ...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I was going to start a survey on the user list after the summit to see if any OS/jvm level pattern could be found, since clearly it doesn&apos;t happen to everyone in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your data size constant? If not you are probably seeing growth in the index samples and bloom filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well no - the data size is increasing. But I thought that index and bf is good old plain java heap no? JVM heap stats are really relaxed. Yet I think that doesn&apos;t really matter because what we are seeing is an ever increasing rss mem consumption even though we have -Xmx3G and -Xms3G and mlockall (pmap shows these 3G as one block). So something seems to be constantly allocating native mem that has nothing to do with java heap.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;You could try turning GCInspector methods into a no-op and see if that makes it go away.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I confirmed that -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize does not protect you from this (ie it&apos;s a native native leak, not some DirectByteBuffer thing).  I&apos;ll be able to test this but not until the end of this week at the earliest (and it will then take at least another week to be sure).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Graph of VmRSS from /proc/PID/status at 10 second intervals from my last comment to now.  Box on the left has GCInspector disabled.  These are on two test boxes under trivial load so this is all still &lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; tentative.  Will start testing under real load by early next week.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;We have been running this in production for 3 days now and rss increased only insignificantly by ~5MB a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you mean it is very helpful to control RSS increasing by removing getLastGcInfo()? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why just some of us meets the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13066057" author="cburroughs" created="Fri, 15 Jul 2011 16:24:32 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I interpreted Daniel&apos;s &quot;this&quot; to be the 2868-v1.txt patch (or something equivalent) with cassandra.enable_gc_inspector=false.  I did not find -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13066376" author="hanzhu" created="Sat, 16 Jul 2011 07:04:41 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Got it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea why only some of us reports the problem?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13066392" author="doubleday" created="Sat, 16 Jul 2011 10:29:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Well either it&apos;s environment specific or (more likely) others didn&apos;t notice / care because they have enough memory and/or restart the nodes often enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 16GB of RAM and run Cassandra with 3GB. Within one month we loose ~3GB (13GB -&amp;gt; 10GB) files system cache because of the mem leak. Looking at our graphs I can&apos;t really tell a difference performance wise. So I guess only people with weaker servers (less memory headroom) will really notice. We noticed only because we got the system oom on a cluster that&apos;s not critical and which we didn&apos;t really monitor.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13066835" author="doubleday" created="Mon, 18 Jul 2011 07:59:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Looks good to me. Guess cassandra should just disable the inspector for now (probably make it jmx&apos;able to start it manually)&lt;/p&gt;

This uses a different API which hopefully does not leak: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Modules-sun/tools/sun/tools/jconsole/MemoryTab.java.htm&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Modules-sun/tools/sun/tools/jconsole/MemoryTab.java.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging the lifetime totals there with StatusLogger similar to what we do now for dropped messages would be better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13071889" author="cburroughs" created="Wed, 27 Jul 2011 17:49:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;48 hours under production load after C* had already been running for a few days.  Two on the left have GCInspector enabled.  The two on the right do not.  (Note that the scale on the lower right one reflects a change of only 10s of bytes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it looks like victory to me.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13071895" author="jbellis" created="Wed, 27 Jul 2011 18:09:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Chris.  We&apos;ll work on rewriting GCInspector to use the java.lang.management api instead, unless you have time to take a stab at that.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13073021" author="brandon.williams" created="Fri, 29 Jul 2011 21:10:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;v2 switches the GCInspector to us java.lang.managment.  I don&apos;t know if it too leaks or not yet.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13073409" author="brandon.williams" created="Mon, 1 Aug 2011 00:56:22 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I created three isolated nodes, all with a hack of setting the inspector interval to 1ms applied (not the tightest loop, but good enough and easy.)  One of the nodes had the inspector disabled entirely (the control), one was vanilla, and one had v2 applied.  After starting them up with a 128M heap and letting them run for a few minutes, here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&apos;table-wrap&apos;&gt;
&lt;table class=&apos;confluenceTable&apos;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&apos;confluenceTh&apos;&gt;version&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&apos;confluenceTh&apos;&gt;resident&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&apos;confluenceTd&apos;&gt;control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&apos;confluenceTd&apos;&gt;72M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&apos;confluenceTd&apos;&gt;patched&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&apos;confluenceTd&apos;&gt;72M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&apos;confluenceTd&apos;&gt;vanilla&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&apos;confluenceTd&apos;&gt;540M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think it&apos;s safe to say java.lang.management doesn&apos;t share the leak.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Couldn&apos;t we estimate the reclaimed size by recording the last memory used (that would need to be the first thing we do in logGCResults so that we record it each time) ?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wouldn&apos;t it be worth indicating that how many collection have been done since last log message if it&apos;s &amp;gt; 1, since it can (be &amp;gt; 1).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Nit: especially if we decide to keep the last memory used, it may be more efficient (in cleaner imho) to have just one HashMap of string -&amp;gt; GCInfo where GCInfo would be a small struct with times, counts and usedMemory. Not that it is very performance sensitive...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not really, what we&apos;d have is &quot;difference in size between last time it was called, and now&quot; which isn&apos;t all that close to &quot;amount reclaimed by a specific GC.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&apos;t it be worth indicating that how many collection have been done since last log message&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO the duration-based thresholds are hard to reason about here, where we&apos;re dealing w/ summaries and not individual GC results.  I think I&apos;d rather have something like the dropped messages logger, where every N seconds we log the summary we get from the mbean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flushLargestMemtables/reduceCacheSizes stuff should probably be removed. &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/sad.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I added count tracking was to prevent it from firing when there were no GCs (the api is flakey.)  I&apos;ve never actually been able to get &amp;gt; 1 to happen, but we can add it to the logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMO the duration-based thresholds are hard to reason about here, where we&apos;re dealing w/ summaries and not individual GC results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are dealing with individual GCs at least 99% of the time in practice.  The worst case is &amp;gt;1 GC inflates the gctime enough that we errantly log when it&apos;s not needed, but I imagine to trigger that you would have to be in a gc pressure situation already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I&apos;d rather have something like the dropped messages logger, where every N seconds we log the summary we get from the mbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seems like it could be a lot of noise since GC is constantly happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flushLargestMemtables/reduceCacheSizes stuff should probably be removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the logic there is still sound (&quot;Did we just do a CMS? Is the heap still 80% full?&quot;) and it seems to work as well as it always has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s possible w/ a small enough heap, especially since GCInspector is paused along w/ everything else for STW collections (including new gen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;v3 attached to accomodate this and add durationPerCollection.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
