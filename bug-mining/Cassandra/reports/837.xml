            <title>[CASSANDRA-2484] CassandraStorage LoadPushDown implementation causes heisenbugs</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2484</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;After pulling hair out about why weird errors were happening loading data from cassandra with seemingly irrelevant changes to the pig scripts (mostly changing the script trying to debug other problems), it looks like the weird errors were because of the implementation we currently have for LoadPushDaown in CassandraStorage.  Unless there is a good reason to implement it, I feel like we should just remove the few lines that are in there until we can spend some serious time doing an implementation of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13020413" author="jeromatron" created="Fri, 15 Apr 2011 20:09:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;What would happen was we would be troubleshooting a bug in a complicated script and if we took out part of it we would get errors with isEmpty (something we were using but unrelated at all to the change) and then investigate more and Cassandra wouldn&apos;t return anything at all but only with that particular portion of the script running.  Then someone else was going through another kind of complicated script and getting odd null pointer exceptions and traced it back to something similar.  That made us think that pig was trying to &quot;optimize&quot; or something behind the scenes.  Then we thought it might be trying to project certain data out of the column family based on the changed script.  That led us to wonder if it had something to do with the LoadPushDown - since that is called when pig thinks it can project things out of a data store/file if it doesn&apos;t need the rest.  That would explain some of the odd behavior at least.  We commented out it out like in the patch and both errors that were independent and unexplainable any other way, were gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that&apos;s kind of a round about way of going about it, but it seems like good evidence to me that something is up with it - and if it&apos;s essentially a no-op, and it works without it, then I didn&apos;t see why we wouldn&apos;t just take it out.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
