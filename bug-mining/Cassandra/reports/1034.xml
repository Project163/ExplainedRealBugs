            <title>[CASSANDRA-2829] memtable with no post-flush activity can leave commitlog permanently dirty</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2829</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Only dirty Memtables are flushed, and so only dirty memtables are used to discard obsolete commit log segments. This can result it log segments not been deleted even though the data has been flushed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was using a 3 node 0.7.6-2 AWS cluster (DataStax AMI&apos;s) with pre 0.7 data loaded and a running application working against the cluster. Did a rolling restart and then kicked off a repair, one node filled up the commit log volume with 7GB+ of log data, there was about 20 hours of log files. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user KS has 2 CF&apos;s with 60 minute flush times. System KS had the default settings which is 24 hours. Will create another ticket see if these can be reduced or if it&apos;s something users should do, in this case it would not have mattered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed the log headers and used the tool in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2828&quot; title=&quot;CommitLog tool&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-2828&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-2828&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and most of the segments had the system CF&apos;s marked as dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CF 0 is the Status / LocationInfo CF and 1 is the HintedHandof CF. I dont have it now, but IIRC CFStats showed the LocationInfo CF with dirty ops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to repo a case where flushing the CF&apos;s did not mark the log segments as obsolete (attached unit-test patch). Steps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Write to cf1 and flush.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Current log segment is marked as dirty at the CL position when the flush started, CommitLog.discardCompletedSegmentsInternal()&lt;br/&gt;
3. Do not write to cf1 again.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Roll the log, my test does this manually. &lt;br/&gt;
5. Write to CF2 and flush.&lt;br/&gt;
6. Only CF2 is flushed because it is the only dirty CF. cfs.maybeSwitchMemtable() is not called for cf1 and so log segment 1 is still marked as dirty from cf1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5 is not essential, just matched what I thought was happening. I thought SystemTable.updateToken() was called which does not flush, and this was the last thing that happened.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expired memtable thread created by Table uses the same cfs.forceFlush() which is a no-op if the cf or it&apos;s secondary indexes are clean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the same problem would exist in 0.8. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13062653" author="jbellis" created="Sat, 9 Jul 2011 23:04:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Good detective work finding this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure about the proposed fix, though &amp;#8211; I think this reasoning still applies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;                // we can&apos;t just mark the segment where the flush happened clean,
                // since there may have been writes to it between when the flush
                // started and when it finished.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... the memtable may have been clean when the flush started, but we don&apos;t block writes until flush finishes, so some may have finished in between (so the CL may have writes for this segment now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I don&apos;t have a better fix yet, this is a tough one.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13064643" author="jbellis" created="Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:48:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thinking out loud here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLHeader has a structure to tell us &quot;do we need to replay, and if so, from where?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; Map&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; cfDirtiedAt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// position at which each CF was last flushed
&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; isDirty(&lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; cfId)
    {
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; cfDirtiedAt.containsKey(cfId);
    } 

    &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; isDirty(&lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; cfId)
    {
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; cfDirtiedAt.containsKey(cfId);
    } 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is set in two places.  One is during a write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!header.isDirty(id))
                    {
                        header.turnOn(id, logWriter.getFilePointer());
                        writeHeader();
                    }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is post-flush, as described above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (segment.equals(context.getSegment()))
            {
                &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// we can&apos;t just mark the segment where the flush happened clean,
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// since there may have been writes to it between when the flush
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// started and when it finished. so mark the flush position as
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// the replay point &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; CF, instead.
&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (logger.isDebugEnabled())
                    logger.debug(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Marking replay position &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + context.position + &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot; on commit log &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + segment);
                header.turnOn(id, context.position);
                segment.writeHeader();
                &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
            }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like we need to add a &quot;most recent write at&quot; information as well as the &quot;oldest write/replay position at&quot; one.  This would not need to be persisted to disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I thought that this is what 0.6 did, but looking at it that is not the case.  So this bug is present there as well, but I think at this point it just needs to be a known bug there.  Maybe even for 0.7.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13068931" author="slebresne" created="Thu, 21 Jul 2011 11:50:18 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels like we need to add a &quot;most recent write at&quot; information as well as the &quot;oldest write/replay position at&quot; one.

&lt;p&gt;Agreed, I think this is the right fix too.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13068967" author="amorton" created="Thu, 21 Jul 2011 13:01:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I got to take another look at this tonight on the 0.8 trunk and ported the unit test to 0.8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 002-2829-v08 patch was my second attempt. It changes CFS.forceFlush() to always flush and trusts maybeSwitchMemtable() will only flush non clean CF&apos;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no changes to  CommitLog.discardCompletedSegmentsInternal(). The CF will be turned off in any segment that is not the context segment. It will always be turned on in the current / context segment. I think this gives the correct behaviour, i.e. the cf can never have dirty changes in a segment that is not current AND the cf may have changes in a segment that is current. It is a bit sloppy though as clean CF&apos;s will mark segments as dirty which may delay them been cleaned. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also think there is a theoretical risk of a race condition with access to the segments Deque.  The iterator runs in the postFlushExecutor and the segments are added on the appropriate commit log executor service.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13069011" author="jbellis" created="Thu, 21 Jul 2011 14:55:27 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also think there is a theoretical risk of a race condition with access to the segments Deque. The iterator runs in the postFlushExecutor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;discardCompletedSegments actually does the real work in a task on the CL executor. Unless that&apos;s not what you&apos;re thinking of, I think we&apos;re ok here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It changes CFS.forceFlush() to always flush and trusts maybeSwitchMemtable() will only flush non clean CF&apos;s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm.  Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me thinks it can&apos;t be that simple but I don&apos;t see a problem with it. &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13069070" author="slebresne" created="Thu, 21 Jul 2011 17:02:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think this kind of work, in that we won&apos;t keep commit log forever, but it still keep commit logs for much longer than necessary because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;it relies on forceFlush being called, which unless client triggered will only be after the memtable expires and quite a bunch of commit log could pile up during that time. Quite potentially enough to be a problem (if the commit logs fills up you hard drive, it doesn&apos;t matter much that &quot;it would have been deleted in 5 hours&quot;). I think we can do much better with not too much effort.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;when we do flush the expired memtable, we&apos;ll call maybeSwitchMemtable() will potentially clean memtables. This doesn&apos;t sound like a good use of resource: we&apos;ll grab the write lock, create a latch, create a new memtable, increment the memtable switch number, push an almost no-op job on the flush executor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think we should fix the real problem. The problem is that we discard segment, we always keep the current segment dirty because we don&apos;t know if there was some write since we grabbed the context. Let&apos;s add that information and fix that. This would make commit log being deleted much quicker, even if we don&apos;t consider the corner case of column family that have suddenly no write anymore, because CFs like the system ones, that have very low update volume can retain the logs longer than it&apos;s really need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the fix, because the CL executor is mono-threaded, this is fairly easy, let&apos;s have an in-memory map of cfId-&amp;gt;lastPositionWritten, and compare that to the context position in discardCompletedSegmentInternal (we could probably even just use a set of cfid who would meant: dirty since last getContext).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Does it mean everytime an RowMutation is appended to the log, the log header should be fsynced again? It brings at least one extra disk seek at a critical path.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

(BTW there is no header per se post &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2419&quot; title=&quot;Risk of counter over-count when recovering commit log&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-2419&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-2419&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;OK. So these these log segments might no be ignored during log replay. Maybe not a problem at all.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13073498" author="slebresne" created="Mon, 1 Aug 2011 11:20:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Houston, we have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 0.8, we have a much bigger problem related to the commit log. Turns out we don&apos;t even turnOn the isDirty flag on writes. This means that typically if we fill a segment (with write of different cfs), starts a new one, and flush (one cf, say cf1), the previous segment will be removed even though it may be full of dirty writes for cf != cf1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching a patch that fix this issue as well as the original issue of this ticket (as it is not really more complicated). It adds two unit test, one for each issue (both fails in current 0.8). Bumping the priority of this too. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
