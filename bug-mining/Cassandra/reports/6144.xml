            <title>[CASSANDRA-17768] Restore streaming_keep_alive_period functionality on the netty control streaming channel</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17768</link>
                <project id="12310865" key="CASSANDRA">Apache Cassandra</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;While working on another ticket I noticed that after &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16927&quot; title=&quot;Mockable Streaming&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-16927&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-16927&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CEP-10 Phase 1: Refactor Streaming&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;streaming_keep_alive_period is not used anymore, except to print it in error message &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-4.1/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/streaming/StreamSession.java#L689&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the property should not be used anymore, we need to deprecate it and fix the error message as it is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

Can we clarify if &lt;tt&gt;streaming_keep_alive_period&lt;/tt&gt; is no longer needed to keep long-lived cross-dc connections active? I remember the reason this was added was due to idle connections being reset and causing streaming to fail after an inactivity period (since we used one inbound and another outbound connection for streaming, so one direction could stay idle while the other was active), not sure if this is still a potential issue after CEP-10.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Or, potentially we did not at some point previously specify keep alive at the TCP layer, but by the time of the refactor we certainly did.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="17570296" author="benedict" created="Sat, 23 Jul 2022 12:35:14 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;So, looking back, TCP layer keep alive was being specified back when this patch was introduced. But perhaps it wasn&apos;t in an earlier build that encountered this behaviour? There&apos;s no discussion on the original ticket around why TCP layer keep alive wasn&apos;t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far 4.0 has been running without application layer keep alive, seemingly just fine. Do we have any evidence this is still needed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=paulo&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;paulo&quot;&gt;paulo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17570937" author="paulo" created="Mon, 25 Jul 2022 14:47:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think the original problem &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-11841&quot; title=&quot;Add keep-alive to stream protocol&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;CASSANDRA-11841&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;CASSANDRA-11841&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was intended to solve is when operators are using networks/firewalls they have little/no control of (ie. cloud/vpn providers), and can&apos;t set recommended net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive* settings. The idea is to have an app-layer keep-alive to ensure we don&apos;t depend on network settings to keep long-lived cross-datacenter connections alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is certainly a niche feature, but I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s still useful or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few pointers to conextualize the use-case being addressed by that setting:&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="17570950" author="paulo" created="Mon, 25 Jul 2022 15:11:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think the necessity for this is significantly reduced if we use a single connection for both inbound/outbound streaming traffic, but that was not the case when the feature was added, so one connection could remain idle for long periods while the other side was active, what caused connection resets due to badly configured firewalls/networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19787-01/820-2559/using-24/index.html:&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19787-01/820-2559/using-24/index.html:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where possible, in addition to using the TCP keep-alive mechanism, the client application also must perform its own periodic keep-alive at its level. &lt;b&gt;The TCP keep-alive mechanism is not perfect in all possible boundary cases.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1122/114.htm:&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1122/114.htm:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementors MAY include &quot;keep-alives&quot; in their TCP implementations, although this practice is not universally accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</comment>

It sounds like this should be maintained, but perhaps as a netty-layer keep alive, rather than a streaming-specific one.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17571465" author="paulo" created="Tue, 26 Jul 2022 14:32:11 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like this should be maintained, but perhaps as a netty-layer keep alive, rather than a streaming-specific one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good idea to move it to the netty layer. I wonder if this would be enabled just for streaming, or for other paths as well? Perhaps we could make this opt-out for streaming? This way users would have a way to rely just on TCP keep-alives when the network supports it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17571467" author="benedict" created="Tue, 26 Jul 2022 14:35:39 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think it makes sense to make it opt-in, probably separately for streaming and regular connections. There&apos;s no point wasting application time on this if the network layer is known to provide it (and, generally, it does)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17627168" author="iamaleksey" created="Tue, 1 Nov 2022 13:46:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;So here is my current thinking on this, in particular in context of this blocking RC1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, yes, this is a regression. 4.0 &lt;b&gt;does&lt;/b&gt; trigger application-level keep-alive at this set interval, and 4.1 no longer does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 4.1, &lt;tt&gt;KeepAliveMessage&lt;/tt&gt; still exists, its handler/serializer logic is still intact. If a 4.1 node receives a &lt;tt&gt;KeepAliveMessage&lt;/tt&gt;, it won&apos;t choke, and handle it just fine. But the code to send these at the configured interval is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest we un-deprecate the param, but set the default to 0, making it opt-in. I also suggest that we bring back the logic to issue these (streaming) roughly as it was originally. That said, I&apos;m not sure this is significant enough to block RC1, given that it can be brought back without any compatibility issue in any minor 4.1 release, whenever we so desire.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="17627200" author="jmckenzie" created="Tue, 1 Nov 2022 14:59:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Chatting w/Mick offline about this. I&apos;m a little concerned about folks running in environments w/insufficient or weird TCP_KEEPALIVE that might not realize it until they upgrade to 4.1 and start having streams / channels that get killed for inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it&apos;s certainly redundant in a world w/expected tcp env, and less of a concern on a single channel vs. the older paradigm, what&apos;s the downside to us reinstating the&#160;&lt;tt&gt;KeepAliveTask&lt;/tt&gt; scheduling code from 4.0 in 4.1 defaulted to on? I have to assume the volume of messaging from this would be negligible and historically channels getting closed for inactivity has been a niggling annoyance for us, so a little redundancy in this area of our communications would be welcome IMO.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17627265" author="iamaleksey" created="Tue, 1 Nov 2022 17:27:42 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s the downside to us reinstating the KeepAliveTask scheduling code from 4.0 in 4.1 defaulted to on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there is really no downside, it&apos;s a tiny message once every 5 minutes by default. I&apos;d just rather not handle this myself at the moment, and I&apos;m not sure the issue itself justifies blocking the RC, given relative unimportance and the relative ease of reinstating at any point, including in a minor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we feel strongly that it just cannot wait until 4.1.1 at all, I&apos;ll make it happen, but this isn&apos;t as trivial as copy-pasting some 4.0 code back, post refactor, and testing + committing is going to take some time.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17627816" author="jmckenzie" created="Wed, 2 Nov 2022 15:50:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;For sure; totally respect the lack of time to do this right now + relative ease of reinstating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we hit up the dev list about it and see if anyone feels strongly about this; we have a lot of folks that are both devs and operators at scale who might be able to offer some insight. Could very well be a non-issue period, or fine to push to a point release.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
