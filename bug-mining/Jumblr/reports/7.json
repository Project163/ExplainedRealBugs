Therefore please add something like getReason() for getting the \"errors\" string in the \"response\" array included in the returned json string.\n\ngetReason() should therefore return something like \"Oh no! You've reached your photo upload limit for today.\"\n\nThe tumblr guys should have made a better job in designing the API for notifying users of API limit hits IMHO.\n","closed_by":{"login":"seejohnrun","id":64965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun","html_url":"https://github.com/seejohnrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seejohnrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tumblr/jumblr/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tumblr/jumblr/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
