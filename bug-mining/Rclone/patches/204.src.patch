+### Configuration from an Openstack credentials file ###

+An Opentstack credentials file typically looks something something
+like this (without the comments)

+```
+export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
+export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
+export OS_TENANT_NAME="1234567890123456"
+export OS_USERNAME="123abc567xy"
+echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
+read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
+export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
+export OS_REGION_NAME="SBG1"
+if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi

+the example above.
+
+```

+key = $OS_PASSWORD
+auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
+tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME
