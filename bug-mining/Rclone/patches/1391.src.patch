+### Hashes
+
+In December 2024 `files.com`  started [supporting more checksums](https://www.files.com/blog/2024/11/01/new-modern-checksum-options-now-available-with-opt).
+
+However if you want hashes you **must** enable them in your site by
+visiting the "File Integrity" section in "Data Governance" to
+configure your settings and select the checksum algorithms that meet
+your requirements.
+
+Rclone currently only support CRC32 and MD5 for use in syncing but
+selecting more checksums will not affect rclone's operations.
+
+For use with rclone, selecting at least MD5 is recommended so rclone
+can do an end to end integrity check.
