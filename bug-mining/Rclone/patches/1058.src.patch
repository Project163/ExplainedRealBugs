 git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git

+modify and send pull requests with. Then it will build the rclone executable
+in the same folder. As an initial check you can now run `./rclone version`
+(`.\rclone version` on Windows).
+
+Note that on macOS and Windows the [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/)
+command will not be available unless you specify additional build tag `cmount`.
 
-You can also build the latest stable rclone with:
+```
+go build -tags cmount
+```
 
-    go get github.com/rclone/rclone
+This assumes you have a GCC compatible C compiler (GCC or Clang) in your PATH,
+as it uses [cgo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo). But on Windows, the
+[cgofuse](https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse) library that the cmount
+implementation is based on, also supports building
+[without cgo](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WindowsDLLs), i.e. by setting
+environment variable CGO_ENABLED to value 0 (static linking). This is how the
+official Windows release of rclone is being built, starting with version 1.59.
+It is still possible to build with cgo on Windows as well, by using the MinGW
+port of GCC, e.g. by installing it in a [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org)
+distribution (make sure you install it in the classic mingw64 subsystem, the
+ucrt64 version is not compatible).
+
+Additionally, on Windows, you must install the third party utility
+[WinFsp](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/), with the "Developer" feature selected.
+If building with cgo, you must also set environment variable CPATH pointing to
+the fuse include directory within the WinFsp installation
+(normally `C:\Program Files (x86)\WinFsp\inc\fuse`).
+
+You may also add arguments `-ldflags -s` (with or without `-tags cmount`),
+to omit symbol table and debug information, making the executable file smaller,
+and `-trimpath` to remove references to local file system paths. This is how
+the official rclone releases are built.

+Instead of executing the `go build` command directly, you can run it via the
+Makefile, which also sets version information and copies the resulting rclone
+executable into your GOPATH bin folder (`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`, which
+corresponds to `~/go/bin/rclone` by default).
