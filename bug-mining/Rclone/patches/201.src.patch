+If any errors occurred during the command, rclone with an exit code of
+`1`.  This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.
+
+During the startup phase rclone will exit immediately if an error is
+detected in the configuration.  There will always be a log message
+immediately before exiting.
+
+When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
+only exit with an non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were no
+transfers with errors remaining.  For every error counted there will
+be a high priority log message (visibile with `-q`) showing the
+message and which file caused the problem. A high priority message is
+also shown when starting a retry so the user can see that any previous
+error messages may not be valid after the retry. If rclone has done a
+retry it will log a high priority message if the retry was successful.
