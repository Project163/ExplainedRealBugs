 Rclone matching rules follow a glob style:
 
-    `*`         matches any sequence of non-separator (`/`) characters
-    `**`        matches any sequence of characters including `/` separators
-    `?`         matches any single non-separator (`/`) character
-    `[` [ `!` ] { character-range } `]`
-                character class (must be non-empty)
-    `{` pattern-list `}`
-                pattern alternatives
-    c           matches character c (c != `*`, `**`, `?`, `\`, `[`, `{`, `}`)
-    `\` c       matches character c
+    *         matches any sequence of non-separator (/) characters

+    ?         matches any single non-separator (/) character
