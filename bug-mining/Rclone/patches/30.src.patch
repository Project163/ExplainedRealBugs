+Bugs and Limitations
+--------------------
 
-Empty directories are left behind with Local and Drive
+### Empty directories are left behind / not created ##
 
-eg purging a local directory with subdirectories doesn't work
+With remotes that have a concept of directory, eg Local and Drive,
+empty directories may be left behind, or not created when one was
+expected.
 
+This is because rclone doesn't have a concept of a directory - it only
+works on objects.  Most of the object storage systems can't actually
+store a directory so there is nowhere for rclone to store anything
+about directories.
+
+You can work round this to some extent with the`purge` command which
+will delete everything under the path, **inluding** empty directories.
+
+### Directory timestamps aren't preserved ##
+
+For the same reason as the above, rclone doesn't have a concept of a
+directory - it only works on objects, therefore it can't preserve the
+timestamps of directories.
