+### Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time ###
+
+You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
+different subdirectory for the output, eg
+
+```
+Server A> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
+Server B> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB
+```
+
+If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
+otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg
+
+```
+Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
+Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
+```
+
+The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be
+different in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may
+make duplicates.
