+### Scopes ###
+
+Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to
+use.  This changes what type of token is granted to rclone.  [The
+scopes are defined
+here.](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth).
+
+The scope are
+
+#### drive ####
+
+This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except
+for the Application Data Folder (see below).
+
+Choose this one if you aren't sure.
+
+#### drive.readonly ####
+
+This allows read only access to all files.  Files may be listed and
+downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.
+
+#### drive.file ####
+
+With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and
+folders it creates.
+
+So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other
+means) they will not be visible to rclone.
+
+This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want
+to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.
+
+Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.
+
+#### drive.appfolder ####
+
+This gives rclone its own private area to store files.  Rclone will
+not be able to see any other files on your drive and you won't be able
+to see rclone's files from the web interface either.
+
+#### drive.metadata.readonly ####
+
+This allows read only access to file names only.  It does not allow
+rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete files or
+directories.
+
+### Root folder ID ###
+
+You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
+that rclone considers to be a the root of your drive.  Normally you
+will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to
+use itself.
+
+However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder or to
+access the Backup and Sync "Computers" Folders/Files.  In order to do
+this you will have to find the Folder ID of the folder you wish rclone
+to display.  This will be the last segment of the URL when you open
+the folder.  So if the folder/computer backup you want to show looks
+like
+`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh`
+in the browser, then you use `1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh` as
+the `root_folder_id` in the config.
+
+**NB** the "Computers" Folders seem to be read only.
+
+There doesn't appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the
+"Computers" tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!
+
 ### Service Account support ###
