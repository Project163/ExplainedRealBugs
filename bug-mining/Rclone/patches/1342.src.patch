+### Impersonate other users as Admin
+
+Unlike Google Drive and impersonating any domain user via service accounts, OneDrive requires you to authenticate as an admin account, and manually setup a remote per user you wish to impersonate.
+
+1. In [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), open each user you need to "impersonate" and go to the OneDrive section. There is a heading called "Get access to files", you need to click to create the link, this creates the link of the format `https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/personal/{user_name_domain_tld}/` but also changes the permissions so you your admin user has access.
+2. Then in powershell run the following commands:
+```console
+Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
+Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Files
+Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Files.ReadWrite.All"
+# Follow the steps to allow access to your admin user
+# Then run this for each user you want to impersonate to get the Drive ID
+Get-MgUserDefaultDrive -UserId '{emailaddress}'
+# This will give you output of the format:
+# Name     Id                                                                 DriveType CreatedDateTime
+# ----     --                                                                 --------- ---------------
+# OneDrive b!XYZ123                                                           business  14/10/2023 1:00:58 pm
+
+```
+3. Then in rclone add a onedrive remote type, and use the `Type in driveID` with the DriveID you got in the previous step. One remote per user. It will then confirm the drive ID, and hopefully give you a message of `Found drive "root" of type "business"` and then include the URL of the format `https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/personal/{user_name_domain_tld}/Documents`

 ## Limitations
 
 If you don't use rclone for 90 days the refresh token will
