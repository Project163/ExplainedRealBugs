 ### Authentication ###
 
-There are two ways to supply `rclone` with a set of AWS
-credentials. In order of precedence:
-
- - Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by `rclone config`)
-   - set `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`. `session_token` can be
-     optionally set when using AWS STS.
- - Runtime configuration:
-   - set `env_auth` to `true` in the config file
-   - Exporting the following environment variables before running `rclone`
+There are a number of ways to supply `rclone` with a set of AWS
+credentials, with and without using the environment.
+
+The different authentication methods are tried in this order:
+
+ - Directly in the rclone configuration file (`env_auth = false` in the config file):
+   - `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are required.
+   - `session_token` can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
+ - Runtime configuration (`env_auth = true` in the config file):
+   - Export the following environment variables before running `rclone`:
      - Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
      - Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
-     - Session Token: `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
-   - Running `rclone` in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only)
-   - Running `rclone` on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only)
+     - Session Token: `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional)
+   - Or, use a [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html):
+     - Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
+     - By default it will use the profile in your home directory (eg `~/.aws/credentials` on unix based systems) file and the "default" profile, to change set these environment variables:
+         - `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to control which file.
+         - `AWS_PROFILE` to control which profile to use.
+   - Or, run `rclone` in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
+   - Or, run `rclone` on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
 
 If none of these option actually end up providing `rclone` with AWS
 credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see below).
