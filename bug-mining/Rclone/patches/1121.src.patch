+### Access WebDAV on Windows
+WebDAV shared folder can be mapped as a drive on Windows, however the default settings prevent it.
+Windows will fail to connect to the server using insecure Basic authentication.
+It will not even display any login dialog. Windows requires SSL / HTTPS connection to be used with Basic.
+If you try to connect via Add Network Location Wizard you will get the following error:
+"The folder you entered does not appear to be valid. Please choose another".
+However, you still can connect if you set the following registry key on a client machine:
+HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel to 2.
+The BasicAuthLevel can be set to the following values:
+    0 - Basic authentication disabled
+    1 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections only
+    2 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections and for non-SSL connections
+If required, increase the FileSizeLimitInBytes to a higher value.
+Navigate to the Services interface, then restart the WebClient service.
+
+### Access Office applications on WebDAV
+Navigate to following registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\[14.0/15.0/16.0]\Common\Internet
+Create a new DWORD BasicAuthLevel with value 2.
+    0 - Basic authentication disabled
+    1 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections only
+    2 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL and for non-SSL connections
