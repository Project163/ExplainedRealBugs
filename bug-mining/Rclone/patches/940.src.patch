 on the presence of a file in a directory and takes precedence over
 other rclone directory filter rules.
 
+When using pattern list syntax, if a pattern item contains either

+from this pattern list.
+
+E.g. for an include rule
+
+    {dir1/**,dir2/**}

+Rclone will match files below directories `dir1` or `dir2` only,
+but will not be able to use this filter to exclude a directory `dir3`
+from being traversed.
+
+Directory recursion optimisation may affect performance, but normally
+not the result. One exception to this is sync operations with option
+`--create-empty-src-dirs`, where any traversed empty directories will
+be created. With the pattern list example `{dir1/**,dir2/**}` above,
+this would create an empty directory `dir3` on destination (when it exists
+on source). Changing the filter to `{dir1,dir2}/**`, or splitting it into
+two include rules `--include dir1/** --include dir2/**`, will match the
+same files while also filtering directories, with the result that an empty
+directory `dir3` will no longer be created.
