+## Making your own client_id
+
+When you use rclone with Google photos in its default configuration you
+are using rclone's client_id.  This is shared between all the rclone
+users.  There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per
+second that each client_id can do set by Google.
+
+If there is a problem with this client_id (eg quota too low or the
+client_id stops working) then you can make your own.
+
+Please follow the steps in [the google drive docs](https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id).
+You will need these scopes instead of the drive ones detailed:
