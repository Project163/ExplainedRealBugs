+### rclone delete remote:path ###
+
+Remove the contents of path.  Unlike `purge` it obeys include/exclude
+filters so can be used to selectively delete files.
+
+Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes
+
+Check what would be deleted first (use either)
+
+    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
+    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path
+
+Then delete
+
+    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path
+
+That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MB", hence
+delete all files bigger than 100MBytes.
