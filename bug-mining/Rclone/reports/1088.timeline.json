these commits are identical so the changes have definitely been merged.\r\n\r\nHowever that commit had a bug in it and needed to be fixed in a61d219bcd3ffa3ee0411e7d3759c0ef5e22e495 which is probably where the problem happened.\r\n\r\nA bit of testing later, and I can confirm that a61d219bcd3ffa3ee0411e7d3759c0ef5e22e495 is definitely the problem.\r\n\r\nI've had a go at fixing this here\r\n\r\n[v1.62.0-beta.6741.5e7230150.fix-6376-local-include](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-6376-local-include/v1.62.0-beta.6741.5e7230150.fix-6376-local-include/) on branch [fix-6376-local-include](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/tree/fix-6376-local-include) (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nThe fix was simple, but I had to write a load of tests first with dangling symlinks (which I probably should have done before)! The test suite now has the equivalent of the test script of this issue in it.\r\n\r\nPlease give it a test and report back -
