In current master and 1.55, a package-scoped `startTime` var was introduced and is initialized at package init, and all elapsed times are computed since this time.  For applications that embed rclone as a library and may perform multiple transfers over the application lifetime, this value isn't relevant.  I know that library embedding isn't necessarily one of rclone's design goals, but with all the recent de-globalization of the config and filter system, this feels like a regression towards globalism.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution would be to make `startTime` scoped to a particular `StatsInfo` object, initialized at construction, and then reset along with the other counters when `StatsInfo.ResetCounters` is called.  I'm happy to file a PR with a patch that improves this if someone on the rclone team could provide a bit of guidance!\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
