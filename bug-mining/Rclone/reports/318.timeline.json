ok, I didn't realize -v still gave the stat window. I hadn't let it run long enough. So that's something! I can use that.... BUT!!!!! Here's something that I would like so see if you can figure out a way, you have all the info, so the only thing left is HOW. So currently we have this: \r\n\r\n**Transferred:**   42.317 MBytes (119.671 kBytes/s)\r\n**Errors:**                 4\r\n**Checks:**             28252\r\n**Transferred:**          296\r\n**Elapsed time:**        6m2s\r\n**Transferring:**\r\n *  var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.list: 100% done, 522 Bytes/s, ETA: 0s\r\n *  var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.postrm: 100% done, 132 Bytes/s, ETA: 0s\r\n *  var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.md5sums: 100% done, 425 Bytes/s, ETA: 0s\r\n *  var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.postinst:  0% done, 0 Bytes/s, ETA: -\r\n**Last Error:** List last error here.\r\n\r\nI say print out this format as a static block if someone uses -stats, then update the stats in place (like --info=progress2 in rync). Adding the last error that was received at the bottom. Write off all errors to a file, then list them once the transfer is done. \r\n\r\nThen once the transfer is done, the last block of stats and the errors are written off to output for peoples logs that use them.\r\n\r\nThis way you can get an update on what's going on at a glance, but you don't have a scrolling wall of text both onscreen and in your logs.\r\n\r\nOr does the new beta write a stats block when done anyway?\r\n\r\nYa know, something simple like that ***insert guy hiding behind the wall emoji

also like to see stats work without -v.  For my use case, the only output I like to see (besides errors) is a single printing of the stats when the run finishes, summarizing the entire run, like --stats 0 used to do.  That might even be a sensible default behavior.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/289982305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"balazer","id":183813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer","html_url":"https://github.com/balazer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1036802437,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTAzNjgwMjQzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1036802437","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-04-10T16:32:44Z","rename":{"from":"Rclone windows no output","to":"Make --stats without -v show in output"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/293019896","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1180#issuecomment-293019896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1180","id":293019896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MzAxOTg5Ng==","user":{"login":"Valdaun","id":8713530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MTM1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8713530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun","html_url":"https://github.com/Valdaun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-10T17:26:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T17:26:28Z","body":"+1 for --stats without -v!  I think that seems cleanest to let it be mostly silent by default, yet give those of us that relied on --stats output.   I personally used it to send to a log file and then email myself status updates a few times a day.  Knowing that it was always exactly 13 lines long (with 4 transfers) let things \"just work\".  But -v is way too verbose and fills my log with information I don't require.    It's also helpful to be able to test a command and see it's doing what you want, and getting the speed expected by letting --stats 10s run for a while.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/293019896/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Valdaun","id":8713530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MTM1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8713530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun","html_url":"https://github.com/Valdaun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Valdaun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/294400693","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1180#issuecomment-294400693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1180","id":294400693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDQwMDY5Mw==","user":{"login":"peterberbec","id":17226353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjI2MzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17226353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec","html_url":"https://github.com/peterberbec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peterberbec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-17T03:58:50Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T03:58:50Z","body":"I
