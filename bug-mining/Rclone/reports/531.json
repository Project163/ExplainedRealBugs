The code realizes this and creates a *new* `Fs` with an adjusted root folder. When doing so, it copies the already filled `Features` from the *original* `Fs`. \r\n\r\nConsider this pseudo code to get an idea of the bug:\r\n```go\r\nf := &Fs{name:  \"old\"}\r\nf.features = (&fs.Features{}).Fill(f)\r\n\r\nnewF := *f\r\nnewF.name = \"new\"\r\n\r\ndoPrintName := newF.Features().PrintName \r\n\r\nfmt.Println(f.Name, newF.name, doPrintName())\r\n\r\n// prints \"old new old\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's many options to avoid that:\r\n1. ensure in a test that `&someF == getReceiver(someF.Features().someOptionalFeature)`. It depends on implementation details, though. See e.g. https://play.golang.org/p/so-l-ZSPCSo (license unknown)\r\n2. resolve the methods in `Features()` whenever needed instead of once through `Fill()` (?)\r\n3. attempt to replace the `Features()` approach by making all optional interfaces mandatory and return `errNotImplemented` when a backend doesn't support them\r\n\r\nI have not yet looked into the feasibility of either. Maybe there's even a better solution I'm overlooking.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, I will provide a patch that fixes the specific bug for the Drive backend.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
