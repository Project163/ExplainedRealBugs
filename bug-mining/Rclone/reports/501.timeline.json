that would be great if you wanted to have a go.\r\n\r\nFirst step get the rclone source (use `go get github.com/ncw/rclone`) then change the origin to point to your fork on github.  Let me know if you need more detail here.  I should probably write some \"how to set up a dev environment for rclone\" instructions.\r\n\r\nWhat you'll be doing is making a new command.  These are in the `cmd` directory.  You'll need to make a new directory called `copyurl`.  Take a look at the other commands and see what is in a simple one (say `cmd/delete/delete.go`).  Make the new command compile (just get it to print something).  Add the command to `cmd/all/all.go`, compile rclone (go build or go install from the rclone root) and check you have a new command.\r\n\r\nThat is the first steps.  Next the coding of the actual command...  Use the [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) to make a GET request to the URL in the command line.  This will give you an `http.Response`.  To get things going use `operations.Rcat` to upload the content to the Fs you will parse out of the command line.\r\n\r\nI just remembered - we do this already in the `serve restic` command\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/6301e15b793d9e53f3dce67e11bad521358c873e/cmd/serve/restic/restic.go#L333-L369\r\n\r\nProbably what we want to do is factor that out into `operations.UploadHttpResponse` (write tests) and call that. It does the more efficient thing if we know the ContentLength.\r\n\r\nAnyway that was a bit of a brain dump - let me know if you want more help. Post PRs and I'm happy to comment on them.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/412263584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1783732660,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc4MzczMjY2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1783732660","actor":{"login":"5731la","id":13257145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjU3MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13257145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la","html_url":"https://github.com/5731la","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-11T09:31:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1783732661,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3ODM3MzI2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1783732661","actor":{"login":"5731la","id":13257145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjU3MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13257145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la","html_url":"https://github.com/5731la","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/5731la/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-11T09:31:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/412264381","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1320#issuecomment-412264381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1320","id":412264381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjI2NDM4MQ==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-11T09:48:34Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T09:48:34Z","body":"@gidoBOSSftw5731
