you can see here the chunker overlay uploads chunkers then renames them via a server-side move which doubles the reported bandwidth and or filesize transferred and makes bandwidth reporting inaccurate. Now I could do some math to determine the bandwidth usage myself, BUT, if the filesize transfered data measurement is wrong, my math will result in a wrong average bandwidth used result also.\r\n\r\nAlso maybe even more critically... I find that the chunker overlay almost randomly multiplies the --transfers flag.\r\n\r\nI think the correct function would be for a manually entered --transfers flag to overwrite some of chunker's choices.\r\n \r\nIf I set --transfers 8 and then upload 8 files that are broken into 16 total ChunkerOverlayFileChunks; it will make rclone function as if I had set -transfers 16... And if I'm trying to carefully calibrate my rclone copy/sync command in order to properly fit inside some draconian api call restriction throttling.. I'd rather in the above example for rclone to treat --transfers 8 like --transfers 4. But I can't just type --transfers 4 because if I'm uploading even larger files maybe the 8 files are broken into 80 ChunkerOverlayFileChunks and even if I entered --transfers 4 it would behave as if I'd entered --transfers 40\r\n\r\nSo ideally when a chunker overlay is told to upload 8 files at once, that should be 8 ChunkerOverlayFileChunks. AKA, --transfers 8 always means to transfer 8 source files at once. It also usually means to transfers 8 destination files at once. But in a chunker overlay those two 8's are not equal. --transfers 8 in rclone needs to always transfer 8 destination files. Which is almost always 8 source files. But inside a chunkeroverlay, 8 destination files could be anywhere from 1-8 source files. Does that make any sense to anyone but me?\r\n\r\nTLDR: the chunker overlay is harder to control, and harder to monitor than other overlays. I think if some genius reads this message, they could think of a way to improve it :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10014244351,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M5s60ImzwAAAAJU5T3_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10014244351","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"de185de215c273e787cb770c287b087f5b484022","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/de185de215c273e787cb770c287b087f5b484022","created_at":"2023-08-05T02:55:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1666364003","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7183#issuecomment-1666364003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7183","id":1666364003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5jUrJj","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-05T02:55:17Z","updated_at":"2023-08-05T02:55:17Z","body":"After fiddling around with various formats\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer Side:            0, 0 B (copies), 204, 532.182 MiB (moves)\r\nServer Side:            0 copies: 0 B, 204 moves: 532.182 MiB\r\nServer Side:            0 (copies 0 B), 204 (moves 532.182 MiB)\r\nServer Side:            0 copies 0 B, 204 moves 532.182 MiB\r\n```\r\n\r\nI decided to go for two lines.
