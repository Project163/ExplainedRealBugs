I assume Jottacloud wants to have the MD5 of the file before upload so it can verify the integrity of the file during upload. That's maybe problematic when you copy from one service to another and can't get the MD5 from the source file because you would need to download the entire file first and then calculate the MD5 before even start the upload 🤔 ","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/412861355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olihey","id":372454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey","html_url":"https://github.com/olihey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/412867897","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2462#issuecomment-412867897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2462","id":412867897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjg2Nzg5Nw==","user":{"login":"cvillabrille","id":38108596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTA4NTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38108596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille","html_url":"https://github.com/cvillabrille","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-14T13:16:27Z","updated_at":"2018-08-14T13:16:27Z","body":"Well, \r\n\r\nI have made another test.\r\nHaving this mount options done\r\n\r\n` /usr/bin/rclone mount --allow-other --config /etc/rclone.conf --transfers 20 --checkers 1 --timeout 240m --tpslimit 19 --tpslimit-burst 1 --attr-timeout 1m --low-level-retries 100 --log-file /data/duplicati_db/tmp/mount.opendrive.jotta --no-modtime --bwlimit 0 --contimeout 15s --retries 3 --stats 0 --timeout 30s dRock-Jotta:dataRock64/ /mnt/JottaCloud`\r\n\r\nI have initialized an storage repository for duplicacy (a way to fully test an upload)\r\n\r\n```\r\n# duplicacy init -e  -storage-name JottaCloud_rclone test_du /mnt/JottaCloud/duplicacy\r\nEnter storage password for /mnt/JottaCloud/duplicacy:**************************\r\nRe-enter storage password:**************************\r\n/dataready/Videos/Videos_iPhone will be backed up to /mnt/JottaCloud/duplicacy with id test_dup\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have done an initial backup of 1.7G  with :\r\n\r\n`duplicacy -v backup -stats -t nas -threads 60 -storage JottaCloud_rclone`\r\n\r\nWhile I could achieve the _Ludicrous Speed_of 7.5 Mb/s...\r\n\r\n> Uploaded chunk 338 size 9904874, 7.66MB/s 00:00:09 96.1%\r\n> Uploaded chunk 292 size 4386552, 7.53MB/s 00:00:08 96.4%\r\n> Uploaded chunk 263 size 7357673, 7.39MB/s 00:00:08 96.8%\r\n> Uploaded chunk 308 size 4039785, 7.34MB/s 00:00:07 97.0%\r\n> Listing snapshots/\r\n> Listing snapshots/test_iphone/\r\n> Listing chunks/\r\n> Backup for /dataready/Videos/Videos_iPhone at revision 1 completed\r\n> Files: 36 total, 1,672M bytes; 36 new, 1,672M bytes\r\n> File chunks: 338 total, 1,672M bytes; 338 new, 1,672M bytes, 1,678M bytes uploaded\r\n> Metadata chunks: 3 total, 55K bytes; 3 new, 55K bytes, 28K bytes uploaded\r\n> All chunks: 341 total, 1,672M bytes; 341 new, 1,672M bytes, 1,678M bytes uploaded\r\n> Total running time: 00:04:08\r\n\r\n\r\n.. it was full of errors \r\n\r\n> 2018/08/14 14:50:51 ERROR : duplicacy/chunks/d4/123dea0b66bfbb7844eadc74029f182216240b15ed041a41e657867d8b8509.dyfahseu.tmp: Failed to copy: Error 400: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Upload without md5 no longer supported.
