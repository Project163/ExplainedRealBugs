5470d34740d03e15 \"backend/s3: use low-level-retries as the number\r\n of SDK retries\" we switched over to using the AWS SDK low level\r\n retries instead of rclone's low level retry logic.\r\n \r\n This had the unfortunate attempt that retrying listings to correct XML\r\n Syntax errors failed on non S3 backends such as CEPH. The AWS SDK was\r\n also retrying the XML Syntax error request which doesn't make sense.\r\n \r\n This change turns off the AWS SDK retries in favour of just using\r\n rclone's retry logic.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is a very similar case to the the AWS SDK using retries to refresh tokens - rclone uses retries to figure out the format of directory listings.\r\n\r\nI've reverted that commit in this branch and then made us do 2 rclone retries and the normal number (10 by default) of s3 retries.
