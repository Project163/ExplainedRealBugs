there,\n\nI'm currently experimenting with rclone and the new mount functionality.\nRclone 1.33 is running in a docker environment (docker alljoysnville/rclone:latest).\nThe connection to google drive is working fine and I can upload/download file no problem.\n\nThe only problem I have is that when I add/remove files on my google drive file list doesn't change in my mounted directory. Only once I unmount and mount the google drive again, the file list will get updated.\n\nhere are the commands that I'm running:\n`rclone mount gdrive:remoteDirectory path/to/local/ &`\n`ls path/to/local` -> this will give me all the files are there.\n\nI then copy a new file into the directory on google drive (e.g. using the web interface or another computer).\nThen I look at the list of files in my docker container again. The newly copied file is missing from that list.\n\nIf I use `rclone ls gdrive:remoteDirectory` directly, all changes are reflected immediately.\n\nIs there some kind of delay to get this file list updated?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-17T19:32:48Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T19:32:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/790","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/790/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/790/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/790/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/790","id":183001819,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODMwMDE4MTk=","number":790,"title":"Until rclone wont be updating new files/dirs in mount, there is an bash script re-mount idea :)","user":{"login":"scriptzteam","id":533180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzE4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam","html_url":"https://github.com/scriptzteam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scriptzteam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-10-14T09:19:15Z","updated_at":"2017-01-09T17:52:41Z","closed_at":"2017-01-09T17:52:41Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":17803236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzgwMzIzNg==","name":"rclone","full_name":"rclone/rclone","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rclone","id":24937341,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0OTM3MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24937341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone","description":"\"rsync for cloud storage\" -
