wouldn't necessarily use the word 'update'.  'Update' involves updating the data which is not possible with a blob that is in Archive-Tier.\r\n\r\nWhile I think it would be fun to think of this as a general flag for Azure Blobs that replaces the functionality of the RCLONE --delete-before with the DELETE from Azure CLI (instead of POST or whatever RClone uses naitively) so that RClone would delete the old data before beginning a copy/sync, we can scope this as something Azure Blob Achieve-Tier specific.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend something laser specific for this:\r\n\r\n`--azure-blob-archive-tier-delete`   \r\n\r\nFor `true`, your idea is spot on.  I'd also think about having it over-write any of the --delete-before, --delete-during, or --delete-after flags (or anything else that may propagate a conflict on deleting).  No need for the CLI to pop a warning on billing cost, that kind of warning can be added to the RClone documentation.\r\n\r\nFor `false`, the error message idea is spot on...  It's be pretty bling if RCLONE could check the status of the blob (is archive?), and if it is achieve, pop the error and skip the file, else upload.  It would be cool if the error provided a few words to reference the documentation but we don't need the error to propagate a full essay.\r\n\r\nLove it...
