(Caused by a typo in a config file when I was changing which user I needed to impersonate)\r\n\r\nI assume an API call failed and rclone didn't catch it and so continues assuming we have a valid login. It would be good to catch this failed call and show an API error instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone --version\r\nrclone v1.58.1\r\n- os/version: ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.13.0-40-generic (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.17.9\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu 20.04 64 bit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
