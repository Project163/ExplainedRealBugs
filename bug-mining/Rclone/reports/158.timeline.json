Binary prefixes:\r\n  - According to the [ISO/IEC 80000-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_80000-13) standard\r\n  - Power of 2 scale.\r\n  - Kibibyte (KiB), Mebibyte (MiB) etc.\r\n  - Also known as: IEC units\r\n- Decimal prefixes:\r\n  - Used in the [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) unit system (a.k.a. the metric system).\r\n  - Power of 10 scale.\r\n  - Kilobyte (kB), Megabyte (MB), etc\r\n  - Also known as: SI units\r\n\r\nSuggestions (feature request):\r\n- Always use binary/IEC prefixes for base-2 units (KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB).\r\n- Use decimal/SI prefixes only when specifically referring to base-10 units (kB, MB, GB, TB).\r\n   - Kilo (1000), and lower, have lowercase prefix (kB), higher have uppercase prefix (MB).\r\n- Use uppercase B for Byte and lowercase b for bit\r\n- Use singular form for transfer rate, such as 10 MiByte/s not 10 MiBytes/s (if allowing MiByte notation at all, see below).\r\n   - Plural form when writing out complete words like \"bytes per second\" and \"bits per second\".\r\n- Must be clearly documented, and perhaps this is a good incentive to start a style guide document for rclone.\r\n\r\nCurrent status:\r\n- Rclone is today consistently using the SI standard notation in documentation, log output etc, but has [documented](https://rclone.org/docs/#options) that it represents binary units:\r\n\r\n    > Options which use SIZE use kByte by default. However, a suffix of b for bytes, k for kBytes, M for MBytes, G for GBytes, T for TBytes and P for PBytes may be used. These are the binary units, e.g. 1, 2\\*\\*10, 2\\*\\*20, 2\\*\\*30 respectively.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes, questions, decision points:\r\n- Single letter versions: k/K, M, G etc. Used throughout rclone, and must probably still be used - and then e.g. M should mean base 2 MiB and not base 10 MB? In case of K, use upper- or lowercase? If short for KiB then uppercase K makes sense.\r\n  - An alternative could be as [ccache](https://ccache.dev/manual/4.2.html#_common_options) uses: Single letter prefix as decimal units, and specific prefixes Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti for binary units.\r\n- Currently a notation such as \"GBytes\" and \"MByte/s\" are used, e.g. in stats display after transferring a file.\r\n    - This seems not to be part of standard. For bits there is Mbit/s and Mibit/s, but not similar for byte.\r\n    - I would say, ideally, not to use this notation, stick with MiB/s and Mibit/s. But perhaps it is well-established enough, at least in existing rclone, that its acceptable? Compared to the standard short notation (MiB/MB) it has the advantage of avoiding any bit/byte confusion (although consistent use of Mibit for bits and MiB for bytes would should with time avoid confusion as well).\r\n    - If allowed, should then use MiByte for base 2 units and MByte for base 10 units.\r\n- With the above two points we would get 4 formats for IEC and 4 for SI:\r\n    - Single (unstandard): M\r\n    - Short: MiB, MB\r\n    - Intermediate (unstandard): MByte, MiByte\r\n    - Long: Mebibyte, Megabyte\r\n- Could be made configurable, e.g. an `--si` unit to switch from MiB to MB, but will probably [not do this](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5053#issuecomment-785346251).\r\n- Could result in breaking change for people with wrappers relying on rclone's output.\r\n\r\nDiscussed here, and there are a lot of relevant input in the comments:\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5053\r\n\r\nSee also related issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3881\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1763\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1890\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/428\r\n\r\nExternal references:\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-rate_units#Conversion_table\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units\r\n- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/bits-bytes-terms\r\n\r\nWork notes:\r\n- Tree command uses third party module (github.com/a8m/tree) which shows single character prefixes when option for human readable units are specified. It uses base 2 values, with uppercase K for KiB (see https://github.com/a8m/tree/pull/10). Example: `rclone.exe tree --size --human .`\r\n- Keep config values for DataRateUnit and --stats-unit as is: plural and lowercase \"bits\"/\"bytes\".\r\n- Change output of datarate to \"bit/s\" and \"Byte/s\" (singular, lowercase b for bit and uppercase b for byte). Output of size still Bytes (plural) as before. Test --stats with --stats-unit=bits|bytes.

24 Aug 2021 from [#5237](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5237):*\r\n- *The primary format for byte units changed from `MiByte` to `MiB`*\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nRclone is already consistently using binary units for sizes, as [documented](https://rclone.org/docs/#options):\r\n> Options which use SIZE use kByte by default. However, a suffix of b for bytes, k for kBytes, M for MBytes, G for GBytes, T for TBytes and P for PBytes may be used. These are the binary units, e.g. 1, 2<sup>10</sup>, 2<sup>20</sup>, 2<sup>30</sup> respectively.\r\n\r\nBut: It uses the SI standard notation. This is, strictly speaking, describing decimal (base-10) units. Although traditionally used for binary (base-2, or rather base-1024) units as well, it may lead to uncertainty about whether values are actually in decimal or binary units.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes to consistent use of IEC standard notation when referring to size and rate, and any other values in binary/base-2 scale, and SI notation for counts and other values in decimal/base-10 units. This should make the definition explicit, and avoid any confusion. There are mostly changes in documentation, command output and logs, \r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Updated several times after comments (discussions) below, so those may be \"outdated\" now.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Split out `--human-readable` option into separate PR: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5237\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Work in progress\r\n- Things are looking up...\r\n  - Still a few decisions to make, but current version is coming close to a suggestion that can be considered, at least!\r\n  - **Beta build**: If you want to have a quick test without building it, I've released a beta here:\r\n    https://github.com/albertony/rclone/releases/tag/v1.56.0-units03\r\n- Biggest decision points (see examples below):\r\n  - Use `MiByte`, `MiB` or `Mi` as \"primary\" variant for \"non-tabular\" output?\r\n     - Uses the `Mi` format in tabular output, where space is limited,such as results from `ls` with `--human-readable`, but what about more \"non-tabular\" output, from `size`, `about` etc? EDIT: Moved to separate PR!\r\n     - Currently more or less consistently using the `Mi` format everywhere for command output, and using `MiByte` in some log messages, most importantly the stats output - where previously `MByte` was used.\r\n     - Should we switch to `MiB`? Instead of `MiByte`? Also instead of `Mi` for non-tabular output? It seems more \"standardized\" than `MiByte`, but the latter avoids confusion regarding bit vs byte.\r\n\r\n- Remaining work:\r\n  - Document decisions in a new style guide document for rclone.\r\n    - ~~There is a commit adding a codestyle chapter in existing contributing doc, but it is just a rough sketch for now, so *that* part is definitely not done!~~\r\n    - Have written down some details in more of a \"documentation-style\" later on in this pr's descriptions, with an intention of reusing it for documentation later.\r\n\r\n##### Main changes\r\n- Consistent use of binary/IEC prefix, whenever referring to base-2 units.\r\n  - Size values (that rclone has control over) are always in base-2 units. There are exceptions where external dependencies etc use base-10 - if any of this ends up in rclone input/output then decimal/SI prefix must be used to clearly identify this.\r\n  - Input:\r\n    - Accepts single letter suffix such as `M` as before (backwards compatible), and interpret them as binary units as before, but now also accepts `Mi` and `MiB` forms, without space after value\r\n    - Examples: `--chunk-size 20M`, `--chunk-size 20Mi`, `--chunk-size 20MiB`\r\n  - Output:\r\n    - Previous uses of single-letter SI prefix symbol, e.g. `M`, in rclone with an implicit meaning of binary scale, are now shown as corresponding IEC prefix symbol, e.g. `Mi` - for values that are base-2.\r\n    - Using different forms depending on situation, as before, but now with explicit binary prefix symbol: Short form `Mi`, medium form `MiB` or long form `MiBytes`.\r\n- Consistent use of decimal/SI prefix whenever referring to base-10 units.\r\n  - Count values always in base-10 units.\r\n  - Will use the existing single-letter suffixes, e.g. `M`, since they are the SI standard symbols for decimal units.\r\n\r\n##### Additional changes\r\n- General spelling and cleanup of size and rate units (continuation of #5053)\r\n  - Use uppercase B for Byte and lowercase b for bit\r\n  - Singular form of suffix, such as \"10 MiByte\", and for transfer rate, such as 10 MiByte/s (not 10 MiBytes/s).\r\n    - Plural form when writing out complete words like \"bytes per second\" and \"bits per second\".\r\n  - Stats output changed to \"bit/s\" and \"Byte/s\" (singular, lowercase b for bit and uppercase b for byte), not \"bits/s\" and \"bytes/s\".\r\n    - Kept config values for DataRateUnit and --stats-unit as is: plural and lowercase \"bits\"/\"bytes\".\r\n- Use decimal suffix for counts\r\n  - Fixes issue #5126, describing how `ncdu` previously used binary suffix.\r\n  - Also found one similar case in `about` command (described below).\r\n\r\n##### Breaking changes\r\n- Potentially breaking changes for people with wrappers relying on rclone's output related to sizes (`ls`, `about`, `size`, logs, stats etc).\r\n\r\n##### Not including\r\n- Command `tree` shows single character prefixes when option for human readable units are specified. It uses base 2 values, with uppercase K for KiB. Since this is handled within the third party module code (github.com/a8m/tree), it will not be changed to showing `Ki` etc consistent with other commands.\r\n- Optional decimal units. #1763 proposes an option `--si` to be able to switch rclone from using binary to use decimal units for sizes. This would be in line with linux tools such as df and ls, which also has such an option. The current pull request, making the binary unit notation more explicit, e.g. \"MiB\" vs \"MB\", but still there is a consern regarding input and the single letter variants: \"you really don't want chunk_size 16M in a config file to suddenly be a different size\".\r\n- Fix for #5169: Size options can not be set to value less than 1K.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Examples\r\n- Stats output:\r\n  - Before:\r\n    ```\r\n    Transferred:      189.522M / 189.522 MBytes, 100%, 100.146 MBytes/s, ETA 0s\r\n    ```\r\n  - Now:\r\n    ```\r\n    Transferred:      189.522Mi / 189.522 MiByte, 100%, 384.928 MiByte/s, ETA 0s\r\n    ```\r\n  - Possible alternative:\r\n    ```\r\n    Transferred:      189.522 MiB / 189.522 MiB, 100%, 384.928 MiB/s, ETA 0s\r\n    ```\r\n- Stats output with `--stats-unit bits`:\r\n  - Before:\r\n    ```\r\n    Transferred:      189.522M / 189.522 MBytes, 100%, 3.525 GBits/s, ETA 0s\r\n    ```\r\n  - Now:\r\n    ```\r\n    Transferred:      189.522Mi / 189.522 MiByte, 100%, 2.460 Gibit/s, ETA 0s\r\n    ```\r\n  - Possible alternative:\r\n    ```\r\n    Transferred:      189.522 MiB / 189.522 MiB, 100%, 2.460 Gibit/s, ETA 0s\r\n    ```\r\n- Log output:\r\n  - Before:\r\n    ```\r\n    NOTICE: npp/x64/plugins/NppConverter/NppConverter.dll: Skipped copy as --dry-run is set (size 152.914k)\r\n    ```\r\n  - Now:\r\n    ```\r\n    NOTICE: npp/x64/plugins/NppConverter/NppConverter.dll: Skipped copy as --dry-run is set (size 152.914Ki)\r\n    ```\r\n  - Possible alternative:\r\n    ```\r\n    NOTICE: npp/x64/plugins/NppConverter/NppConverter.dll: Skipped copy as --dry-run is set (size 152.914 KiB)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n##### Details (documentation)\r\n\r\nTerminology:\r\n- Suffix\r\n  - Used with meaning \"unit suffix of value\": Symbol or label following a value to indicating the unit and/or scaling.\r\n  - Examples: \"100 MB\", where \"MB\" is the suffix.\r\n- Prefix:\r\n  - Used with meaning \"prefix of unit\": A specifier prepended to a base unit to indicate multiples (or fractions) of it.\r\n  - Also represented by a symbol, e.g. 'k' for kilo, 'M' for mega.\r\n  - Examples: \"kilobyte\", \"kilobit\", \"kilogram\", where \"kilo\" is the prefix, or \"MB\" where \"M\" is the prefix.\r\n  - For multiples of bytes (and bits), what wikipedia calls [multiple-byte units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units), there are two main groups of prefixes for multipliers powers of 10 and for powers of 2.\r\n- Binary prefix\r\n  - Also known as: IEC prefix.\r\n  - Unit prefixes for power of 2 scale.\r\n  - According to the [ISO/IEC 80000-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_80000-13) standard.\r\n  - Examples: Kibibyte (KiB), Mebibyte (MiB) etc.\r\n      - 1 KiB is 1024 B, 1 MiB is 1024 KiB, etc.\r\n      - Note: IEC uses uppercase 'K', in contrast to SI where 'k' is lowercase (but all larger are uppercase).\r\n- Decimal prefix:\r\n  - Also known as: SI prefix.\r\n  - Unit prefixes for power of 10 scale, but (historically) also used for power of 2 scale creating ambiguity.\r\n  - Used in the [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) unit system (a.k.a. the metric system).\r\n  - Examples: Kilobyte (kB), Megabyte (MB), etc\r\n    - 1 kB is 1000 B, 1 MB is 1000 kB, etc.\r\n    - Note: SI uses lowercase 'k', uppercase 'M' and larger.\r\n\r\nBinary unit suffix variants in rclone:\r\n  - Base: `B`\r\n    - To indicate that a number is bytes, and without any scaling (no prefix).\r\n    - Input options may interpret values without suffix as `KiB`, then suffix `B` must be specified to set a value less than `1KiB`.\r\n  - Single: `K`, `M`, `G`, `T`, `P`, `Ki`, `Mi`, `Gi`, `Ti`, `Pi`\r\n    - Examples: \"100M\", \"100Mi\"\r\n    - Note: Immediately following a numeric value (no space between).\r\n    - Used when a single word is convenient, such as option input values, and when space is limited such a in output of tabular data.\r\n    - The single-letter variants without trailing \"i\" are actually SI decimal prefixes, but in rclone they will be interpreted as binary units depending on context, for convenience - and backwards compatibility.\r\n    - In input the trailing i is allowed but optional, and does not change the meaning (`M` == `Mi` == `MiB`): Sizes are always assumed to be base-2. Casing should not matter either, lowercase suffix \"k\" still means KiB, as in 1,024 bytes, and not kB, as in 1,000 bytes.\r\n        - Currently no input for base-10 values accept suffix, only raw numbers (e.g. `--drive-list-chunk` takes int value 100-1000), but if there would be any then `M` suffix would have to be treated as base-10 value for these and base-2 value for sizes, so interpretation of *single*-letter suffix depends on the context.\r\n  - Short: `KiB`, `MiB`, `GiB`, `TiB`, `PiB`\r\n    - Example: \"100 MiB\"\r\n    - Note: Space between the value and the unit.\r\n    - Limited or no use in rclone?\r\n  - Medium: `Byte`, `KiByte`, `MiByte`, `GiByte`, `TiByte`, `PiByte`\r\n    - Example: \"100 MiByte\"\r\n    - Always singular form, \"10 MiByte\" not \"10 MiBytes\".\r\n    - Primary variant for more descriptive output, log messages etc, where space is not that limited.\r\n    - Currently a notation such as \"GBytes\" and \"MByte/s\" are used, e.g. in stats display after transferring a file.\r\n    - This seems not to be part of standard. For bits there is Mbit/s and Mibit/s, but not similar for byte.\r\n    - I would say, ideally, not to use this notation, stick with MiB/s and Mibit/s. But perhaps it is well-established enough, at least in existing rclone, that its acceptable? Compared to the standard short notation (MiB/MB) it has the advantage of avoiding any bit/byte confusion (although consistent use of Mibit for bits and MiB for bytes would should with time avoid confusion as well).\r\n  - Long: `Byte`, `Kebibyte`, `Mebibyte`, `Gibibyte`, `Tebibyte`, `Pebibyte`\r\n    - Example: \"100 mebibytes\"\r\n    - Not used in rclone (except Byte).\r\n    - Plural form as suited, e.g. \"10 mebibytes per second\".\r\n\r\n##### Other examples for comparison\r\n\r\n- rsync, ls, df, dh\r\n\r\n  All print raw byte count by default, have argument `--human-readable` which shows single letter suffix as proper binary unit (uppercase K for 1024, at least `du`), with `--si` to show single letter suffix as decimal units (lowercase k for 1000, at least `du`).\r\n\r\n- git\r\n  \r\n  Short-form binary suffix (`MiB`):\r\n\r\n  > Writing objects: 100% (82/82), 8.27 KiB | 58.00 KiB/s, done.\r\n\r\n- pacman\r\n  \r\n  Short-form binary suffix (`MiB`)\r\n\r\n  > pacman -Syu\r\n  > :: Synchronizing package databases...\r\n  > testing 21.8 KiB 7.09 MiB/s 00:00 [######################] 100%\r\n  > core 133.8 KiB 257 KiB/s 00:01 [######################] 100%\r\n  > extra 1629.5 KiB 1045 KiB/s 00:02 [######################] 100%\r\n\r\n- wget\r\n\r\n   Single letter suffix for size, base-2 interpretation, short-form SI-style suffix for speed (`MB/s`) (also base-2?)\r\n\r\n  > rclone-v1.55.0-windows-amd64.zip  100 \r\n  > [============================================================>]  13.58M  6.97MB/s    in 2.0s\r\n\r\n- curl\r\n\r\n  Single-letter SI-style suffix (lowercase `k`) with base-2 interpretation\r\n\r\n  >   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n  > 100 13.5M  100 13.5M    0     0  6892k      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:-- 6896k\r\n\r\n- ccache\r\n\r\n  Size options accept suffix k, M, G, T and interpret it as decimal units, and Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti interpreted as binary units.\r\n  Output is always shown in decimal units with corresponding single-letter suffix.\r\n  \r\n##### External references\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-rate_units#Conversion_table\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units\r\n- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/bits-bytes-terms\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #5068\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n- #5053\r\n- #1763\r\n- #5126\r\n- #1890\r\n- #3881\r\n- #428\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [X] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [X] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [X] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [X] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5087/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
