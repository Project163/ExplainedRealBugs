I've gone through their docs too and there isn't a very clear explanation there either. I guess they mean to be opaque, intentionally. However, from what I can gather, it uploads media bytes first, and then writes this to a media item.\r\n\r\nI suspect (and this is JUST a suspicion, purely based on observed behaviour and on the assumption that Google's error messages say what they mean) that somehow the write isn't closed or terminated properly, causing Google to think that a write to item from bytes is still ongoing, causing even a low rate of 1 list and 1 write in ~40 seconds to max out very soon. Can't think of any other reason why this might be happening. \r\n\r\nReasonably, a synchronous upload of 1 file every 40 seconds should _not_ cause problems with `concurrent write requests` since I'd expect a file to be \"written\" as a media item within 40 seconds (ref: output in my first comment).\r\n\r\nThoughts? @ncw
