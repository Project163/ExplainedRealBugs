What is the purpose of this change?\r\nAdd mount / vfs symlink support\r\n\r\nPlease, note that it has only been tested with storj backend on linux.\r\nEspecially, macOS, windows were not

before?\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2975\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [ ] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nThe whole work has been (trashed mostly) refactored. They were flaws in the previous implementation, especially trying to use truncated names in the vfs dir internal nodes  names which lead to inconsistency when it comes to push changes to the remotes.\r\nFor this reason, the refactoring went in 2 parts:\r\n\r\n1. Add symlinks support in the VFS itself, in the form of always storing symlinks with the .rclonelink suffix, those being regular files.\r\nThe VFS Readlink and Symlink additions allow support for symlinks, even if the --links command line switch is not enabled, it's just a mater of creating a .rclonelink regular file with the target inside.\r\nThe only difference is that when --link is enabled, the VFS nodes Mode() would report the **os.ModeSymlink** flag hint.\r\nThis approach limit adding regressions in the VFS itself as there is no more names tweaking.\r\nSome more checks were also added, to avoid to allow creating / moving files / links / directories names that would clash.\r\nBy example, the VFS must not be able to create in the same directory  something called **Hello.txt** and something called **Hello.txt.rclonelink**, this is because when using the mount operation with --links enabled, we would end up with both files claiming the same node name: **Hello.txt**.\r\n\r\n2.  Add symlinks support in the mount backends, they are required to translate from the full vfs names into truncated names to the end user: **Test.rclonelink** would be seen as **Test**.\r\nWhen --links command line switch is enabled, the file system will translate any ***.rclonelink** files into * links.\r\nOn the other hand, if --links is disabled, the symlinks will be seen as regular files, with their .rclonelink suffix which content contains the target file path.\r\n\r\nThose changes comes with a rather big TestSymlinks unit test, which test all possible api and combinations.\r\nThe tests are ran for a VFS and each backends, with and without --links command line switch enabled, covering all possible scenarios.\r\n\r\nI did run the tests successfully using this bash script:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash -e\r\n\r\n# Run the VFS tests in all subdirectories\r\npushd vfs\r\ngo test -tags cmount -v ./...\r\n#go test -tags cmount -v -run TestFunctional\r\npopd\r\n\r\n# This test uses the tests in vfs/vfstest\r\npushd cmd/cmount\r\ngo test -tags cmount -v\r\npopd\r\n\r\n# This test uses the tests in vfs/vfstest\r\npushd cmd/mount\r\ngo test -v\r\npopd\r\n\r\n# This test uses the tests in vfs/vfstest\r\npushd cmd/mount2\r\ngo test -v\r\npopd\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6337/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":7,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kingston125","id":194162814,"node_id":"U_kgDOC5Kwfg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/194162814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125","html_url":"https://github.com/kingston125","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingston125/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-16T05:43:54Z","updated_at":"2025-04-16T05:43:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8292/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8292/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8292/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/8292","id":2773895852,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAQ-n5M6G_qjU","number":8292,"title":"Add

Configure the FileLu backend by adding your FileLu Rclone Key using `rclone config`.\r\n2. Use standard Rclone commands such as:\r\n   - `rclone copy` – to copy files from FileLu to local or remote systems.\r\n   - `rclone sync` – to synchronize files between FileLu and other locations.\r\n   - `rclone ls` – to list files stored on FileLu.\r\n   - `rclone move` – to move files to and from FileLu.\r\n   - `rclone lsd` – to list directories in your FileLu storage.\r\n   - `rclone about` – to check storage usage and capacity for your FileLu account.\r\n   - `rclone mkdir` – to create directories in your FileLu storage.\r\n   - `rclone rmdir` – to remove empty directories from FileLu.\r\n   - `rclone delete` – to delete files or directories from FileLu.\r\n   This backend was added to enhance Rclone's capabilities by supporting FileLu cloud storage, which provides scalable file storage solutions for users.\r\n\r\nPlease review the code and suggest any improvements.
