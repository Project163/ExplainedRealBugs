What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nSome files are being unnecessarily re-uploaded to S3 every time I run `sync`.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the cause so far:\r\n\r\n- This happens when the `NextMarker` – the key of the last object returned in a single S3 `ListObjects` request – contains a space.\r\n- e.g. in the example below the object key `a 1000.txt` is encoded by AWS to `a+1000.txt` in the S3 `ListObjects` response XML.\r\n- When setting it to the next request's `marker` parameter, rclone encodes it again, so it becomes `marker=a%2B1000.txt`.\r\n- AWS decodes this to `a+1000.txt` rather than the expected `a 1000.txt`, so any subsequent objects that start with `a` and a space are omitted.\r\n- This makes rsync think they aren't on the remote, so it re-uploads them.\r\n- I've linked a log below (with request and response bodies) demonstrating this, and a minimal reproduction case\r\n- By default this can only affect _folders_ containing >1000 files, but it becomes less of an edge case when `--fast-list` is used, as it could affect any sync of >1000 files in total\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n`v1.50.2-086-ga186284b-beta` (also tested with `v1.50.2`)\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.14.6, 64-bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nAWS S3\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nThis is my minimal reproduction case:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmkdir files\r\nfor i in {0001..1100}; do touch \"files/a $i.txt\"; done\r\nrclone sync files/ \"s3:<bucket name>\" --config rclone.conf --use-server-modtime --update --log-level DEBUG --dump headers,bodies\r\nrclone sync files/ \"s3:<bucket name>\" --config rclone.conf --use-server-modtime --update --log-level DEBUG --dump headers,bodies\r\n```\r\n\r\nrclone.conf:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[s3]\r\ntype = s3\r\nprovider = AWS\r\nregion = us-west-2\r\nenv_auth = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the second run (and all subsequent runs), the last 100 files are re-uploaded unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nIn my case, this was causing tens of GBs of photos to be re-uploaded every time I ran a sync.\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nLog from the second run: https://paste.ee/p/FQu37","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
