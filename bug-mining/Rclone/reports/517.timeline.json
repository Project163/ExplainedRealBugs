 I started with minSleep at 10ms, but that inserts a 10ms sleep between every single API call, even those that were successful.  My small test syncs more than doubled in run time (from 7-8 minutes, up to 18minutes), so my 2 hour syncs were going to be a nightmare.\r\n\r\nPacer is clearly wanting to be a generic rate limiter as well as a retrier, and I only think we need the retry behaviour (with backoff in that situation, of course) for S3.  But now that I read the pacer code, I see how minSleep 0 will lead to never backing off.  Drat.  1ms had a much less noticeable effect, but it still seems like an arbitrary delay if all the requests are succeeding.  Not sure what the true right answer is here, but I'd be ok with starting at 1ms minSleep for now.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the code to date hasn't fixed my problem.  Somehow the error is slipping out and not causing a retry.  I have either missed some call, or something more unusual is going on.

However it depends on how the AWS SDK wraps the errors - if it just uses fmt.Errorf(...) then unwrapping won't work.\r\n\r\nI looked at the AWS SDK code, it looks like it returns an awserr.Error and you can get the original error out by calling `OrigErr() error` so you could pass that to `fserrors.ShouldRetry` for a pretty good indication as to whether you need to retry or not.\r\n\r\nAlternatively maybe `fserrors.ShouldRetry(err)`  should see if OrigError exists and call that.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/418301213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/418548235","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2503#issuecomment-418548235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2503","id":418548235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODU0ODIzNQ==","user":{"login":"craig-miskell-fluxfederation","id":32622839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjIyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32622839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-miskell-fluxfederation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-miskell-fluxfederation/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T23:19:05Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T23:19:05Z","body":"That makes sense re error handling.
