is:open label:question \n\nI got a boxcryptor container on google (1,7GB, approx 5k files) and i what to have a dump of the container on my NAS (the idea is to dump it every 30 min) to have a own history using rsnapshot on the local container.\n\nso my idea was to run:\n`\nrclone copy dave_kr8: /media/dave.kr8@drive.google.com/ --low-level-retries 20 --retries 20\n`\nwith a cronjob every 30 min. unfortunately i got end up with\n`\n2016/07/13 05:59:18\nTransferred:            0Bytes (0Byte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:     25m8.8s\n`\nwhen i added just one file to the container.\n\nso from my point of view, getting a filelist from the google api is fast, comparing time and size is fast, too.\nwhat is wasting so much time? is it recalculating hashes?\n\nhow can i reduce the time for \"copying\" (the copy command) only a few new files every 30 min?\n\ni appreciate if one can give me a more detailed insight in what is going on behind the rclone command. \n\n_Edit:_\n\n*\\* hmmm, my nas is running on a ssd, and i use the noatime option to mount my filesystem. maybe this is the problem i am facing???\n\n*\\* but it's the same result if i use  --checksum oder --size-only command. or is the copy command not using the options?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/232465856","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/560#issuecomment-232465856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/560","id":232465856,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMjQ2NTg1Ng==","user":{"login":"david-kracht","id":12131511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTMxNTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12131511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht","html_url":"https://github.com/david-kracht","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-kracht/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-13T19:47:14Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T19:47:35Z","body":"https://console.developers.google.com\n-
