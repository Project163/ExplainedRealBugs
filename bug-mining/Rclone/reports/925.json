just installed the latest beta to see [dropbox polling](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2949) in action and I'm getting a couple of potential errors related to it which I'm explaining below:\r\n\r\nI've given rclone Dropbox's \"app folder\" type access, meaning I've scoped access to a certain sub-folder in my cloud drive, let's assume it's `Apps/my-media`\r\n\r\nI'm mounting my cloud files in the following way:\r\n`rclone mount {...}  dropbox-remote:/ /media-from-dropbox/`\r\n\r\nNote the `/` beside the colon since I want everything that's inside `Apps/my-media` to be mounted.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm getting the following in the logs:\r\n```\r\nINFO  : Dropbox root '': Failed to get StartCursor: Error in call to API function \"files/list_folder/get_latest_cursor\": Path root is not supported for sandbox app.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I change my command to `rclone mount {...}  dropbox-remote: /media-from-dropbox/` (removed `/` next to colon), I get instead:\r\n```\r\nINFO  : Dropbox root '': Failed to get StartCursor: Error in call to API function \"files/list_folder/get_latest_cursor\": request body: path: Specify the root folder as an empty string rather than as \"/\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and we're back to square one.\r\n\r\nI found some insight in this support ticket: https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-API-Support-Feedback/Download-on-scoped-app/td-p/462689\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the problem lies [in this line](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5049/files#diff-7070c850317ae70144b7c0544c568a183ab48d05f0210e96160c3ecf3746ff22R1258), particularly in the portion:\r\n`f.opt.Enc.FromStandardPath(f.slashRoot)`\r\n\r\n\r\nany ideas?","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5089/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
