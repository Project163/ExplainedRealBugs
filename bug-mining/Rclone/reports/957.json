:-)\r\n\r\nSo you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.52.2\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.14.4\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nI need to transfer a HUGE... Nope, not a file. A block device image. 2 TB in size - to a remote storage which *does not support* streaming uploads.\r\n\r\nThe obvious solution is using someting like `cat /dev/sdb | rclone rcat`, but...\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it does attempt create a \"spool file\", except that this will end up in a failure because, well, fitting a 2 TB file on a filesystem which can never be that big is impossible, and I can't add another 4 TB drive just for the sake of backing it up. And anyway how will I then back up this 4 TB drive?...\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAdd to \"rcat\" command an option \"hint-file-size\", which would allow to preallocate the file in advance at the remote end and then just actually stream it via standard chunked transfer mechanics (with maybe using a limited-sized cache file, but definitely not copying the whole file in the cache before actually transferring anything).","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
