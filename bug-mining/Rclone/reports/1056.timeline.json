This package was created with the intent to eventually leverage this calculator in all backends that need to do dynamic chunk size adjustments (S3 at a minimum).\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\nYes.  #4643\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6603831151,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M4qdHR2zwAAAAGJnndv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/6603831151","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"8e5e230b81c58e06f0099e6990875599f135ddcc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/8e5e230b81c58e06f0099e6990875599f135ddcc","created_at":"2022-05-13T08:25:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12219262116,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M4qdHR2zwAAAALYUySk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/12219262116","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8e5e230b81c58e06f0099e6990875599f135ddcc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/LewisHook/rclone/commits/8e5e230b81c58e06f0099e6990875599f135ddcc","created_at":"2024-03-22T18:07:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
