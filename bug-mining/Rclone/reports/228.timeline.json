This will be quite big and have `Authorization:` headers in you should strip out before sending eg `grep -v Authorization: <dirty-log >clean-log`.\n\nI've also posted a version of rclone with the race detector built in.  rclone runs a bit slower like that, but it will produce a traceback if it detects any races which would indicate more missing locking.  If you can run that with `-v --debug-fuse` and send me the log I would be grateful (the race detector will write to stderr I think so make sure you capture that).\n\nhttp://pub.rclone.org/rclone-v1.33-85-g6846a1c-linux-amd64-race.gz\n\nThanks for your help and hopefully we'll get to the bottom of this

the hints in your logs I managed to reproduce the problem with a program which did lots of simultaneous seeking.  I managed to get the race detector to fire using go tip and it showed me where the problem was.  Here is the commit message.\n\n```\ncrypt: Fix data corruption caused by seeking\n\nThe corruption was caused when the file was read to the end thus\nsetting io.EOF and returning the buffers to the pool.  Seek reset the\nEOF and carried on using the buffers that had been returned to the\npool thus causing corruption when other goroutines claimed the buffers\nsimultaneously.\n\nFix by resetting the buffer pointers to nil when released and claiming\nnew ones when seek resets EOF.  Also added locking for Read and Seek\nwhich shouldn't be run concurrently.\n```\n\nI've committed this to a branch and made a beta from it - can you have a go with it please?\n\nhttp://pub.rclone.org/v1.33-92-g4bcea27-seek-race-fix%CE%B2/\n\nIf it works for you too I'll merge it to master.\n\nThis turned out to be a complicated problem to debug - that is the danger with highly concurrent programs like rclone, but once I could reproduce it locally I knew I'd crack it!\n\nThe ACD 200 vs 206 fix was a complete red-herring, alas caused by my mis-reading of the logs!  I made a change to help with this in the future 5c967810ed15def4f5235cef7d58f26516f8bc5d\n\nThank you for your help debugging this, and I really hope this fixes it for you!\n\nPS You were spot on with your original comment: `I believe the issue is related to the frequent seeking in the file, possibly a missing lock.`

for the logs.\n\nI see the problem - looks straight forward for once!\n\nrclone attempted to seek 20 bytes beyond the end of the file to 371155456 however the file was only 371155436 bytes long.  Amazon responsed with 200 OK and the whole file from the beginning (which is technically an error - it should have given an error here).\n\nThe decrypted file is 371064828 bytes long\n\nFUSE asked rclone to seek to position 371068928 in the decrypted stream which is 4100 bytes beyond the end of the stream.\n\nThis is a legit thing for fuse/plex to do - rclone needs to check it isn't being asked to seek beyond the end of a file.  I'll have to lookup the exact behaviour required though.\n\nI think that is the problem - I'll double check in the morning!\n\nI should double check that rclone is passing the correct sizes of everything about too.\n\nThe length of the decrypted file is 4 bytes short of a major hex boundary which may be
