The list can be found in https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the change updates existing ones to use the new domain and adds missing endpoints. Only public and private endpoints are included, though I'm wondering if `direct` endpoints should be included as well. Personally, I have not used them.\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the changes here\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes, there is issue #4522 opened with IBM Cloud notification regarding domain change.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/683402212","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4522#issuecomment-683402212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4522","id":683402212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MzQwMjIxMg==","user":{"login":"kaleal","id":15032576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDMyNTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15032576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal","html_url":"https://github.com/kaleal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaleal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-30T10:17:03Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T10:17:03Z","body":"I have posted a comment on the PR.
