The idea of the vulnerability is that by triggering a path transversal on a zip file you are able to write files outside of your folder (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/29.html)\r\nHere is the vulnerable function:\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/rcd/rcd.go#L105\r\n\r\nWe are well aware, that downloads files passed to unzip only occur from a specific URL provided by rclone, so the risk is really low, but we thought we should give you a heads up.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nNico Waisman\r\nSemmle Security Team\r\nPS:\r\nHere are some examples of how other project have fix it\r\nhttps://github.com/mholt/archiver/commit/d818164a438603f1ba3fa952c7d99321f924301copenshhttps://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/commit/f5cbcbc5cc6f8cc2f479a7302443bea407a700cb\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudfoundry/archiver/commit/09b5706aa9367972c09144a450bb4523049ee840\r\n\r\nOr you could check this article:\r\nhttps://golangcode.com/unzip-files-in-go/\r\nRelevant code snippet:\r\n\r\n```  // Check for ZipSlip.
