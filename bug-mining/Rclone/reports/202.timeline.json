Rclone redoes the upload.\n\nThis seems to happen roughly 100% of the time on files of size 10-50GB that I've tested it on so far.\nThe end result of some files is that they upload fine the first try. Some files will 504 three times and then rclone will exit (it only retries the command three times).... after the third time the file is just on ACD... as far as I can tell all three uploads worked perfectly. While the error message appears almost always on these files the unneeded repetitions only happens maybe 10-20% of the time? or looking over my test files it seems the unneeded repetitions happen always on files greater than 31gb and on files 10-31gb the error message appears but then in the second round the check realizes it doesn't need to repeat and so doesn't.\n\nI'm on ethernet not wireless which is why I didn't just post in this thread: https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/183\n\nedit: here's a quote of an exact error of this type:\n2015/12/24 20:59:52 gigatribe stuff 1.5.7z.003: Failed to copy: HTTP code 504: \"\n504 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT\", no response body\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/253777896","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/712#issuecomment-253777896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/712","id":253777896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzc3Nzg5Ng==","user":{"login":"felixbuenemann","id":909587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTU4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/909587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann","html_url":"https://github.com/felixbuenemann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixbuenemann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-14T11:44:25Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T12:45:59Z","body":"@ncw I see the opposite behavior, where rclone _should_ wait for the file to appear on 429 errors.
