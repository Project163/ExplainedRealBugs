far, I have identified the reason is that in `NewFsFile`, the call to `cache.Get(ctx, remote)` now provides incorrect result. This makes the `NewFsFile` return empty string as a file name, which causes the difference between copy-file and sync-directory behaviors (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/sync/sync.go#L242).\n\nDebug statement I've added\n```\n\tf, err := cache.Get(ctx, remote)\n\tfs.Debugf(nil, \"NewFsFile - cache.Get: remote=%q f=%v err=%v\" , remote, f, err)\n```\n\n#### Debug message without any options\n\n```\nDEBUG: NewFsFile - cache.Get: remote=\"local9:file1.txt\" f=http://localhost:9999/ err=<nil>\n```\n\n#### Debug message  with `--http-no-head` option (provides the same results as `--http-url ...`)\n\n```\nDEBUG: NewFsFile - cache.Get: remote=\"local9:file1.txt\" f=http://localhost:9999/ err=is a file not a directory\n```\n\nThat just confirms that it's somehow related to cache. Don't understand how yet.\nWhat bugs me is that `f=http://localhost:9999/` and not `f=http://localhost:9999/file1.txt` (but I'm not sure whether it's even related).\n\n---\n\nUpdate: Okay, found out what the issue is and why. But I have no idea how the cache is supposed to work, so I'm not sure what the correct fix should be.\n\nWhat causes different behavior between no command line options and having some command line overrides (e.g. `--http-no-head`) is the added suffix when override is detected.\n\n> DEBUG : http_sync: detected overridden config - adding \"{NBTUO}\" suffix to name\n> DEBUG : fs cache: renaming child cache item \"http_sync:file1.txt\" to be canonical for parent \"http_sync{NBTUO}:file1.txt\"\n\nThat affects the `canonicalName != canonicalFsString` condition: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/2a1e28f5f5683eaba22d67a0e253c95b934f8c41/fs/cache/cache.go#L117\n\nWhich then calls `addChild`: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/2a1e28f5f5683eaba22d67a0e253c95b934f8c41/fs/cache/cache.go#L135\n\nAnd finally the difference shows as result of `getError(fsString, err)`:\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/2a1e28f5f5683eaba22d67a0e253c95b934f8c41/fs/cache/cache.go#L139\n\nThat's because the `getError` treats `ErrorIsFile` somehow specially and if the file is not found by `isChild` (it won't because `addChild` was never called on it), the error is dropped.\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/2a1e28f5f5683eaba22d67a0e253c95b934f8c41/fs/cache/cache.go#L85-L93\n\n---\n\nAfter looking at the code even more, I think following patch should do it.\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/fs/cache/cache.go b/fs/cache/cache.go\nindex 0ab2492ce..1764d31d1 100644\n--- a/fs/cache/cache.go\n+++ b/fs/cache/cache.go\n@@ -83,13 +83,10 @@ func isChild(child string) bool {\n \n // ensures that we return fs.ErrorIsFile when necessary\n func getError(fsString string, err error) error {\n-\tif err != nil && err != fs.ErrorIsFile {\n-\t\treturn err\n-\t}\n-\tif isChild(fsString) {\n+\tif err == nil && isChild(fsString) {\n \t\treturn fs.ErrorIsFile\n \t}\n-\treturn nil\n+\treturn err\n }\n \n // GetFn gets an fs.Fs named fsString either from the cache or creates\n```\n\n`getError` is only called in scope of `GetFn` and at that point, all errors except `ErrorIsFile` are already handled and returned early by https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/2a1e28f5f5683eaba22d67a0e253c95b934f8c41/fs/cache/cache.go#L108-L113\n\nBut at that point, it would be probably better to just get rid of `getError` and inline the error handling logic.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2702419055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zlondrej","id":5196749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTY3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5196749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej","html_url":"https://github.com/zlondrej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zlondrej/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16614707737,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M6sx5IizwAAAAPeUFIZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/16614707737","actor":{"login":"darthShadow","id":6824881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjQ4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6824881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow","html_url":"https://github.com/darthShadow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-06T10:16:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16617131042,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M6sx5IizwAAAAPedUwi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/16617131042","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7dd1259ec967f5dc4a26d2de8dabc116c321d69c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nielash/rclone/commits/7dd1259ec967f5dc4a26d2de8dabc116c321d69c","created_at":"2025-03-06T13:16:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2703836647","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8428#issuecomment-2703836647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8428","id":2703836647,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6hKUXn","user":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"cre
