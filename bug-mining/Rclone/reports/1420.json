We are investigating an issue reported by a customer which seems to show that the client is using rclone and is doing a copyfile from file A to file B followed by a renamefile from file C to file B.\n\nIt seems that in Azure Files copy() wrapper routine as referred here : https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/backend/azurefiles/azurefiles.go#L1316 does not poll for the completion of the copy before returning.\nIn similar code for Azure Blob, for the copy() wrapper routine, https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/backend/azureblob/azureblob.go#L1987\nwe can see that the rclone client is polling whether copyStatus is CopyStatusTypePending or not, as shown below, which is missing for Azure FIles.\n\n\t// Poll for completion if necessary\n\t//\n\t// The for loop is never executed for same storage account copies.\n\tcopyStatus := startCopy.CopyStatus\n\tgetOptions := blob.GetPropertiesOptions{}\n\tpollTime := 100 * time.Millisecond\n\tfor copyStatus != nil && string(*copyStatus) == string(container.CopyStatusTypePending) {\n\t\ttime.Sleep(pollTime)\n\t\tvar getMetadata blob.GetPropertiesResponse\n\t\terr = f.pacer.Call(func() (bool, error) {\n\t\t\tgetMetadata, err = dstBlobSVC.GetProperties(ctx, &getOptions)\n\t\t\treturn f.shouldRetry(ctx, err)\n\t\t})\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn nil, err\n\t\t}\n\t\tcopyStatus = getMetadata.CopyStatus\n\t\tpollTime = min(2*pollTime, time.Second)\n\t}\n\nDue to this bug on the client, we can run into an edge case which can make the file inaccessible for the client. \n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\nrclone version shows up on the server as v1.71.0\nThis seems to be a day 0 issue from when the azure files support was added. i.e v1.65.0 from 2023-11-26 onwards\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\nAt this point, it is not clear from how the customer is using rclone\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\nAzure Files\n\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\nFrom the signature that I see on the server, the customer is doing a copyfile followed by renamefile using REST.\n\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\nI do not have that information.\n\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
