But I'm not sure I'd consider rounding down to be less accurate than rounding up, if thought of as just a loss of decimal places. And there is an advantage to truncating instead of rounding, as it means you can then use `.After()` to reliably determine which of two times has the greater precision.

I guess not since it is comparing two backends.\r\n\r\nOr alternatively we could do a bit of analysis... Let's say the backend A has a precision of PA, and B with PB and PA < PB\r\n\r\n- precise time: t on source\r\n- backend A time, tA = (t-PA, t+PA)  # this is the test that modify window does `(...)` being the open interval not including the endpoints\r\n- backend B time: tB = (t-PB, t+PB)\r\n\r\nWe are comparing using PA (being the smaller) so we compare tB to see if it is in (t-PA, t+PA) which it should be since PB<PA. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what is happening in the bisync code so I've stopped the analysis here, but it gives us something to think about.\r\n\r\nI think the truncation is throwing things out. Truncation effectively subtracts Precision/2 on average from the times.\r\n\r\n\r\n> > That would make the timestamps less accurate wouldn't it?\r\n> \r\n> In a sense yes, as any loss of precision is, by definition, less accurate. But I'm not sure I'd consider rounding down to be less accurate than rounding up, if thought of as just a loss of decimal places. And there is an advantage to truncating instead of rounding, as it means you can then use `.After()` to reliably determine which of two times has the greater precision.\r\n\r\nI think if we want the backends to reliably round down then we will have to make an integration test for it and enforce it which is possible, but a fair amount of work.\r\n\r\nDo you think that is the way we should be going?\r\n\r\nAlso note my concerns above about causing lots of resyncing!

I'm now remembering that the truncation stuff dates back to a time before we did that. Back then, it was problematic to save a listing with `12:54:49.7` for a backend that can't handle that precision, as on the next run the backend would report the time as `12:54:50` and bisync would think the file had changed. So the truncation was a workaround to anticipate this and proactively record the time with the precision we expect to receive next time. \r\n\r\nBut now that we do consider the `modifyWindow`, I don't think it's a problem to save the time with extra precision. On the next run, bisync will compare it to the rounded time reported and if it's within the `modifyWindow`, it will treat them as equivalent. And therefore it should not matter whether the backend rounds up or down.\r\n\r\nI will try this with the integration tests to make sure I'm not missing something, but I am optimistic that this is the

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nBefore this change, bisync proactively converted modtime precision when greater than what the destination backend supported. \r\n\r\nThis dates back to a time before bisync considered the `modifyWindow` for same-side comparisons. Back then, it was problematic to save a listing with `12:54:49.7` for a backend that can't handle that precision, as on the next run the backend would report the time as `12:54:50` and bisync would think the file had changed. So the truncation was a workaround to anticipate this and proactively record the time with the precision we expect to receive next time.\r\n\r\nHowever, this caused problems for backends (such as `dropbox`) that round instead of truncating as bisync expected.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, bisync preserves the original precision in the listing (without conversion), even when greater than what the backend supports, to avoid rounding error. On the next run, bisync will compare it to the rounded time reported by the backend, and if it's within the `modifyWindow`, it will treat them as equivalent.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n- #8025 \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution
