We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nDocker image tag 1.50\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nGetting metrics of jobs into a Prometheus scrapable format or pushing into Pushgateway. In a Kubernetes world, where rclone runs as a (Cron)job for backing up application data (e.g. S3 mirroring), the monitoring of jobs and failures is cumbersome. Usually it's done with Prometheus as it's the default monitoring solution.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThe current method of providing CLI flag `--rc --rc-addr \"0.0.0.0:5572\"` will enable a webserver that responds with a JSON when accessing `/core/stats`. It would be nice if we can alter the query (e.g. ?format=prometheus) so that it would provide the metrics in OpenMetrics/Prometheus format. That probably should also become a GET request instead of POST. Or another solution altogether.\r\n\r\nWe maintain currently a dedicated project https://github.com/vshn/rclone-exporter that does the JSON-to-prometheus translation, but we figure it's best if it's directly integrated into rclone. For testing purposes one could use this side-project in the meantime.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3858/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
