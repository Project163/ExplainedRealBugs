Nick, thank you for your quick reply and diagnose of the issue. It surprised me as well to find it, \r\n\r\nMy use case is within a configuration management context using Ansible, where I'm using restic to configure backups for many servers and restic is using rclone as backend. Ansible is the one editing directly the `.ini` configuration file (gathering the rclone remote name, type and secrets from other sources), so it didn't go through the rclone config  process.\r\n\r\nAn alternative, fail-safe approach for this and future cases, may be:\r\n\r\n1. If the `:` character is detected then compare the \"remote\" part directly with the name of configured remotes in the configuration file. \r\n2. If the name exists and is not a valid name (running it through the regex validation), fail with an error message. Or maybe just fail if `:` is detected and the remote name is invalid without actually checking the configuration file.\r\n\r\nAnother way, a little more expensive perhaps,  may be to simply validate all the remote names against the regex each time rclone reads its configuration and also fail in case any errors are detected. \r\n\r\nThis way if somebody edits a remote directly in the ini file or via automated processes as in my case, it will always fail early and ensure that the remote names are valid.\r\n\r\n**Possible backward compatibility issues**\r\n\r\nIf `.` is added to the regex then somebody that edited the remote manually or via automated processes as me, and hasn't been aware that the files are being stored locally (which is easy if the backups server has enough space and you have many remote configurations) may have a surprise to see all its files \"disappear\" from the remote after the upgrade (but they have been really on the local storage for the whole time). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/527966676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"diegosainz","id":792702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/792702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz","html_url":"https://github.com/diegosainz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diegosainz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/528069666","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3506#issuecomment-528069666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3506","id":528069666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODA2OTY2Ng==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T20:22:26Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T20:22:26Z","body":"> An alternative, fail-safe approach for this and future cases, may be:\r\n> \r\n> 1.
