Can we somehow mount all remotes at once, mount every all remotes using one mount command?\r\nIf we can wrap several remotes using one name in the config file, then a single mount command to mount several specific remotes would be very helpful also.  Mount and unmount (fusermount -u) should create and delete the remote root folder for each remote under one mount point.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1094375723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dandar","id":157369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar","html_url":"https://github.com/dandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6469279930,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M47XGg3zwAAAAGBmWC6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/6469279930","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e62b9d017ddcf1423a4aad585ba7bf603c8fd289","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/e62b9d017ddcf1423a4aad585ba7bf603c8fd289","created_at":"2022-04-21T09:03:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1104917912","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5600#issuecomment-1104917912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5600","id":1104917912,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5B27WY","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-21T09:06:02Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T09:06:02Z","body":"I
