This will allow modified times, hashes and other improvements that the nextcloud vendor previously provided & potentially future extensions to work when using rclone with a webdav remote connecting to a webdav server hosted by `rclone serve`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nFor now add a `rclone` vendor to list of vendors, then allow use of those extended features (modify times, hashes, etc) using that vendor rather than only nextcloud/owncloud/fastmail\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
