Thanks for helping me pin it down.\n\nIt turns out that the problem is to do with the `/somedir/` - if you just use a bucket `b2pabilder:b2test20160218` then everything will work as expected.\n\nWhen I've fixed the problem I'll post a beta here for you to try.\n\nAnd for the answer to your questions\n\n> Authorize\n> List buckets (why??)\n\nThe reason why rclone does list buckets is to get the ID of the bucket given the name.  There isn't an API call to do that (if you can find one I'd be grateful!).\n\n> List files one by one (<-- PROBLEM)\n> Create bucket (what the heck??)\n\nrclone creates the destination bucket when you are about to write to it. (It also does when doing `--dry-run` see #342 which will get fixed shortly!)\n\nIt is easier to try to create the bucket than to check it exists.\n\n> List all files in one go (as expected!)\n>
