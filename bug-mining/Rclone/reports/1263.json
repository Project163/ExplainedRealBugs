You can easily know how much your space usage is increased.\r\nHowever, for deleted files on sync, you don't know how many bytes you're freeing from the remote. Knowing that might be useful.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nPrinting deleted files' size totals in summary.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
