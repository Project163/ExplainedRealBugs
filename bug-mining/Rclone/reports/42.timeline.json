doing a sync with a large folder (188451 files), I received a few errors (56 files). Out of these few errors most where due to a \"Failed to grab locks\". I did some research and it looks like this is a generic API error as explained here: https://www.dropboxforum.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/204555365-Failed-to-grab-locks. Their recommended solution is to simply retry the failed files. Does rclone attempt to retry? If not, can it?

\n\nGreat! I dived into the code some bit and I found there are some other places that may also need this \"ignored files\" function. For example, the [`fs.Check`](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/fs/operations.go#L501) function currently doesn't handle the ignored files on local side so the comparison always shows the changes of `.DS_Store` and others.\n\nFurthermore, I noticed there will be [some other rsync features](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/notes.txt#L42) be implemented in future.
