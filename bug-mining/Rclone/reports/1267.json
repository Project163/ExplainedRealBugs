For example, passing  --crypt-strict-names or --crypt-password or --crypt-password2. This error apparently happens because the --crypt* command line options cause `detected overridden config - adding \"{-7R5S}\" suffix to name`. Later validations on this temporary config name cause this error:\r\n```\r\nListJSON failed to load config for crypt remote: config name contains invalid characters - may only contain numbers, letters, _, -, ., +, @ and space, while not start with - or space, and not end with space\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.66.0\r\n- os/version: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 23H2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 10.0.22631.3447 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: windows\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.22.1\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n```\r\n\r\nand latest beta\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.67.0-beta.7927.b2f6aac75\r\n- os/version: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 23H2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 10.0.22631.3447 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: windows\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.22.2\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro 23H2 (64 bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
