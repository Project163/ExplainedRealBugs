sorry if this is answered elsewhere but I couldn't find it in that case.\r\n\r\nI want to replace my current `Owncloud+Owncloud client (Linux)+FolderSync(Android)` setup with `Drive+Rclone+FolderSync`. But there is one thing I can't figure out how to do with rclone — smart two-way deletion synchronization. Which means: if a file was present on both server (Drive) and local machine, and then was deleted on either of them, the file will be eventually removed on both regardless of which direction you run `sync` first. Same, if a file was added on either server or client, it will be uploaded to the other one.\r\n\r\nCan rclone do that, and if doesn't is there a chance of such functionality in future?\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
