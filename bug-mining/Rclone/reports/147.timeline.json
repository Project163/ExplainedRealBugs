I found the following:\n- The removed need for a separate goroutine in the called function generally make them easier to implement. \n- It is a relatively small conversion. Adding abort functionality is pretty easy as well.\n- `fs.Stats.Error()` could also be called automatically from `x.SetError()`, further simplifying error handling.\n- Additional parameters will have to be added to the ListOpts interface, it will not be directly accessible fields. Neither pro nor con IMO.\n\nIf x.SetError() is called, it will cause x.Add() to return true. There could be a separate `x.Aborted() bool` call, but I didn't see a need for it in the three implementations I did.\n\nGenerally, I think it serves what we are looking for. It is very likely some things could probably be tweaked.

think.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/174891701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"klauspost","id":5663952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjM5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5663952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost","html_url":"https://github.com/klauspost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":554854183,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU1NDg1NDE4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/554854183","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"33d885a6acff09727c701578c254d8ce666a296b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/33d885a6acff09727c701578c254d8ce666a296b","created_at":"2016-02-18T10:09:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":573401442,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU3MzQwMTQ0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/573401442","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fadf4b7e721819f800dc050b5f24ab8c5fdfa5df","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/fadf4b7e721819f800dc050b5f24ab8c5fdfa5df","created_at":"2016-03-01T17:46:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":636729549,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDYzNjcyOTU0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/636729549","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f16207e02cfa7bfd97ebd08d066e39c26c56c5f3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/f16207e02cfa7bfd97ebd08d066e39c26c56c5f3","c
