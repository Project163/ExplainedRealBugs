It looks strange to me:\r\n```\r\nsftp cmd = /C:/test\\ folder/example1/file1.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that rclone before passing command to the SSH remote invoker, should turn both command and parameter (or just parameter if command is in PATH) into absolute windows paths, like in this pseudo-example:\r\n```\r\nC:\\path\\to\\hash_command.exe X:\\path\\to\\remote\\folder\\example1\\file1.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Offtopic**: in future it might be useful to configure passing other cli args into the command via template with macros like the coined example `md5_command = md5sum.exe /opt1 {abs_win_path} /opt2 {slash_rel_path}`, but it's out of scope for this ticket.

I'm afraid that rclone cannot generally assume that. Depending on concrete SSHd they can pass to CMD or just parse directly.\r\n\r\nNo, I did not assume that in my comment (if that was what you meant). Escaping spaces is not something I would rely on at all, in Windows. One could do that specifically for PowerShell, but it uses the special backtick escape character and not backslash anyway.  So I would say either no quotes, and *hope* the sshd adds quotes as necessary before passing to shell/API, or wrap in double quotes (when spaces, or perhaps always). But I do not have much experience with ftp, and not the complete picture of this case either, perhaps..\r\n\r\nGitHub repo for Windows' port of OpenSSH is https://github.com/PowerShell/openssh-portable for source and https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH for issue tracking, and mentions quite a few issues about quotes etc. And also I've seen the following comment:\r\n> We need to consolidate these changes into posix_spawn* logic and call posix_spawn* from session.c (instead of CreateProcess).\r\n\r\nDon't know the current status on this...\r\n\r\nGuessing the code used for executing command on windows is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/openssh-portable/blob/5cb32671670f599f97075c396ba68af2d9bb27b3/contrib/win32/win32compat/w32-doexec.c#L240\r\n\r\nIt seems to me one can supply unescaped, unquoted path, and it will be wrapped in quotes if necessary. Though there is a registry option to disable this, and there is pty vs non-pty, and conditions on type of shell etc.. Would need to spend some more time than I have right now at least, for investigating, and probably testing, to know for sure.\r\n\r\n> Not only that. I see another problem with path being relative. OK, rclone can treat it relative to the remote root.\r\nWill SSHd treat it relative to what? user home, OpenSSH install dir, C:\\windows\\system32?\r\n\r\nOh, yes, you mean when specifying `--sftp-sha1sum-command \"sha1sum\"`, that sha1sum is relative path to executable that sshd should run? I would not rely on any assumptions on what that resolves according to, nor think rclone should do anything about it. Isn't this a responsibility of the user? If the command is in PATH then it could be given as in that example, otherwise should use absolute path?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/951742140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/951752224","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5758#issuecomment-951752224","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5758","id":951752224,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M44upYg","user":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T09:25:55Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T09:25:55Z","body":"> Oh, yes, you mean when specifying --sftp-sha1sum-command \"sha1sum\", that sha1sum is relative path to executable that sshd should run?\r\n\r\nNo. I don't expect problems with Xsum executable.
