tools like the the AWS S3 Console, S3 network drives / fuse filesystems and various other tools create \"directories\" on S3 by creating zero byte keys that end with a slash to emulate empty

exist.\n\nInstead rclone should detect these keys and treat them like a directory.\n\nThe keys are easy to detect, because they always end with a slash and have a content-length of 0 bytes.\n\nHere's
