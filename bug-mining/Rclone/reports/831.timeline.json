These credentials are indeed the latter; just the`token` field in the rclone config. As for the naming convention, I'm a bit stumped myself as to what would be best to call it; Perhaps `--dropbox-token` would be more intuitive? Please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nWith regards to \"Would storing the credentials in a file be easier for people?\"; I personally think that (outside of corporate environments) storing the creds in the config file as-is is just fine. It also feels quite intuitive.\r\n\r\nI've gone ahead and created a [WIP branch](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/pull/2852). The gist of the changes are as follows: \r\n\r\n1.  The addition of the `--dropbox-token `flag in `backend/dropbox/dropbox.go`:\r\n```\r\nif opt.Token != \"\" {\r\n\t\tconfig.SetValue(name, config.ConfigToken, opt.Token)\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n2. And the addition of a `SetValue` method in `fs/config/config.go`(as opposed to use of `SetValueAndSave`), such that only the runtime config is modified, rather than runtime config + the `rclone.conf` file.\r\n```\r\n// SetValue sets the key to the value and saves just that\r\n// value in the RUNTIME config. No changes are writen\r\n// back to the users on-disk config file.\r\nfunc SetValue(name, key, value string) (err error) {\r\n\t// Set the value in the runtime config only\r\n\tgetConfigData().SetValue(name, key, value)\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts on the implementation. Everything builds and works great on my end (I tested with an rclone lsjson). This change was much smaller than I initially anticipated, but I'm not sure if these changes (particularly the additional `SetValue`) method are the correct way to do it.\r\n\r\nThank

I can confirm that just adding a `config.ConfigToken` option to the options list works as expected. `oauthutil` can handle everything from there. It should be quick work to sprinkle that option in where needed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./rclone --dropbox-token '{\"access_token\":\"foo\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expiry\":\"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z\"}' lsl :dropbox:\r\n   320669 2020-01-23 20:00:13.000000000 test1.txt\r\n   357605 2020-01-23 20:00:25.000000000 test2.txt\r\n   320669 2020-01-23 20:00:13.000000000 test3.txt\r\n   357605 2020-01-23 20:00:25.000000000 test4.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn terms of factoring these options out do you have anything particular in mind? Would we want these options to still be exposed as `--$BACKEND-client-id`, etc.? We could add global flags like `--oauth-token`. That would work for my particular use case since I'm interested in generating configs on the fly with the `:backend:` syntax (syncing to/from the local fs). This might not provide as much flexibility to users who are performing actions between two oauth backends. Best of both worlds might be to maintain these backend specific options but add support for global flags like `--oauth-token`, `--oauth-client-id`, `--oauth-client-secret`.
