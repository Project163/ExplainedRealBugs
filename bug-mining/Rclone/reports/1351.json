I tried many different things, but couldn't get it working.\n\nIn my desparation, I also tried version 1.57 and suprisingly, there everything worked smoothly out of the box and I could link rclone with Box and start my download. \n\nSo, apparently, something happened along the way from version 1.57 to 1.67/69 that prevents Box to use the correct redirect_uri and it uses localhost that creates a mismatch. \n\nQuick solution: Use version 1.57 \n\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
