We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nAndys-iMac-2:andyibanez andyibanez$ rclone version\r\nrclone v1.48.0\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nNot a problem specific to me, but I feel some remotes should be easier to configure for first time users. In particular, a popular remote (Google Drive) has become much more difficult to configure over the past few releases. I was working on updating [my rclone guide](https://www.andyibanez.com/rclone-encryption-tutorial/) and I noticed that Google Drive now asks for many things that are going to be left blank most of the time.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nSome configuration options should be hidden under advanced configuration (when rclone asks you if you want to use advanced config).\r\n\r\nThe `scope` should be hidden in advanced settings.\r\n\r\n```\r\nScope that rclone should use when requesting access from drive.\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own value\r\n 1 / Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder.\r\n   \\ \"drive\"\r\n 2 / Read-only access to file metadata and file contents.\r\n   \\ \"drive.readonly\"\r\n   / Access to files created by rclone only.\r\n 3 | These are visible in the drive website.\r\n   | File authorization is revoked when the user deauthorizes the app.\r\n   \\ \"drive.file\"\r\n   / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.\r\n 4 | This is not visible in the drive website.\r\n   \\ \"drive.appfolder\"\r\n   / Allows read-only access to file metadata but\r\n 5 | does not allow any access to read or download file content.\r\n   \\ \"drive.metadata.readonly\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame with `root_folder_ID`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nID of the root folder\r\nLeave blank normally.\r\nFill in to access \"Computers\" folders. (see docs).\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\nroot_folder_id> \r\n```\r\n\r\n`service_account_file` should definitely be an advanced setting. I don't imagine most people using rclone with Drive are using this specific setting.\r\n\r\n```\r\nService Account Credentials JSON file path \r\nLeave blank normally.\r\nNeeded only if you want use SA instead of interactive login.\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\nservice_account_file> \r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm also debating whether `client_id` and `client_secret` should also be an advanced setting. On one hand I think they should be. On the other hand I think it's important people change this setting for this specific remote.","closed_by":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
