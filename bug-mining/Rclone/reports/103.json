Except for one large file which failed to copy. The file is ~11GB in size. Google Drive has sufficient storage available. This is what I'm getting:\n\n```\nrclone copy -v acd:/Videos/Raw/footage.m2ts drive:/Videos/Raw/              \n.\n2015/11/08 19:52:25 footage.m2ts: Failed to open: HTTP code 400: \"400 Bad Request\", reponse body: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<Error><Code>InvalidArgument</Code><Message>Only one auth mechanism allowed; only the X-Amz-Algorithm query parameter, Signature query string parameter or the Authorization header should be specified</Message><ArgumentName>Authorization</ArgumentName>\n...\n</Error>\n2015/11/08 19:52:25 Attempt 1/3 failed with 1 errors\n```\n\nBefore I successfully syncronized/copied around 300 GB of data without problem. It only failed on this file, which is also the only file that large (others are < 4GB).\n\nI then tried copying the file from ACD to local instead, but got the same error. Downloading it via Amazon Cloud Drive Web gui works without problem.\n\nrclone v1.24 (linux 64bit) used.\n\nCheers\nAlex\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
