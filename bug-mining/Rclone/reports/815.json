Most appear to be stuck at 0; the only one that doesn't is `rclone_errors_total`, which appears correct.\r\n\r\nAs an example, after having started up an `rcd` instance and sent it a few jobs, this is the output of `/metrics`:\r\n```\r\n# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the pause duration of garbage collection cycles.\r\n# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds

numbers:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14872/84528541-e2a4eb00-acad-11ea-8261-2142462da7d5.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, `rclone_errors_total` is 13, which is correct, but fields like `rclone_checked_files_total`, `rclone_bytes_transferred_total`, `rclone_speed`, `rclone_files_transferred_total`, etc, are all stuck at 0 incorrectly.\r\n\r\n(Technically, I'm not 100% sure if the `process_*` variables are correct either, but they're at least not 0 and seem reasonable so I'm not doubting them at this time)\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nThis screenshot and output is from v1.52.1 running in a Docker container, but I've also tried the `:beta` tag just to be sure, and it happens exactly the same way there too.\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nDocker running on Arch Linux 64-bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nThe remote I was using to test this was a Google Drive with `crypt` on top.\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nI'm running `rcd --enable-metrics` and then sending it `sync/sync` with `_async=true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nWell, it's an `rc` call so the log from the call itself is not very interesting. I don't have the log for the `rcd` instance itself handy, but I had been monitoring it and it looked like a perfectly normal log output, plenty of \"Copied (new)\" entries for each file. Nothing on the WebUI or the log indicates rclone is doing anything wrong, the metrics just don't reflect reality.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4341/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
