PR introduces the new flag --local-zero-size-links\r\n\r\nAssume the Stat size of links is zero (and read them instead)\r\n\r\nOn some virtual filesystems (such ash LucidLink), reading a link size via a\r\nStat call always returns 0.\r\nHowever, on unix it reads as the length of the text in the link. This may\r\ncause errors like this when syncing:\r\n\r\n    Failed to copy: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 13\r\n\r\nSetting this flag causes rclone to read the link and use that as the size of\r\nthe link instead of 0 which in most cases fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nFixes #4950\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nFix #4950\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue
