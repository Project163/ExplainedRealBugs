listing a webdav (NextCloud) remote I get the following error\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone ls myremote:\r\n2018/07/27 23:44:13 ERROR : : error listing: couldn't list files: parsing time \"\" as \"Mon Jan _2

\"Mon\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried the current release v1.42 and also a build from the current revision 9c90b5e both on Windows 10 with amd64 architecture.\r\nI found out the problem is that I have an external storage configured in NextCloud and the corresponding file entry has no modification time:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <d:response>\r\n    <d:href>/remote.php/webdav/ftp/</d:href>\r\n    <d:propstat>\r\n

Found</d:status>\r\n    </d:propstat>\r\n  </d:response>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug is somewhat related to #1952, however the problem here is not the wrong time format but the missing modification time.\r\nI can confirm that it works with the following dirty hack in UnmarshalXML in webdav/api/types.go\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (v==\"\") {\r\n\t*t = Time(time.Now())\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the proper way of solving this might be evaluating the d:status tag and see if it is OK before parsing the properties.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
