This has many benefits as described by Nick Craig-Wood.\r\n\r\nIt presents an unintended side-effect when you have two+ files with names that are near-identical with the exception of the _similar_ Unicode characters in that name, such as `é` and `é` which evaluate to 0x65+0x301 and 0xE9 respectively.\r\n\r\nIn my use case, I would like rclone to treat these characters as unique, but it does not.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAs Nick said:\r\n> To avoid this we'd need another flag to skip the normalization in the sync routines.\r\n\r\nSo I propose we add a new _Non Backend Flag_ named `--no-unicode-normalization` however this is very similar to the currently deprecated flag named `--local-no-unicode-normalization` and that might add confusion, so I'm curious to hear if anyone thinks the flag should use another name?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
