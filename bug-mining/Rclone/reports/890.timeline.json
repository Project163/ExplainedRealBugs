you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nAdds a configuration option (`azureblob_use_msi`) to use a managed service identity when authenticating to Azure from an Azure virtual machine, which eliminates the need to manage explicit credentials. This method acquires a bearer token (valid for 24 hours) from the [Azure Instance Metadata Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token#get-a-token-using-http), and if a temporary error is returned will retry using the exponential backoff method specified in the linked documentation.\r\n\r\nThe token is not presently persisted to disk; if users are expected to invoke the `rclone` binary a large number of times in a short period that functionality would be desirable. The present implementation also does not check token validity before calling the Azure Storage blob API, so if a `rclone` invocation lasts long enough that it calls the API more than 24 hours after process start that call will fail.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nIssue #3213.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution
