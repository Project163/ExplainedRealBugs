Step 5 in [this](https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id) section says that \"all other data is optional\" so it can be left empty except \"Application name\". But I had to enter user support email and developer contact email too. Screenshot attached below. I ended up giving my own email but I believe this aspect should be documented too. Happy to submit a PR for this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52988856/151710696-b1c38e8c-1d99-48a1-aa7a-edc754bd2559.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nv1.57.0\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nubuntu 20.04 (64 bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
