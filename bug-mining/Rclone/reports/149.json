 I'm using rclone v1.28 on Debian Jessie 64-bits.\nI'm trying to rclone copy using --files-from, something like:\n\nrclone copy -v --config credsfile --files-from=listfiles ./ credname:/test2/\n\nThis is to Google Drive.\n\nrclone procedes to build a (in my case) huge list of files found locally which are \"Excluded from sync (and deletion)\" .\n\nMy expectation would be that rclone simply copies the files listed in the files-from without any other hanky panky.\n\nThanks for a neat-o and fast tool!\n\n.\n./adiabatic_data\n./adiabatic_data/600_20\n./adiabatic_data/600_20/run_53\n./adiabatic_data/600_20/run_53/outFile.txt\n./adiabatic_data/600_20/run_53/output_file.txt\n./adiabatic_data/600_20/run_53/jobScript.py\n./adiabatic_data/600_20/run_53/error_file.txt\n./adiabatic_data/600_20/run_53/jobsubmit\n./adiabatic_data/600_20/run_53/log_file.txt\n2016/03/17
