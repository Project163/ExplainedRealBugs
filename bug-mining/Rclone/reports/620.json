here!\r\n\r\nThanks for this amazing software ✌\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nI would like to get the download link from the remote control API, actually it's not possible, this feature is a remote control implementation of the rclone link command.\r\n\r\nhttps://rclone.org/commands/rclone_link/\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nI think Rclone could add a new endpoint to support it, we can imagine something like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   path: 'gdrive:/myfile.mp4'\r\n   url: 'https://drive.google.com/.../myfile.mp4'\r\n   encrypted_content: false,\r\n   encrypted_title: false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt could also be nice if Rclone could generate links even if the file/title is encrypted, we can imagine 3rd party software to decrypt it.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
