This seems to fail for files that have a & symbol in them.\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\nrclone v1.70.3\n- os/version: arch (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 6.16.1-arch1-1 (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.24.5\n- go/linking: dynamic\n- go/tags: none\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nArch Linux 64bit\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\n\ninternetarchive\n\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\nrclone -P copy ia:item1 ia:item2\n\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\n```2025/08/17 17:10:35 ERROR : Example_&_Example.mp4: Failed to copy: HTTP error 400 (400 Bad Request) returned body: \"<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\\n<Error><Code>InvalidArgument</Code><Message>Invalid Argument</Message><Resource>x-(amz|archive)-copy-source header has bad character, try url escaping: '/ItemTitle/Example_&_Example.mp4'</Resource><RequestId>dc1fd2cd-e6cd-40c2-8b7b-2614b37ed211</RequestId></Error>\"```\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
