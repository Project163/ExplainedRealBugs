is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.51.0\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nI'm trying to match a path/filename not having some substrings in order to discard them on filters.\r\nNow you can match substrings but cannot match strings not having certain substrings.\r\n\r\nRclone is using standard golang regex lib, but it doesn't support features like lookahead assertion (?!) that will allow it.\r\n\r\nHow do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nUsing, optionaly, another regex lib, like https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2 for example.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nEdit : i think the best way to use the regexp2 lib i've linked is with RE2 compatibility mode :
