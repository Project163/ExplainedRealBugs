(e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nMostly related to the protecting the crypt remote key material. For completeness: the backing cloud storage is S3 backed by Ceph.\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n`rclone config --password-command 'zenity --password'`\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a suggested usage, however it shows the problematic behavior nicely.\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024/05/20 15:23:44 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.60.1-DEV\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"-vv\" \"config\" \"--config\" \"configs/cesnet-clean.conf\" \"--password-command\" \"zenity --password\"]\r\n2024/05/20 15:23:44 DEBUG : Using config file from \"/home/joe/Trustica/git/cesnet-crypt/configs/cesnet-clean.conf\"\r\nCurrent remotes:\r\n\r\nName                 Type\r\n====                 ====\r\ncesnet-clean         s3\r\ncesnet-encrypted     crypt\r\n\r\ne) Edit existing remote\r\nn) New remote\r\nd) Delete remote\r\nr) Rename remote\r\nc) Copy remote\r\ns) Set configuration password\r\nq) Quit config\r\ne/n/d/r/c/s/q> \r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
