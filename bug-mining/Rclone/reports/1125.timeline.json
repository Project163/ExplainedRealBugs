However it is useful if you ever want to use rclone in an autofs mount - if you don't use it there then you get an infinite loop.\r\n\r\n@ncw I don't thunk so.\r\n\r\nI have recently run tests with rclone mount and systemd autofs on ubuntu xenial using rclone mount wrapper from https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/rclone-fstab-mount-helper-script\r\n\r\nAll tests were run on Ubuntu Xenial amd64 with latest updates.\r\n\r\nThe test matrix included:\r\n- remote with a file vs empty remote\r\n- fstab with `allow-non-empty` (passed to rclone mount via $trans) vs without this option\r\n- backrounding done using shell's ampersand (`&`) in wrapper vs `rclone mount --daemon ...` without ampersand\r\n- with or without x-systemd.automount in fstab\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n- `--daemon` just hangs, always (must be a flag-related bug in rclone, I added a comment in the wiki)\r\n- empty remote just hangs - obviously due to \"total 0\" loop in wrapper (I added a comment in the wiki)\r\n- `allow-non-empty` does not affect anything in the test; mounts (with or without `x-systemd.automount`) work correctly with or without this

This change removes the close() call from Flush() and replaces it with FlushWrites() so that the file only gets closed when Release() is called. The new FlushWrites method takes care of actually writing the file back to the underlying storage.\r\n\r\nFixes #3381\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3381\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-mount-vfs-cache-doesnt-appear-to-handle-dup-calls-gracefully/11030\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/542871180","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3562#issuecomment-542871180","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3562","id":542871180,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0Mjg3MTE4MA==","user":{"login":"mbc0","id":19304467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzA0NDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19304467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0","html_url":"https://github.com/mbc0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbc0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-16T20:10:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T13:59:40Z","body":"Hi, I had this working for ages but now the message contradicts itself! it says to use nonempty then when I do it tells me it is unknown? can somebody please explain what I can do to get this to work again?
