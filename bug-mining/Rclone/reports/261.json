Copying to localhost exports the documents fine, but when using the \"sync\" command to sync back the local dir to drive, rclone will report an error: \"Can't delete google document\". (As the local copy doesn't have the native google docs of course, only the exported files.)\r\n\r\nNow, I'm happy with the result, as I'm fine with keeping my google docs on drive in their native format, and a local export won't hurt. But I don't like to rely on an error so that my google docs on drive won't get deleted someday.\r\n\r\nCan you implement a \"skip google docs\" switch so that google docs are excluded altogether when the switch is used?\r\n\r\n_Using rclone 1.34 on Linux Mint 64bit._","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1035/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1035/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
