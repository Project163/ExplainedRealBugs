you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the changes here\r\n-->\r\nWhen using the [:backend:](https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir) syntax for creating remote on the fly, the cache will try to create a directory with name \":backend\", which contains illegal character in Windows.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone mount :webdav: Z: --fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\\server\\home --vfs-cache-mode writes --webdav-url https://live.sysinternals.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fix will trim off the leading \":\".\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround:\r\nSet environment variable `RCLONE_CONFIG_name_TYPE=backend`, which will create an actual remote with specified name, and then use \"name:\" as the remote.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=webdav&&rclone mount myremote: Z: --fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\\server\\home --vfs-cache-mode writes --webdav-url https://live.sysinternals.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note/question:**\r\n\r\nAfter this fix, using the example above, if you create another mount using \":webdav:\", but a completely different server (--webdav-url), it will end up using the same cache directory. This could potentially lead to issues, I think? If, for some reason, the first mount were shut down - but did not manage to upload all changes. When you create the second, different, mount it will start uploading from the previous cache, will it not? Should this be warned about? Either as an message (Error? Notice?) from the place in code where I did a change, and/or in the documentation?\r\n\r\nActually, you have potentially the same risk with regular remotes as well: If you create a remote with name \"mycloud\", then same as before: Shut it down in a way that leaves pending uploads. Then delete the remote from configuration and create a different one using the same name. Next time you mount the new remote it will pick up the existing cache, and start uploading.\r\n\r\nThe second case is probably not *that* likely to happen, but I think it deserves a little warning in the documentation?\r\nUsing the workaround will be the same case, if you dont use the same name for different remotes you are fine, but perhaps a bit more likely that you will use the same name now, since the remote name are just temporary.\r\nThe first case is even more likely to happen, as all you have to do is to use the \"on the fly\" remote functionality with several of the same backend types (assuming the case of pending uploads after shutdown is something that may occur now and then).\r\n\r\n**Edit: Thinking about possible solutions..**\r\n- Could there be a config flag of some kind, that are set first time a remote is used - or at least when it creates its cache for the first time? So that when this flag is not set on startup, rclone would exit with fatal if cache directory already exists. On later startups it would accept that it does not exist.\r\n- I was also thinking about making cache location configurable per remote, independent of each other. Maybe this could be combined: If cache location is configured then any existing location on first startup is used as is, user's responsibility. If cache location is not configured on first startup then rclone builds a default path - and now checks it does not exist, and then stores this in config. Downside is that you cannot easily relocate the entire cache by just setting --cache-dir, this would then just change the default for any future remotes, since existing remotes have their cache path stored... That could be a big downside, so would probably need to do something more/else.. \r\n\r\n**Edit: From the issue #4544:**\r\n\r\n> Though it might be better to substitute the : with a character that can't appear in remote names but can appear in Windows file names rather than removing it, say =\r\n\r\nI have not done this, just removed the \":\" prefix (which by the way, should only be possible with this special \"on the fly\" remotes, and then there should always be exactly one occurence - at index 0, since `Remote names may only contain 0-9, A-Z ,a-z ,_ , - and space`, quote from https://rclone.org/docs/#valid-remote-names). By just using the backend name, as I have done, there is an additional risk of name clash if user configures a remote with the same name as the backend type (for instance configures a remote of type \"webdav\" and gives it name \"webdav\" also). Could add a character as suggested to avoid this (but perhaps append it to the end instead, to get more natural sort order?), but will wait for a decision regarding my additional concerns above, in case this leads to a more thorough fix that handles all cases.\r\n \r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-one-liner-to-connect-a-webdav-mount-without-rclone-conf/20444\r\n\r\nEdit: Got a tip that there was actually an issue for this as well - this will fix #4544\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [ ] I have added
