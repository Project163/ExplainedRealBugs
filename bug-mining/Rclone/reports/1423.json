It requires MEGA client software to solve a complicated mathematical equation during each login attempt.\n  This will significantly increase the cost for attackers attempting mass-scale unauthorized access to MEGA accounts, protecting you from unauthorised logins by malicious attackers who used to try hundreds of millions of passwords every day.\n  Outdated official MEGA clients and most third-party tools, including those using the MEGA API, do not currently support solving this mathematical equation and may encounter issues such as the \"402 Payment Required\" error.\n  This error does not indicate a problem with your subscription or payment status; instead, it is a response indicating that the login attempt could not fulfil the computational requirement.\n  To continue using the MEGA API, please log in using an updated MEGA client, such as your web browser in incognito mode.\n  Once logged in successfully, please use the API again within 24 hours.\n  Kind regards,\n  MEGA Support\n\nI've tried following these recommendations but issue persists\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\n```\nrclone v1.70.3\n- os/version: arch (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 6.12.39-1-lts (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.24.5\n- go/linking: dynamic\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nLinux 64\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
