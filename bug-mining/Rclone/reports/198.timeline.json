Using 'hubicfuse' the performance is similar to svfs.\n\nAlso tried using the \"mount\" mode of rclone, same problem, listing a single directory with 7-10 files can take up to several minutes -- even with the \"--no-modtime\" option.\n\nI hoped to use rclone because I have some reliability issues with the tools which mount FUSE FS, but why is it so slow? This is basically unusable, sync will take forever (killed it after 50 minutes, whereas my normal rsync to svfs or hubicfuse completes in less than 30) and of course it doesn't cache the dir structure locally between runs.  Is there any way to speed it up? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/245644748","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/703#issuecomment-245644748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/703","id":245644748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTY0NDc0OA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T15:54:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T15:54:11Z","body":"I've fixed this with this beta: http://pub.rclone.org/v1.33-11-g346d4c5%CE%B2/\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/245644748/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":782618532,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzgyNjE4NTMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/782618532","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"346d4c587cc8e6c426f599715cb6483b727fe32c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/346d4c587cc8e6c426f599715cb6483b727fe32c","created_at":"2016-09-08T15:54:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
