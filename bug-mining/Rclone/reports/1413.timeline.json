very large listings in s3 in particular can run for a long time and rclone never reports any progress.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add an additional interface `ListP` (for list paged) which has a similar interface to `ListR`.\r\n\r\nThis would enable `Listing` stats to be counted.\r\n\r\nIt would also enable a low memory sync where we don't load the whole directory listing into memory first.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two listing interfaces\r\n\r\nOne which looks like this `ListR`\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// ListRCallback defines a callback function for ListR to use\r\n//\r\n// It is called for each tranche of entries read from the listing and\r\n// if it returns an error, the listing stops.\r\ntype ListRCallback func(entries DirEntries) error\r\n\r\n// ListRFn is defines the call used to recursively list a directory\r\ntype ListRFn func(ctx context.Context, dir string, callback ListRCallback) error\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the other `List` which looks like\r\n\r\n```go\r\n        // List the objects and directories in dir into entries.  The\r\n        // entries can be returned in any order but should be for a\r\n        // complete directory.\r\n        //\r\n        // dir should be \"\" to list the root, and should not have\r\n        // trailing slashes.\r\n        //\r\n        // This should return ErrDirNotFound if the directory isn't\r\n        // found.\r\n        List(ctx context.Context, dir string) (entries DirEntries, err error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the ideal solution to this would be to change the List interface into something more like the ListR interface.\r\n\r\nIt would then be easy to create a shim function with worked the same as List and counted stats.\r\n\r\nChanging the List interface for **every** backend is a lot of work though which is why I haven't done it previously (though it has occurred to me!).\r\n\r\nIt might be that having an optional interface say `ListP` for `List` paged might be the way to go.  Not all backends are capable of \"paging\" a listing of a single directory.\r\n\r\nFrom:
