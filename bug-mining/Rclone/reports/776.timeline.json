sorry for removing the previous comment I accidentally posted some personal info which I needed to remove.\r\n\r\n> Would you like to open a PR for this?\r\n\r\nWell I can remove `s` but I don't think that is sufficient, because it may need some function to catch the `id`, I don't know golang (although I am learning).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Original comment:** @ncw I finally debugged it.\r\n\r\nWhen we config rclone and choose `OneDrive Personal or Business`, rclone send request to `/me/drives` endpoint. However the `/me/drives` endpoint returns the following response:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"@odata.context\": \"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#drives\",\r\n    \"value\": [\r\n        {\r\n
