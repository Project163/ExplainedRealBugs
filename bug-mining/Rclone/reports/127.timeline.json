The \"--no-gzip-encoding\" option makes the hard errors (\"Failed to copy: Object Corrupted\") disappear and so data is synced then but the problem is that the \"Content-Encoding\" meta-data is not preserved for the destination object.\n\nSo after sync, I have a gzip compressed file in the destination container that is not marked as gzip compressed (there's no \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" header on the destination object). Therefore, downloading the synced object from the destination fails (or rather, you get a still compressed, binary body with \"Content-Type: text/xml\").\n\nIdeally, rclone should also copy the object's meta-data from source to destination so to preserve the \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" header. \n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/249659855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmilitzer","id":16718288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzE4Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16718288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/mmilitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmilitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
