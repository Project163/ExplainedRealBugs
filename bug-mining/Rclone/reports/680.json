From the log I can see there is some issue with \"urn:microsoft.com:service:X_MS_MediaReceiverRegistrar:1RegisterDevice\" SOAP header causing my radio not to connect to the server.\r\nSeems to be the same issue as reported to MiniDLNA here: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/minidlna/+bug/1231886](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/minidlna/+bug/1231886)\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.49.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/arm\r\n- go version: go1.12.9\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nRaspbian, 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
