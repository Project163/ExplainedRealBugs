What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nWhen every source object already exists at the destination and `--no-traverse` is set, march stalled/deadlocked after 100 entries because dstChan lagged srcChan. Introduced in v1.70.0 with callback-based syncing.\r\n\r\nWork-around by buffering all sources and destinations then replaying through balanced channels.\r\n\r\nThis fix is naive and regresses on the intent of the new algorithm, but gets things working again. There's probably a more sophisticated approach that preserves streaming and global ordering without stalls, e.g. using an intermediary goroutine to track latest \"frontier\" key for each worker, then only emitting keys to dstChan that are less than the smallest of all frontier keys.\r\n\r\nI couldn't get a test case working reliably, but here's a script to reproduce:\r\n```bash\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n# Reproduces rclone v1.70+ deadlock with --no-traverse when all files exist\r\n# Usage: ./repro.sh [rclone-binary-path]\r\n\r\n# Use provided rclone binary or default to system rclone\r\nRCLONE=\"${1:-rclone}\"\r\n\r\necho \"Using rclone: $RCLONE\"\r\necho \"Version: $($RCLONE version | head -1)\"\r\necho\r\n\r\n# Create test directories\r\nsrc=$(mktemp -d)\r\ndst=$(mktemp -d)\r\n\r\n# Create 200 test files (enough to trigger the ~100 file deadlock)\r\necho \"Creating 200 test files...\"\r\nfor i in {1..200}; do\r\n    echo \"content$i\" > \"$src/file$i.txt\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Initial copy to establish destination\r\necho \"Initial copy to destination...\"\r\n$RCLONE copy \"$src/\" \"$dst/\" --quiet\r\n\r\n# Create file list\r\nfilelist=$(mktemp)\r\nls \"$src\" > \"$filelist\"\r\n\r\n# This command deadlocks in v1.70+ when all files exist at destination\r\necho \"Testing --no-traverse with all files existing (10s timeout)...\"\r\ntimeout 10s $RCLONE copy \"$src/\" \"$dst/\" \\\r\n    --no-traverse \\\r\n    --files-from \"$filelist\" \\\r\n    --ignore-existing \\\r\n    --progress\r\n\r\nif [ $? -eq 124 ]; then\r\n    echo -e \"\\n❌ FAIL: Command timed out (deadlock detected)\"\r\n    exit 1\r\nelse\r\n    echo -e \"\\n✅ PASS: Command completed successfully\"\r\nfi\r\n\r\n# Cleanup\r\nrm -rf \"$src\" \"$dst\" \"$filelist\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults on 1.69.3, 1.70.2, and with this patch:\r\n```bash\r\nUsing rclone: rclone\r\nVersion: rclone v1.69.3\r\n\r\nCreating 200 test files...\r\nInitial copy to
