almost. What I'm thinking about here is the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. The date T of the last sync was recorded at the target side.\r\n2. Some files changed in between.\r\n3. The next sync will overwrite or delete those files (even in case the `--update` option was set, there is still a risk of both destructive operations).\r\n4. So I create an exclusion filter to exclude every local file that was updated after T and run the sync.\r\n\r\nNow, what I propose is to add an option to avoid modifying files that changed at the target side after T. There is already an option to avoid transferring files that are too new, but that's not exactly the same. And I think the use case is compelling enough that a special flag might be preferable over a list of excluded files.
