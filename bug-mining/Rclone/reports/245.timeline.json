configured 2 remotes, one for hubic and another one for google drive.\nWhat's happening is, everything works fine for a while but for instance, the next day my backup script didn't back it up to google drive... and when I check, the \"google\" remote is gone from rclone config.\n\nThis happened a few times already, is it that the google drive remote expires and then it's removed from my list of remotes? I noticed hubic is still there, only the google remote is gone.\n\nI have removed the hubic remote and left only the google drive active.\nI have also added a password to protect the configuration, so let's see if it disappears this way.\n\nI am the only person with access to the server, a debian jessie server.\n\nAny idea how come only the google drive remote disappears?\nAnywhere I can debug rclone to find out why it disappears?\n\nThanks\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":847733973,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDg0NzczMzk3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/847733973","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-04T11:05:50Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.35"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":847733974,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50ODQ3NzMzOTc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/847733974","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-04T11:05:50Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.34"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-24T21:31:26Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T21:31:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/908","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/908/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/908/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/908/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/908","id":191573850,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTE1NzM4NTA=","number":908,"title":"rclone
