is now done.  Please see this beta\r\n\r\nhttp://beta.rclone.org/v1.35-13-ge1a49ca/ (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nHere are notes from the docs\r\n\r\nEnvironment Variables\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nRclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.  These\r\ncan be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.\r\n\r\n### Options ###\r\n\r\nEvery option in rclone can have its default set by environment\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nTo find the name of the environment variable, first take the long\r\noption name, strip the leading `--`, change `-` to `_`, make\r\nupper case and prepend `RCLONE_`.\r\n\r\nFor example to always set `--stats 5s`, set the environment variable\r\n`RCLONE_STATS=5s`.  If you set stats on the command line this will\r\noverride the environment variable setting.\r\n\r\nOr to always use the trash in drive `--drive-use-trash`, set\r\n`RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true`.\r\n\r\nThe same parser is used for the options and the environment variables\r\nso they take exactly the same form.\r\n\r\n### Config file ###\r\n\r\nYou can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual\r\nremote basis.  If you want to use this feature, you will need to\r\ndiscover the name of the config items that you want.  The easiest way\r\nis to run through `rclone config` by hand, then look in the config\r\nfile to see what the values are (the config file can be found by\r\nlooking at the help for `--config` in `rclone help`).\r\n\r\nTo find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take\r\n`RCLONE_` + name of remote + `_` + name of config file option and make\r\nit all uppercase.\r\n\r\nFor example to configure an S3 remote named `mys3:` without a config\r\nfile (using unix ways of setting environment variables):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3\r\n$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX\r\n$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX\r\n$ rclone lsd MYS3:\r\n          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket\r\n$ rclone listremotes | grep mys3\r\nmys3:\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that if you want to create a remote using environment variables\r\nyou must create the `..._TYPE` variable as above.\r\n\r\n### Other environment variables ###\r\n\r\n  * RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` set to contain your config file password (see [Configuration Encryption](#configuration-encryption) section)\r\n  * HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions thereof).\r\n    * HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https requests.\r\n    * The environment values may be either a complete URL or a \"host[:port]\" for, in which case the \"http\" scheme is

Request:\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice to be able to do scripted installs / configs for use in containers.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nOn container init:\r\n```\r\nrclone config --interactive httpd --httpdPort 12345 --httpdRedirectOnDone {{IP}}:54321 --confoption NAME=ACD --confoption TYPE=ACD --confoption CLIENT_ID=value --confoption CLIENT_SECRET=value --confoption WHATEVER=value && \\\r\nrclone config --interactive httpd --httpdPort 54321 --confoption TYPE=crypt --confoption REMOTE=ACD:Vault --confoption FILENAME_ENCRYPTION=standard && \\\r\nmkdir /mnt/ACD_CRYPT && rclone mount ACD_CRYPT: /mnt/ACD_CRYPT &\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically rather than provide CLI input, have the command launch the built in HTTP server that already exists, and wait for the needed input by the command. The individual commands can take the options provided and present back the HTTP server which options they still need filled in (dynamic input). Once submitted, the redirect kicks in and sends it to the next port / command (or something like that).\r\n\r\nI'm going to start working on a small node.js service to manually build the rclone.conf in this manner, but I'd much rather it be handled natively. Right now I see now way to do remotely attended installs without the command line input.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1010/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-13T15:52:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-13T15:52:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/554","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/554/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/554/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/554/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/554","id":163227759,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNjMyMjc3NTk=","number":554,"title":"Ability
