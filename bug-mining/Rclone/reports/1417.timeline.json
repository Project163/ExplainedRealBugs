There are two listing processes running one for the source and one for the destination and they appear to have deadlocked here\n\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/c639d3656e76357b5aba727ef6d2f47704a639cb/fs/march/march.go#L395\n\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/c639d3656e76357b5aba727ef6d2f47704a639cb/fs/march/march.go#L412\n\nSo whatever is supposed to be reading from those channels is not reading them.\n\nI see these two lines in the trace\n\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/c639d3656e76357b5aba727ef6d2f47704a639cb/fs/march/march.go#L314\n\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/c639d3656e76357b5aba727ef6d2f47704a639cb/fs/march/march.go#L318\n\nThere is no HTTP activity (or any other kind of activity other than waiting for locks or channels) in the backtrace so we aren't waiting for either of the backends to return a directory listing.\n\nIt really looks like a deadlock :-(\n\nThere are 8 copies of `matchListings` runnings (which is correct according to your `--checkers` which is at the default of `8`). Each of these is checking a different directory, but two have deadlocked in exactly the same way which is surprising.\n\nThe last deadlock started 34 minutes before you killed rclone which is about the time of this log\n\n```\nDEBUG : PATH/TO/YET/ANOTHER/FILE: Sizes identical\nDEBUG : PATH/TO/FILE/AGAIN: Unchanged skipping\nDEBUG : PATH/TO/LAST/FILE/CHECKED: Unchanged skipping\n```\n\nWhich are the last files transferred. It is as if rclone didn't notice the listings had finished for some reason.\n\nCan you try some tests for me?\n\nIf you do\n\n```\nrclone lsf -R SWIFT:BUCKETNAME > src.list\nrclone lsf -R AWSS3:BUCKETNAME/PATH/ > dst.list\n```\n\nDo they complete successfully?\n\nI'd love to have `src.list` and `dst.list` - you can send them to me privately at info@rclone.com (put a link to the issue in the email) but I understand if your company does not allow this.\n\nIs the bug reproducible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3279764791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19642069047,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M7K2rAnzwAAAASSwjA3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19642069047","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"35beae91a234faddbf16a0da83524b2bb48cfcb5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/35beae91a234faddbf16a0da83524b2bb48cfcb5","created_at":"2025-09-11T16:29:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3281773079","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8811#issuecomment-3281773079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8811","id":3281773079,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M7Dm-IX","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-11T16:32:03Z","updated_at":"2025-09-11T16:32:03Z","body":"I had an idea on how to fix this.
