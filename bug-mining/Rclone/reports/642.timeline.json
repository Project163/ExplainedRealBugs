 1.

`rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.47.0\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nI help other people create tasks via scripts but would also like the configuration encryption done without going through the interactive menu.  \r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nTo encrypt:\r\nrclone config encrypt \"mypassword\" or without the \"mypassword\" and directly retrieve RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS.\r\nTo decrypt:\r\nrclone config encrypt \"\"\r\nand then complete the rclone task with --ask-password=false and setting RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael

What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nI'm installing rclone into a container with vagrant. \r\n- Fresh installation of Debian Stretch with Vagrant\r\n- Run rclone install script: `curl

rclone v1.59.1\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a `--config-command` as analogues to the `--password-command` so we can source our own encryption calls for the config file, or provide our own master encryption key (**not** password) to supplement in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/f0e439de0df77b6ceee197d62f51b47455fe8a3a/fs/config/config.go#L80\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/f0e439de0df77b6ceee197d62f51b47455fe8a3a/fs/config/config.go#L275\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful when we have devices which have their own hardware-backed keystore, such as smartphones. I am [currently](https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/550) implementing in Termux the ability to encrypt and decrypt using AES in Android's keystore. The problem with the current method is that I would still need to include the encrypted master password somewhere (such as in a file or sharedpreferences), but it would be preferable if I could source the master key directly from the keystore, or call a command to provide the decrypted config, therefore making sure the password isn't stored anywhere feasibly accessible on the device (even in encrypted form), nor in memory/cache.\r\n\r\nAndroid's keystore supports biometric and pattern authentication and can be unlocked for a certain duration, only when the device is unlocked, for x times, et cetera, so the security of the config file would be greater and never expose the key (encrypted or unencrypted) outside the call.\r\n\r\nIt would be something like [connection strings](https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings), having no persistent configuration data, but maintaining the convenience of not having to manually input the configuration details and not having the command show up in logs, buffer history, et cetera","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
