Thank you for this suggestion but unfortunately it also does not work.  It is possibly a step in the right direction, though, since drives mounted with EncfsMP are considered to be local drives and not removable storage.\n\nAlso, [EncfsMP does not support the `--reverse` option](http://sourceforge.net/p/encfsmp/tickets/2/), which would break the current backup workflow I'm using.\n\nMy current workaround is to share the folders over smb then run encfs and rclone from a linux VM.\n\nThanks\n![disks](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4510602/12075915/5f8a127e-b147-11e5-8bc6-14357b8c2e44.PNG)\n![encfsmp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4510602/12075916/5f9157aa-b147-11e5-8594-3f41f2050b49.PNG)\n![rclone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4510602/12075917/5f977e1e-b147-11e5-8e70-6ec59480007e.PNG)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/168422774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"garypaduana","id":4510602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTA2MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4510602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana","html_url":"https://github.com/garypaduana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garypaduana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":504032282,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTA0MDMyMjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/504032282","actor":{"login":"klauspost","id":5663952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjM5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5663952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost","html_url":"https://github.com/klauspost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-02T19:53:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":504032283,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUwNDAzMjI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/504032283","actor":{"login":"klauspost","id":5663952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjM5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5663952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost","html_url":"https://github.com/klauspost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-02T19:53:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/168426599","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/261#issuecomment-168426599","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/261","id":168426599,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODQyNjU5OQ==","user":{"login":"klauspost","id":5663952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjM5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5663952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost","html_url":"https://github.com/klauspost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users

I tried to use the fix this morning but unfortunately it doesn't seem to have worked.  As you can see it is no longer using the UNC path but still cannot find the path specified in the encfs drive.  \n\nI'm able to access the mounted drive with every other software I frequently use (SyncBackPro, Amazon Cloud Drive Official Client, VLC, Filezilla FTP Server, SMB shares, various image viewers, 7zip, Search Everything, and so on).  Is there anything else you'd like me to try?\n\nThank you for your continued effort but if you want to put this on hold I understand.\n\nDoes the additional colon at the end of the path have anything to do with this? e.g. `N:\\:`\n\n```\nN:\\>rclone ls .\n2016/01/05 15:04:25 Local file system at N:\\: Failed to open directory: N:\\: Readdir N:\\: The system cannot find the path
