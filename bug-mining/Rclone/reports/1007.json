However when needing to bulk touch files in a directory this is only possible by first fetching all the files contained with the directory and any subdirectories and then touch each file one at a time, this is very time consuming and as a result `rclone touch` would benefit of being able to recursively touch all files within a directory.\r\n\r\nWhen using rclone touch with the new `--recursive` flag it should only touch already existing files, and should not create new files by default.","closed_by":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5301/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
