What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.52.0\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.14.3\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-check-should-respect-dry-run/17000\r\n find that working with filters is complex and takes a few tests to get it correct.\r\nwhen setting up a sync, and using filters, i can use --dry-run to make sure i got the filter flags correct.\r\nbut not with check, to make sure that the filter flags are correct.\r\n\r\ncheck can take many,many hours to complete, given only one check can be done at a time.\r\nso i need to know upfront that the check and filter flags are correct.\r\nall the more so, when using --download\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nrclone check should be able to do more than one check as a time, using --checkers\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
