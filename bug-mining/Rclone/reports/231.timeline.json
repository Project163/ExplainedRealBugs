In Perl, something akin to 's/\\r/\\r/' and 's/\\n/\\n/'.

Sorry, I was confused by the version numbering. I'm used to a version 1.34betaBlah being a beta prior to 1.34, rather than a new build based off 1.34 (which appears to be how it's used here). So for instance, I thought v1.34-03-g34e7ca9 was a beta prior to 1.34, rather than between 1.34 and 1.35. Am I understanding things properly now? :)\r\n\r\nIf things are still in the state of the last beta I saw, then you run into the excessive escaping described previously.

I fixed it; take a look again to see all the spurious backslashes on quotation marks.)\r\n\r\nSimilar issue (external data including spurious linefeeds) - I've been seeing raw HTML error pages show up in the verbose output. For instance:\r\n\r\namazon drive root 'folder': Directory listing error for \"folder2/\": HTTP code 502: \"502 Bad Gateway\", reponse body: `<html>`\r\n`<head>`\r\n`<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />`\r\n`<title>We're sorry!</title>`\r\n`</head>`\r\n`<body style=\"padding: 4em; color: black; background-color: white; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">`\r\n`<h2>We're sorry!</h2>`\r\n`<p>`\r\n`An error occurred when we tried to process your request.`\r\n`Rest assured, we're already working on the problem and expect to resolve it shortly.`\r\n`</p>`\r\n`<h2>Désolés!</h2>`\r\n`<p>`\r\n`Une erreur s'est produite lorsque nous avons tenté de traiter votre requête.`\r\n`Soyez assuré que nous travaillons déjà à la résolution du problème que nous pensons trouver très rapidement.`\r\n`</p>`\r\n`</body>`\r\n`</html>`\r\n\r\nThis also means my original solution of using Trim was naive as it would only handle the case of a trailing linefeed, but not a response body with linefeeds all over the place (such as in HTML). Escaping in some fashion is definitely the way to go; just make sure you're not double-escaping (such as the `\\\"` in my previous comment).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/263887542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"diamondsw","id":49737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw","html_url":"https://github.com/diamondsw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondsw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
