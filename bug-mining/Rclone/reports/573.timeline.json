There have been quite a few VFS fixes since 1.45.\r\n\r\nIs this a repeatable problem?\r\n\r\nHow did you replicate it - just with the rename?\r\n\r\nIs your config just a google drive?

Maybe the `<nil>` got eaten somewhere as it looks like it did in a different log.\r\n\r\nWhat it looks like is that in this code `operations.Move` returned a `nil` object, which most likely was returned by the drive backend server side move code\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\trenameCall := func() error {\r\n\t\tnewPath := path.Join(destDir.path, newName)\r\n\t\tdstOverwritten, _ := f.d.f.NewObject(newPath)\r\n\t\tnewObject, err := operations.Move(f.d.f, dstOverwritten, newPath, f.o)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\tfs.Errorf(f.Path(), \"File.Rename error: %v\", err)\r\n\t\t\treturn err\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t// Update the node with the new details\r\n\t\tfs.Debugf(f.o, \"Updating file with %v %p\", newObject, f) // Media/01 - 1080p.mkv: Updating file with 0xc0003af400\r\n\t\t// f.rename(destDir, newObject)\r\n\t\tf.mu.Lock()\r\n\t\tf.o = newObject\r\n\t\tf.d = destDir\r\n\t\tf.leaf = path.Base(newObject.Remote()) // PANIC - newObject nil here?????\r\n\t\tf.pendingRenameFun = nil\r\n\t\tf.mu.Unlock()\r\n\t\treturn nil\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you can replicate this easily, can you try with `-vv --dump bodies`.

I see the problem.  You've written `-no-modtime` (one dash) instead of `--no-modtime` (two dashes).  This means that rclone is intepreting this as combined single letter flags `-n`, `-o '-modtime'`.  `-n` being `--dry-run` and `-o` being a fuse option.\r\n\r\nIf you use `--no-modtime` instead, I
