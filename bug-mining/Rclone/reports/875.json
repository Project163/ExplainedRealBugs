This is an updated post from slack a couple weeks ago.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of S3 buckets with hundred thousands of objects each and I'm syncing them to a local server on daily basis. I have been using `aws s3 sync` for a couple of years and in the last few months, I moved to `rclone` to improve sync reliability. This switch came with a noticeable bump in my bill. After breaking down the costs, each daily sync session is costing an average of 10$:\r\n- 6 million HeadObject (2$)\r\n- 1.2 million ListBucket (8$)\r\n- 3.5 thousand GetObject(<0.01$)\r\n\r\nFrom what I noticed, `rclone` is quite aggressive on ListBucket and HeadObject operations. Is there a way to tune down this behaviour through the configuration?\r\n\r\nHere's some setup information:\r\n```bash\r\n$rclone version\r\nrclone v1.44\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.1\r\n```\r\nThe commands I'm using look like this: `rclone sync s3://bucket /s3/bucket --verbose`","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
