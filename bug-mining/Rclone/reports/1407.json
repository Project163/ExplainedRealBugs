But as soon as I add given CA certificate to `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` and run `update-ca-certificates` everything works OK.\r\n\r\nMy main usecase is that I want to expose FTPS server as SFTP server via Rclone. I'm using `--auth-proxy`. Ideal solution for me would be if I could specify `--ca-cert` dynamically from auth proxy. Would that be possible?\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n`1.61.1`\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\n`Ubuntu 20.04, 64bit`\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
