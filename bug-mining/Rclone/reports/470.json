Mega has implemented some sort of a cache system that returns old results and changes to those results.\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported to Mega and this was the response from Mathias Ortmann at Mega:\r\n\r\n> Okay, we have solved the mystery:\r\n> \r\n> rclone and megatools are not using our SDK. Therefore, they are unable to\r\n> receive updates to the account state.\r\n> \r\n> What we do on our side to reduce loading times for properly implemented\r\n> clients is to take snapshots of accounts that have exceeded a certain\r\n> threshold size (such as yours). When you log in, you get that snapshot\r\n> (which is very fast) plus the delta updates that have happened since\r\n> the snapshot was taken (which is also very fast). Your client is then\r\n> supposed to apply those delta updates to get a correct view of the\r\n> remote state. If the client fails to do so, the view remains outdated.\r\n> \r\n> We could now simply send rclone a freshly generated copy of your account\r\n> state every time it asks. However, if the account is large, this will\r\n> take a while and, worse, cause infrastructure load at our end that we\r\n> are keen to avoid.\r\n> \r\n> Furthermore, we don’t really see rclone as particularly useful if it\r\n> doesn’t get updates in real time, but has to poll for it?\r\n> \r\n> We strongly urge the authors of rclone to do things properly. Our SDK\r\n> hides all the complexity in relation to delta update processing and\r\n> gives the app developer convenient notifications of actual state\r\n> notifications at a fairly high level of abstraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\nrclone v1.42\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.10.3\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nMac OSX 10.13.4\r\nand Debian 9\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
