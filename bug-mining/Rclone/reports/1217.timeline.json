:-)\r\n\r\nSo you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/possible-listr-support-for-onedrive-sharepoint/41832/4?u=jcastill\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n1.64.0\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nCurrently OneDrive does not support ListR, yet it seems that implementing delta (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/concepts/scan-guidance?view=odsp-graph-online) would allow for ListR to be functional on the remote. This would help a lot specially as Microsoft is very conservative on TPSLimit before throttling so a list command of a large folder structure can easily trigger a throttle event.\r\n\r\nSeems delta also supports single files/sub folders so it does not need to always scan the whole drive (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-delta?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThis can be used when --fast-list is invoked to scan the whole subfolder in less API calls in lieu of using more RAM. This can also be used for polling once a scan is completed, not sure if it would only work if initial scan is used by delta, in which case it might make sense to make it default for the remote as it's part of Microsoft API best practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add. It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\r\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11063327790,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M5zmhYezwAAAAKTbPwu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/11063327790","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"74d5477fadfdd9f309d242894f39f6fa332b523f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/74d5477fadfdd9f309d242894f39f6fa332b523f","created_at":"2023-11-26T16:08:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1826840641","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7362#issuecomment-1826840641","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7362","id":1826840641,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5s42BB","user":{"login":"kapitainsky","id":15635386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM1Mzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15635386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky","html_url":"https://github.com/kapitainsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-26T17:22:26Z","updated_at":"2023-11-26T17:22:26Z","body":"> I have added a `--onedrive-delta` flag as suggested which will default to off.
