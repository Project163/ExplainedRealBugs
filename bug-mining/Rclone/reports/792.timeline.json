If we enable fast list only when all upstreams support fast list, it would be a pity for local+remote case. However, if we enable it when one of the upstreams support, it would create unnecessary requests to the unsupported upstream and possibly damage the performance.\r\n\r\nI could make a compromise, enable fast list if all upstreams are in one of these cases:\r\n - fast list supported\r\n - local\r\n - ram\r\nWhat do you think @ncw?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/626506934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Max-Sum","id":4883681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODM2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4883681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum","html_url":"https://github.com/Max-Sum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Max-Sum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3321508167,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMyMTUwODE2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3321508167","actor":{"login":"rsierra","id":7222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra","html_url":"https://github.com/rsierra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsierra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-11T06:49:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
