- Tim Watts from Kings College (University of) London here.\n\nReally really like rclone - it's a nice \"unix way\" implementation. Pity about the Google Docs lack of support. My opinion for what it's worth:\n\n1) I suggest to pick an export format, any format and run with that as soon as possible. That should at least solve 90% of the use cases (I want to back up my Drive etc).\n\n2) Perhaps adding a config option later to choose a preferred format would be very neat, but I suspect most people would be happy to have something by way of a backup. eg a manual Download bundles a zip with MS compatible files - this is sensible. Open Office format (their terminology) would also be perfectly sensible (as anyone can make use of those files if needs must).\n\nI am not sure how to handle the sync-right followed by sync-left problem (converting file formats to and from a foreign format is bound to break any attempt to checksum) but having a good one way copy would be most awesome!\n\nBad form on Google IMHO - if they'd made their Drive interface orthogonal, then the action of getting a Google Doc would cause a transparent export to at least a default format and the action of putting it would do the same as \"Upload\" in the web interface (which is a preference to auto convert or not).\n\nAll the best and good luck :)\n\nTim\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/173247262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TimJWatts","id":4126880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjY4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4126880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts","html_url":"https://github.com/TimJWatts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimJWatts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/176635229","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/49#issuecomment-176635229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/49","id":176635229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjYzNTIyOQ==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-29T08:18:21Z","updated_at":"2016-01-29T08:18:21Z","body":"Thanks @TimJWatts for getting me out of analysis paralysis!

When rclone\ndownloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download depending upon\nthis setting.\n\nBy default the formats are `docx,xlsx,pptx,svg` which are a sensible\ndefault for an editable document.\n\nWhen choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order\nand chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the\nlist. If the file can't be exported to a format on the formats list,\nthen rclone will choose a format from the default list.\n\nIf you prefer an archive copy then you might use `--drive-formats\npdf`, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use\n`--drive-formats ods,odt`.\n\nNote that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is\ncalles `My Spreadsheet` on google docs, it will be exported as `My\nSpreadsheet.xlsx` or `My Spreadsheet.pdf` etc.\n\nHere are the possible extensions with their corresponding mime types.\n\n| Extension | Mime Type | Description |\n| --- | ---
