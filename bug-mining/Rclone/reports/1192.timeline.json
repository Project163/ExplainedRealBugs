But google takes email to impersonate and box takes id like 1234567 to impersonate. Both of which can be found in the user listing APIs respectively. So I think rclone does not need to look for id-from-email or email-from-id. It should only accept id for box and email for google drive. \r\nPS: These are the only two currently I have worked with.  If I missed something please correct me.
