I've been using it to make offsite backups of my data to Microsoft OneDrive, and I noticed filenames with plus signs (+) were returning `File not in Local file system at /home/devin/d/data` in my logs. It appears rclone is replacing \"+\" with spaces (`tes+t.txt` becomes `tes t.txt`), and failing to copy filenames that start with \"+\" (`+test.txt` fails to copy). I'm pretty sure \"+\" is a valid character in both Windows and Linux, and I had no trouble copying the same files to OneDrive manually. I also tried syncing with rclone to Google Drive, and did not have this issue.\n\nUsing a dummy folder ~/tmp, I collected the following info:\n- Version: rclone v1.32\n- OS: Windows 10 x64 and Ubuntu 16.04 x64\n- Destination: Microsoft OneDrive (Google Drive works as expected)\n- Commands: `rclone sync \"/home/me/tmp\" \"onedrive:tmp\" -v --retries 1` and `rclone copy \"/home/me/tmp\" \"onedrive:tmp\" -v --retries 1` both fail.\n- Comparing the directories:\n\nSource is `rclone ls \"/home/me/tmp\" -q`:\n\n<pre>\n        6 test3.t+xt\n        5 test+a.txt\n        6 +test.txt\n        5 a/test+a.txt\n</pre>\n\nDestination `rclone ls \"onedrive:tmp\" -q` is missing a file, other filenames changed:\n\n<pre>\n        5 test a.txt\n        6 test3.t xt\n        5 a/test a.txt\n</pre>\n- Sample log:\n  <pre>2016/08/16 23:45:10 rclone: Version \"v1.32\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"sync\" \"/home/me/tmp\" \"onedrive:tmp\" \"--config\" \".rclone.conf\" \"-v\" \"--retries\" \"1\"]\n  2016/08/16 23:45:11 One drive root 'tmp': Modify window is 1s\n  2016/08/16 23:45:11 One drive root 'tmp': Reading \"\"\n  2016/08/16 23:45:11 One drive root 'tmp': Finished reading \"\"\n  2016/08/16 23:45:11 One drive root 'tmp': Waiting for checks to finish\n  2016/08/16 23:45:11 One drive root 'tmp': Waiting for transfers to finish\n  2016/08/16 23:45:12 +test.txt: Failed to copy: invalidRequest: nameContainsInvalidCharacters: Path (/LiveFolders/tmp/ test.txt) contains invalid leading character.\n  2016/08/16 23:45:12 +test.txt: Removing failed copy\n  2016/08/16 23:45:13 test+a.txt: Copied (new)\n  2016/08/16 23:45:13 test3.t+xt: Copied (new)\n  2016/08/16 23:45:13 +test.txt: Failed to remove failed copy: invalidRequest: generalException: API not found\n  2016/08/16 23:45:13 a/test+a.txt: Copied (new)\n  2016/08/16 23:45:13 One drive root 'tmp': not deleting files as there were IO errors\n  2016/08/16 23:45:13 Attempt 1/1 failed with 1 errors and: not deleting files as there were IO errors\n  2016/08/16 23:45:13 Failed to sync: not deleting files as there were IO errors</pre>\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
