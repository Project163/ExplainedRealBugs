Can be merged (after review)\n\nPaths in local file systems are now all absolute. \n\nChanging \"\\\" to \"/\" prior to that makes \"C:\\\" change to \"C:/\", which is incorrectly interpreted as _current directory_ by `filepath.Abs()`, so we cannot use `filepath.toSlash()` before we make the path absolute.\n\nFixes #124 \n\nTO REVIEW: `filepath.ToSlash()` is removed for ALL filesystems, so they will be served the raw path. This means that \"ACD:\\filedir\\\" is no longer changed to \"ACD:/filedir/\", but that should be handled by each FS, if we keep it as is.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"klauspost","id":5663952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjM5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5663952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost","html_url":"https://github.com/klauspost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-13T16:47:25Z","updated_at":"2015-09-13T16:47:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/90","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/90/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/90/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/90/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/90","id":98934564,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5ODkzNDU2NA==","number":90,"title":"windows:
