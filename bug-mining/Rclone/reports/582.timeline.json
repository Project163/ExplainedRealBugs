Below is a version of rclone which supports SHA1 and MD5 checksums on owncloud and nextcloud.  It uses SHA1 or MD5 as an upload integrity test and will report the checksums in `rclone md5sum` and `rclone sha1sum`.

checksums.\r\n\r\nWheras with my installation of nextcloud the sha1sums were stored if they were uploaded with sha1sums.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/457918651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2099317411,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA5OTMxNzQxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2099317411","actor":{"login":"sp31415t1","id":33207650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjA3NjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33207650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1","html_url":"https://github.com/sp31415t1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-27T13:37:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2099317412,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwOTkzMTc0MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2099317412","actor":{"login":"sp31415t1","id":33207650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjA3NjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33207650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1","html_url":"https://github.com/sp31415t1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sp31415t1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-27T13:37:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2099317473,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MjA5OTMxNzQ3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2099317473","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-27T13:37:33Z","milestone":{"title":"Help

Please make sure of the following things\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have read the [documentation](https://alist.nn.ci).\r\n- [ ] I'm sure there are no duplicate issues or discussions.\r\n- [ ] I'm sure this feature is not implemented.\r\n- [ ] I'm sure it's a reasonable and popular requirement.\r\n\r\n### Description of the feature / 需求描述\r\n\r\nalist的api中存在hashinfo，但WebDAV传递不了例如md5的内容，导致下载后无法进行校验，能否在原有WebDAV协议基础上进行增强，添加alist的相关属性例如hashinfo，这样就可以直接使用checksum检查文件了\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution / 实现思路\r\n\r\n实现思路参考[https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2379]，可以实现alist的自定义的标签，也可以做兼容，相关讨论[https://central.owncloud.org/t/reading-hashes-md5-or-sha1-via-webdav/14348/3]，以下方案参考[https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3147]。\r\n为了兼容性可以这样处理，普通属性查询请求例如：\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\r\n<D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\r\n <D:allprop/>\r\n</D:propfind>\r\n```\r\n不返回自定义属性，使用标准的WebDAV协议，需要指定自定义属性才返回自定义属性\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<d:propfind  xmlns:d=\"DAV:\" xmlns:al=\"http://alist.nn.ci/ns\">\r\n <d:prop>\r\n  <d:displayname />\r\n  <d:getlastmodified />\r\n  <d:getcontentlength />\r\n  <d:resourcetype />\r\n  <d:getcontenttype />\r\n  <al:checksums />\r\n </d:prop>\r\n</d:propfind>\r\n```\r\n或者\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<d:propfind  xmlns:d=\"DAV:\" xmlns:al=\"http://alist.nn.ci/ns\">\r\n <d:prop>\r\n  <d:displayname />\r\n  <d:getlastmodified />\r\n  <d:getcontentlength />\r\n  <d:resourcetype />\r\n  <d:getcontenttype />\r\n  <al:hashinfo />\r\n </d:prop>\r\n</d:propfind>\r\n```\r\n返回内容增加\r\n`<al:checksums><al:checksum>SHA1:f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f MD5:b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 ADLER32:084b021f</al:checksum></al:checksums>`\r\n或者\r\n`<al:hashinfo><al:md5>b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184</al:md5></al:hashinfo>`\r\n可以有效增强校验，减少传输错误导致的文件错误\r\n\r\n### Additional context /
