is nothing exotic. Plain ext4 on ssd drive. Its not even software RAIDed heh.\r\n\r\nAs far as something in Fedora deleting the cache folder it's quite possible. The installation is the Server Fedora stub but it has a LOT of packages installed as it's used as web server, mx server, imap server, samba server, private gitlab server, proxy of a lot of internal services via apache to different subdomains and C++ building environment for my linux C projects. It's mostly daemon packages and software development related packages and libs.\r\n\r\nI will try to identify what process deletes the file with `auditctl` and get back to you. Worst case scenario if it's not rclone doing it and it's something in Fedora that can't easily be fixed, I can change the cache directory target for rclone to something private that won't be affected by fedora packages.\r\n\r\nRegarding the fatality of the error, I'm not sure. While the files seem properly uploaded (every single case I checked), wouldn't downgrading this error to a warning make it impossible for rclone to detect a corrupted upload unless someone actively checks the logs for this and manually verifies the files? Is that not the hash used for upload reliability validation (this is what the code comment seems to suggest)? Or is that being done chunk by chunk? I'm not familiar with the drive API.\r\n\r\nPS I should really get myself to learn golang at some point so I can properly read the code heh.\r\n\r\nPSS On this system there is a second rclone vfs process running by the same user account, operating on the same remote but with different mount point. This is a hackish way I came up with to get around the fact that there is no upload-only bandwidth limit. This second mount point runs with no bandwidth limit and is only used for reading from the remote. Is it possible that the second rclone process is clearing .cache as I added this along the same time with latest package updates? I will turn on its logging to see if it's anything there anyhow.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/379937833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Nodens-","id":2942378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2942378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-","html_url":"https://github.com/Nodens-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/379954804","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2227#issuecomment-379954804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2227","id":379954804,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTk1NDgwNA==","user":{"login":"Nodens-","id":2942378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2942378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-","html_url":"https://github.com/Nodens-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nodens-/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T02:35:37Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T02:39:44Z","body":"Seems like my hunch was right.

Locking is annoyingly platform dependent, but it is possible, however. Here is a flock library I found.\r\n\r\nIndeed, platform differences are annoying. I keep forgetting rclone is supported on Windows as well :)\r\n\r\n> What do you think about those ideas?\r\n\r\nBoth sound good. If an rclone process is not using cache it shouldn't tamper with the cache directory at all. If nothing else, it's a waste of cycles.\r\nI also think at this point rclone could benefit from IPC implementation as that would allow a lot of things (eg shared cache directories, global bandwidth controls for all processes etc)\r\n\r\n>Yes that is what the check does - verify the integrity of the source file.

There will still be an ERROR in the log though.\r\n\r\nYes that is my problem with that approach. Unless you actively check logs (which is tedious when you maintain a lot of systems running it and some with multiple processes) it is possible that corrupted files will just go through and you won't notice. Even having a Logwatch rule for it, I will see it in the daily report but there's a 24 hour window where this scenario can happen:\r\n1) Automated move of backup to cheap cloud storage\r\n2) Upload is corrupted but the error is not fatal\r\n3) Catastrophic failure of original data\r\n4) Realization that uploaded backup is bad\r\n5) Logwatch mail shows checksum was not available but it's now too late.\r\n\r\nI may be a bit paranoid as this is an edge case but what I mostly use gsuite for is cheap storage of backups and snapshots. I'm pushing an average of 2TB total per month from 4 different servers. I'm a small time indie software developer taking mostly consigned work from clients (some huge, some small but the pay is always bad heh). This is the only way I can keep proper backups at my current budget :)\r\nIf there's even a possibility of something being corrupted, I want to know the moment it happens so I can verify it manually. So my vote is that any error that could pertain to data corruption to be kept fatal even if it's an edge case.\r\n\r\n> :-) Go is quite a simple language. C level rather than C++ level and if you know C you'll find it easy to pick up (except for the reversed type definitions!).

I've read a few articles about Go and I find it interesting plus there are a lot of great projects written with it such as rclone and gocryptfs that I use extensively. I may as well contribute back a bit at some point :) I know the syntax is similar and I just looked up Go type definitions haha!
