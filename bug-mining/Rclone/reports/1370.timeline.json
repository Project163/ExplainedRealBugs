Right, I see it has been failing on build of master for some days..\n\nNow with your changes I can build it manually when before it was impossible with the error:\n\n```\n$ go build\n# github.com/rclone/rclone\nlink: duplicated definition of symbol dlopen, from github.com/ebitengine/purego and github.com/ebitengine/purego\n```\n\nSo it should fix automatic build as well.\n\nThank
