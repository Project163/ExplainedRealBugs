is not deleting files that are not owned by the account owner.  This gets in the way of keeping shared folders in sync.\n\nThrough the web-based UI you can still delete non-owned files, and you can also do it through Google Apps Scripts, so I'm pretty sure there is an API call you can make that will allow it.  Try removeFile - that worked in an Apps Script I tried (and some other API calls to send the file to trash did _not_ work).\n\nThank you\n\nOK, more info:\n1) When you purge a non-empty directory, even if that directory contains non-owned files, it works. But the problem is the only way to do it now is to remove the whole directory, and if it's a share directory, then you have to create a new directory and reshare it which isn't a good workflow.\n\n2) When you run: rclone purge remote:SharedFolder/nonOwnedFile.txt it gives the errors:\n-Error 403, insufficient permissions.  This is incorrect, as the owner of the folder does have permission to delete a shared file.\n-Failed to purge: can't rmdir in limited fs\n\n3) When you run rclone purge remote:SharedFolder/OwnedFile.txt it actually does delete the file but it gives the error \"Failed to purge: can't rmdir in limited fs.\"\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":394858128,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk0ODU4MTI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/394858128","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5c226e91c0ca2ccd247f71758d190bf121b72dd2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/5c226e91c0ca2ccd247f71758d190bf121b72dd2","created_at":"2015-08-28T08:54:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
