What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nSome backends do not provide object size and simply return -1, e.g. Google Docs documents in Google Drive backend.\r\nCurrent version of ncdu does not consider this and end up summing directory sizes including such negative numbers.\r\n\r\n##### Main changes with this PR:\r\n\r\n- Files are still reported with size -1 as before, when that is what the backend reports.\r\n- Directory sizes skip negative file sizes (assumes size 0) in the sum, and a new flag `~` is added at start of line and description indicating the size may be underestimated at end of line for directories which contain any such files (recursively).\r\n   - The value for average size in directory does *not* consider such files, i.e. the average is an average over files with known sizes. This means it may be *over*estimated rather than *under*estimated which is always the case with total sizes.\r\n- Adds documentation of all supported one-character flags.\r\n\r\n##### Details:\r\n\r\nAverage size is as stated above an average over files with known sizes. An alternative method could be to also include the files with unknown size, treat them as files with size 0. This would underestimate the average, possibly by much, compared to the current method which ignores them completely (in the count and size when calculating size/count). Its a matter of interpretation (average is average of what?) and of taste, probably, but the chosen approach should give least surprises, and is now documented.\r\n\r\nPicked `~` as indicator to indicate \"size issues\", because it typically represents an approximation, and also it is not used by \"upstream\" ncdu (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/impish/man1/ncdu.1.html#file%20flags). This means rclone ncdu currently supports the following:\r\n- Indicator `~` (**new**) that can occur on directories, and it indicates that this directory, or any of its subdirectories, contain a file which the backend reported size -1 for. This file is not included, i.e. treated as size 0, in the summed directory size. It is not included in calculation of the average, neither in count or size, i.e. average is average over files with known sizes only.\r\n    - Combined with line suffix `[1 of 27 files have unknown size, size may be underestimated]`\r\n        - TODO: A bit long suffix string!? But no longer than the existing for indicator `.`. In addition, it states the size may be *under*estimated, while if showing average sizes, these may be *over*estimated or *under*estimated depending on the characteristics of the files (e.g. if the files with unknown sizes not included in average calculation is larger or smaller than the rest). Though, the message could be interpreted as primarily referring to the directory total size, which is shown by default, and not so much to the optional average size field. Also existing message for for indicator `.` already used \"size may be underestimated\". Or perhaps \"1 of 27 files have unknown size\" is enough to tell users that size is underestimated or inaccurate or whatever? No strong preference, but ended up with the above suggestion.\r\n- Indicator `e` (**existing**) means it is an empty directory, i.e. contains no files - count is zero.\r\n    - Could also mean directory has been discovered but not traversed yet, then there will be a suffix `[not read yet]`.\r\n        - TODO: Could have changed this to use the new `~` indicator instead, but still with the `[not read yet]` suffix?\r\n- Indicator `.` (**existing**) means failed to read a subdirectory, and the entire line will be colored yellow.\r\n    - Combined with line suffix `[some subdirectories could not be read, size may be underestimated]`.\r\n- Indicator `!` (**existing**) means failed to read that directory, and the entire line will be colored red, and a suffix with error message is added.\r\n\r\nSee also comments below for more details, from testing and discussing different solutions.\r\n\r\n##### Additional notes:\r\n\r\n- In the code I implemented handling of the new `~` indicator by just extending on the same approach as existing code, but its starting to get a bit many number of different variables to pass around and combinations to handle, so it would probably benefit from some refactoring. I chose not to go there with this pr, but can do it if reviewer prefer..\r\n- The `rclone size` also reports -1 size for files in the same cases as above, but it already correctly ignores them in directory sums. It does not indicate anything like \"size may be underestimated\" in these cases though, but perhaps that should be implemented as well.
