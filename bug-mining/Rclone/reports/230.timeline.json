Allows users to build their own packages if required\n- Updates docs with instructions on installation of rclone with packages\n\nSo, I've made a basic proof-of-concept automated package building pipeline using fpm-cookery and werker:\n\nhttps://github.com/petems/rclone-build\n\nExample of created RPM build:\nhttps://app.wercker.com/petems/rclone-build/runs/build/57c9ac9cde98cd0100976bb7?step=57c9acad72790a0001243976\n\nThis uses a docker image for CentOS, creates a package and would be able to push it up to https://PackageCloud.io using an API token\n\nThe ideal end use-case would be proper addition to upstream repositories, and I'm looking into the Debian process to do this, but it's a lot more difficult than this minimum viable packaging 💃 \n\n@ncw I'd like to get your view on this 😄\n\nSome basic questions:\n- Would a package added to the artifact download be ok in your eyes, similar to the current tarballs, then the user would manage the repistory management steps required (eg. upload to Satelite channel, creation of Ubuntu launchpad instance)\n- How about an account in PackageCloud.io, allowing users to easily install the package including repo setup and GPG signing? I don't mind chipping in to pay on this if it got popular enough, would help me a lot\n- How do you feel about fpm abstraction vs raw dsc/specfile?\n\nRelates to https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/354, https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/136 and tangentally
