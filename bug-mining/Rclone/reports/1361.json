I thought i'd write a feature request for completeness. Feel free to close this feature request if not applicable. I may be able to implement this feature myself in rclone if this is something you are interested in.\n\n**Overview**\n\nI'd like to request a new feature that allows rclone to transfer only a portion of a server's content. This feature would enable users to run multiple rclone instances concurrently, with each instance responsible for a distinct subset of files. The goal is to facilitate distributed transfers and avoid duplicate work when syncing or copying large datasets.\n\n**Proposed Approach**\n\nIntroduce a new flag, `--worker`, where the argument is formatted as `worker_id:(n_workers-1)`. For example:\n\n- `rclone copy ... --worker 0:1`  \n- `rclone copy ... --worker 1:1`\n\nIn the above example, two workers are deployed, and each will handle roughly 50% of the files.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nFor each file to be transferred, rclone will calculate a hash based on the file's path (e.g., using MD5). Then, using the worker parameters, it determines if the current worker should process the file based on the following pseudocode:\n\n```python\nworker_id = [provided worker id]\nn_workers = [total number of workers]\n\nfor each file in files_to_copy:\n    md5_hash = md5(file.path)\n    # The addition of worker_id helps in balancing the distribution\n    if (md5_hash + worker_id) % n_workers == 0:\n         transfer(file)\n    else:\n         skip(file)\n```\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
