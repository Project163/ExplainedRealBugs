I can't set the tier from archive to cool, so I can't really retrieve the file. I guess I can grab the encrypted path, and set tier from there, but it's not convenient, and requires some scripting. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n1.45\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu Server 18.04.1, 64 bit\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
