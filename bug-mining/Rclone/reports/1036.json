We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\n[Can I skip or suppress errors for dangling shortcuts?](https://forum.rclone.org/t/can-i-skip-or-suppress-errors-for-dangling-shortcuts/25095)\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nrclone v1.56.1\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nI need to skip dangling shortcuts because they are been created in a folder shared with me but I don't have the rights to delete them.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nI need a new flag to skip dangling  shortcuts like --drive-skip-dangling-shortcuts. Another solution could be change error to warning in case of dangling  shortcuts when --drive-skip-dangling-shortcuts is used.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
