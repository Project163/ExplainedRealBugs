for testing.  It seems likely that the problem is in the OSXFUSE layer since it is in both mount and cmount.\r\n\r\nThis issue https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/396 seems to agree with me that the values are 32 bit and hence are wrapping.  There appears to be an extended interface which neither of the upstream libraries I'm using implement.\r\n\r\nHere is an rclone with a work-around which clips the number of blocks to the maximum the OS can support.  This will let disks get to be 16 TB and above that the free/avail etc will show as 16 TB.\r\n\r\nCan you give this a go and report back what `df -h` says and see if `f_bavail` looks sensible?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.rclone.org/branch/v1.42-013-gc9749454-fix-2356-macOS-mount/ (uploaded in 15-30
