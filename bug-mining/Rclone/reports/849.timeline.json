to respond. But I can post the values of the current run again after some time if you want to have the values of the same run.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that I'm using a timetable for the bandwith limits. So the second api response (which I did about 10 minutes after the restart of rclone) was not influenced by all the timeslots (because it was not running for a whole day) and the first one was (because it was running for 8 days). But even though my timetable has an unlimited-speed-slot for a few hours a day it is absolutely impossible that the speed is that high since the maximum upload of my internet connection is less than 10 mbit/s and since the first response was captured in a timeslot with a 350K speed limit.\r\n\r\nAnd yes I can imagine too that it has to do something with the 32bit OS.

Are you doing anything else other than reading stats from this while it is running?\r\n> \r\n> Are the jobs being put in via the RC or from the command line?\r\n\r\nMy setup looks like this: I have rclone running on a raspberry pi. It mounts a directory (my cloudstorage) which is used as a directory of a samba server. This way I can use a samba server to store files into the cloud without having to wait for the upload to complete. It works really well as far as I can see. I added a few hundred gigabytes about a week ago. Since my second run from above nothing was added, rclone is just continuing to upload its cache. Also I didn't use the rc to change anything, I only use it via the webui to monitor the upload progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> This says you've been running for 87 minutes but only transferring for 24 minutes.\r\n\r\nYes. But in this timeframe I uploaded `\"bytes\": 1872030707,`, which if divided by the `\"elapsedTime\": 5223.129277676` is `358 420`. This adds up almost perfectly with the 350K speed limit which was in place at that time.
