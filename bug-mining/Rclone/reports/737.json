So I propose an --order-by flag with two options type and order where the type can be any file property.\r\nFor example:\r\n`rclone --order-by=name,ascending copy remote:somewhere/ here/` or \r\n`rclone --order-by=size,descending copy remote:somewhereelse/ alsohere/`. \r\nThis might take longer because I think you'd have to first build the full list of files then sort it for most remotes, but for certain types of content this is preferable to the random order that rclone currently uses.\r\n\r\nThis flag would also be nice for the listing and checksum commands.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1205/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
