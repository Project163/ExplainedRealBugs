I know I can execute `rclone version`, but then I need to perform string parsing and also I need to run a process instead of just accessing file properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyncthing has implemented this in go already, so I'm thinking it wouldn't be too hard if using it as inspiration.\r\n> On Windows generate a special file which the Go compiler will automatically use when generating Windows binaries to set things like the file icon, version, etc.\r\n\r\n(https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/build.go)\r\n\r\nSolution seems to be based on executing a command line utility, [GoVersionInfo](https://github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo), during the build process.\r\n\r\nI could try to implement this myself, if you agree it is a good idea, but I am not proficient in go so may be needing some pointers along the way (for instance I am not sure if this introduces some changes to how the build process must be performed).\r\n\r\nAnother step up would be to authenticode sign the executable, but that requires a certificate etc so would need a bit more effort - and probably money.
