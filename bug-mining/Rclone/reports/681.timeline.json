The latest version definitely seems to improve things, although there might still be a small (related?) issue left. I'm still testing, but on the first run there were a large number of file transfers without adding open file handles, so that's good. \r\n\r\nAt a certain point the sync seemed to stay stuck and stalled the queue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:19 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Presikhaaf1-280x187.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:19 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Presikhaaf1-300x200.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:19 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Presikhaaf1-585x187.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:20 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Presikhaaf1-e1402236174182.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:20 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Presikhaaf1.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:20 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Sonsbeek-300x200.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:21 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Sonsbeek-280x187.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:21 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Sonsbeek-585x187.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:22 INFO  : multisite/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2014/05/3-Park-Sonsbeek.jpg: Copied (new)\r\n2019/09/18 19:04:32 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:       49.583M / 714.847 MBytes, 7%, 230.098 kBytes/s, ETA 49m20s\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:            166726 / 166726, 100%\r\nTransferred:          505 / 10517, 5%\r\nElapsed time:     3m40.6s\r\nTransferring:\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-280x187.jpg:200% /27.923k, 5.072k/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-300x200.jpg:  0% /31.452k, 0/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-585x187.jpg:  0% /52.271k, 0/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…5/3-Park-Sonsbeek1.jpg:  0% /341.006k, 0/s, -\r\n\r\n2019/09/18 19:05:32 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:       49.583M / 714.847 MBytes, 7%, 180.906 kBytes/s, ETA 1h2m45s\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:            166726 / 166726, 100%\r\nTransferred:          505 / 10517, 5%\r\nElapsed time:     4m40.6s\r\nTransferring:\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-280x187.jpg:200% /27.923k, 102/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-300x200.jpg:  0% /31.452k, 0/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-585x187.jpg:  0% /52.271k, 0/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…5/3-Park-Sonsbeek1.jpg:  0% /341.006k, 0/s, -\r\n\r\n2019/09/18 19:06:32 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:       49.583M / 714.847 MBytes, 7%, 149.044 kBytes/s, ETA 1h16m10s\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:            166726 / 166726, 100%\r\nTransferred:          505 / 10517, 5%\r\nElapsed time:     5m40.6s\r\nTransferring:\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-280x187.jpg:200% /27.923k, 2/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-300x200.jpg:  0% /31.452k, 0/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…-Sonsbeek1-585x187.jpg:  0% /52.271k, 0/s, -\r\n * multisite/wp-content/u…5/3-Park-Sonsbeek1.jpg:  0% /341.006k, 0/s, -\r\n```\r\nThese files also stayed visible as open handles with 'wc -l'.
