I'm writing with an active issue that seems to affect `rclone nfsmount` on macOS.**\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-v1-65-0-release/43100/25?u=scuba-tech\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\n**ALL** attempts to copy files of any size or type, from Finder into OneDrive, via `nfsmount` fail. \r\n\r\nIt is not possible to write from Finder or save work. It *is* possible to read/open files.\r\n\r\nSimple writing operations like `touch` and `cat > filename` from a shell do write properly into nfsmount.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n1.65.0 via brew\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\n**macOS Sonoma (14.1.1)** // ARM64\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft OneDrive (personal family // 6TB)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n`rclone nfsmount --vfs-cache-mode full --filter-from \"/Users/<user>/.config/rclone/rclone-filter-rules.txt\" OD: ~/MOUNT-OneDrive --verbose`\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. I am using `--vfs-cache-mode full` to allow writing with OneDrive. Using none gives an (expected) read-only error message.\r\n2. Here are the contents of my filter rules file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- **/.DS_Store\r\n- **/.hidden*\r\n- **/._*\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] No file for lookup of ._GH010215.mp4\r\n[ERROR] call to 0x106<###>  failed: No such file or directory\r\nINFO  : SdT-Inboxes/GH010215.mp4: vfs cache: removed cache file as file deleted\r\n[ERROR] No file for lookup of ._7F2A7976.JPG\r\n[ERROR] call to 0x106<###>  failed: No such file or directory\r\n[ERROR] err loading attrs for SdT-Inboxes/GH010215.mp4: file does not exist\r\n[ERROR] No file for lookup of ._7F2A7977.JPG\r\n[ERROR] call to 0x106<###>  failed: No such file or directory\r\n[ERROR] err loading attrs for SdT-Inboxes/GH010215.mp4: file does not exist\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"684\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/assets/35608185/9d2adedc-09e3-44e5-b4c5-bf5b91602585\">\r\n\r\n\r\nConfirming that the copy into the mount _did fail_, checking with Finder, `ls -hAls`, and even OneDrive webUI... all of these confirm that the file does **not** actually \"already exist\" as the error message above claims!\r\n\r\nI hope this report helps with getting `nfsmount` sorted. :) \r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
