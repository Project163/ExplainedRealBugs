I haven't worked on it.\r\n\r\nI would start by looking at stuff interacting with configs. Description (I assume) is only shown in commands interacting purely with config, and not elsewhere. Look at how the config is created (can be through cli commands or interactively exists) and reading/showing the field (`$ rclone config` without doing anything). There is most likely a generic remote configuration holder. (the key-value what holds remote name, etc; non-generic: (sftp) host, (sftp) username)\r\n\r\nMake sure you have a command to set-get the description programatically.
