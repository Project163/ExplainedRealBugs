understand you are having a problem with rclone; we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\n**STOP and READ**\r\n**YOUR POST WILL BE REMOVED IF IT IS LOW QUALITY**:\r\nPlease show the effort you've put into solving the problem and please be specific.\r\nPeople are volunteering their time to help! Low effort posts are not likely to get good answers!\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, try to replicate it with the latest beta (or stable).\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf you can still replicate it or just got a question then please use the rclone forum:\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\nfor a quick response instead of filing an issue on this repo.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else helps, then please fill in the info below which helps us help you.\r\n\r\n**DO NOT REDACT** any information except passwords/keys/personal info.\r\n\r\nYou should use 3 backticks to begin and end your paste to make it readable.\r\n\r\nMake sure to include a log obtained with '-vv'.\r\n\r\nYou can also use '-vv --log-file bug.log' and a service such as https://pastebin.com or https://gist.github.com/\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\nI do not frequent the forums, I could not find a thread that discusses the issue at hand though.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nwhen using rclone as a mount helper (by simlinking to /usr/sbin/mount.rclone as described [here](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#rclone-as-unix-mount-helper)\r\n\r\nThe relevant example in the documentation does not work, specifically it recommend adding an fstab line like the following:\r\n\r\n    sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0\r\n\r\nthis results in rclone failing as it doesn't seem to handle the leading underscore of `_netdev` properly. When using this configuration I get an error message:\r\n\r\n    [root@virt0 ~]# mount /var/lib/external/wasabi/public\r\n    2021/11/11 19:22:51 Failed to parse command line: option name can't start with `-` or `_`\r\n\r\nthe actual line in my fstab:\r\n\r\n    wasabi-public:stuff.public /var/lib/external/wasabi/public rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd-automount,x-systemd.mount-timeout=30,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone/wasabi/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone,env.AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/etc/rclone/wasabi/aws/credentials,env.AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/rclone/wasabi/aws/config,allow_other 0 0\r\n\r\nchanging it to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwasabi-public:xyz.akdev.public /var/lib/external/wasabi/public rclone rw,noauto,nofail,x-systemd-automount,x-systemd.mount-timeout=30,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone/wasabi/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone,env.AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/etc/rclone/wasabi/aws/credentials,env.AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/rclone/wasabi/aws/config,allow_other 0 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nallows the volume to be mounted successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@virt0 ~]# rclone --version\r\nrclone v1.57.0\r\n- os/version: centos 8 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 4.18.0-348.el8.x86_64 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.17.2\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nanswered above, centos 8 stream 64bit \r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nwasabi - s3 provider\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nmount /var/lib/external/wasabi/public\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nAdding `vvv` to the mount opts did not seem to create more logs than observed above. Seems like the main rclone process is not even getting executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
