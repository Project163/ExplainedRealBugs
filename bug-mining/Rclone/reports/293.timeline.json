I think i figured it out.\r\nBut it is really weird the only reason for this happening now is onedrive changing their api.\r\nUnless the old code base used an old go version but I also tested this issue with old version of rclone (1.35) and I can reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nIt seems like all the escape methods for path are using `net/url` `QueryEscape` instead of `PathEscape`\r\n`QueryEscape` escapes spaces as '+' which onedirve interprets as literal '+' path escape is escaping them as '%20' which seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately  `PathEscape` is only available in go 1.8\r\nI'll submit a pull request with the changes to onedrive but this will not work without go 1.8 and I assume before upgrading go full integration tests needs to be done on all remotes which is
