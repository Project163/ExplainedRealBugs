--backup-dir option would be a great addition.  Server-side copying goes part of the way to providing versioned backups, but it takes a very long time when there are a lot of files, and it can make wasteful use of the remote storage, depending on how the remote storage deals with duplicate files.\n\nI think all you need is a --backup-dir option, and not a --backup option with suffixes.  Suffixes would be more complicated, because then you have to worry about what suffix to add, and what filters to add to exclude the suffixed files. \n\nThe logic for --backup-dir would simple:\n- If a copy,  sync, or move operation would replace or remove an existing destination file, first move that file to the backup-dir path.\n\nLike with a normal move, the destination path and backup-dir path should not overlap.  Some consideration must be made for what to do when a file to be moved already exists in the backup-dir path. For versioned backups, I'd argue that it makes sense to preserve the file that already exists in the backup-dir path.  But in other circumstances, it might make more sense to replace the file in the backup-dir path.  Maybe that should be an option.\n\nSample command:\n\n> `rclone sync \"c:\\My Documents\" \"remote:backup/current/My Documents\" --backup-dir \"remote:backup/old versions/My Documents\"`\n\nRelative paths should be preserved.  So if `remote:backup/current/My Documents/Folder/file.txt` existed in the destination and would be replaced or removed, it would be moved to `remote:backup/old versions/My Documents/Folder/file.txt`.  \n\nUnder this backup scheme, the destination path would be a proper sync of the source, and old versions & deleted files could be found in some backup-dir path.  In typical usage, the backup-dir path would contain a date, and it would be up to the user to remove old folders after sufficient time has passed.  This seems simpler than some of the ideas in issue #18 . \n\nYou might add a restriction that the backup-dir path be in the same remote as the destination path, if that makes things easier.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/233792413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"balazer","id":183813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer","html_url":"https://github.com/balazer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/balazer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"leocrawford","id":915016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/915016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford","html_url":"https://github.com/leocrawford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leocrawford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-08T20:34:41Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T20:34:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/18","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/18/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/18/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/18/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/18","id":54717891,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDcxNzg5MQ==","number":18,"title":"rclone

Nick,\n\nI'm currently using s3ql to mount remote S3/GCS data as a local filesystem (through fuse), and then use a [shell script](https://github.com/iceburg-net/ansible-pcd/blob/master/roles/pcd-apps/backup/templates/backup_sites.sh.j2) to implement rsync based backups to this filesystem.\n\nI'd like to make use of rclone based backups in ansible-pcd -- for its simplicity and for user friendliness (e.g. browsing on the remote end will display the backed up files themselves -- versus s3ql which displays indecipherable filesystem metadata).\n\nFor the majority of \"backups\", it's important to have incremental functionality that allows you to a restore a file from \"yesterday\" w/o having \"todays\" changes override and make that impossible. E.g. snapshots/rotations/&c. \n\nMost incremental strategies  also make subsequent backups efficient by limiting what gets backed up to changed components only; speeding up runtime and transfer time, and saving space @ the backup destination.\n\nProtecting against file corruption making its way into downstream [snapshots/rotations/&c] is also a plus.\n\nI think rclone handles the syncing component well -- although don't see anything apparent re: incremental snapshotting.  Do you plan to implement or could you share your thoughts on this feature? \n\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

This would be a very good feature to add to rclone.\n\nI use 3 directory: \n\nRSYNC  - the destination dir\nRSYNC_BAK - where the changed files are stored\nRSYNC_DEL - where the deleted files are stored\n\nI use 2 commands,  the first do not delete files on destination (RSYNC) that was removed from source, it just move  changed files to the backup-dir (RSYNC_BAK) and add a date and time label to the end of each file name before store the newer versions. For easy find files from a specific date, we add a directory for each month in the backup-dir path. \n\nThe second command move the deleted files to the backup-dir (RSYNC_DEL). This command runs just after the first one.\n\nAs an example, lets say a local file  /drawing/ele/E1500025.dwg was changed a lot before being removed and the file  /drawing/hid/H1500012.DWG  also was changed but not removed. It would end up with this files on remote:\n\nRSYNC/drawing/hid/H1500012.dwg\n\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/hid/H1500012.dwg__2016_08_17_224039\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/hid/H1500012.dwg__2016_08_18_125240\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/hid/H1500012.dwg__2016_08_22_224135\n\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/ele/E1500025.dwg__2016_08_03_224007\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/ele/E1500025.dwg__2016_08_04_125246\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/ele/E1500025.dwg__2016_08_08_224054\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/ele/E1500025.dwg__2016_08_11_223952\nRSYNC_BAK/2016_08/drawing/ele/E1500025.dwg__2016_08_17_224039\n\nRSYNC_DEL/drawing/ele/E1500025.dwg\n\nThe 2 commands I use is like bellow\n\nrsync -av --acls --xattrs --stats --backup --backup-dir=/RSYNC_BAK/2016_08 --suffix=__2016_08_17_224039      /drawing       /RSYNC\n\nrsync -av --acls --xattrs --stats --backup --backup-dir=/RSYNC_DEL  --delete      /drawing      /RSYNC\n\nOr\n\nBASE=\"/RSYNC\"\nBASE_DEL=\"/RSYNC_DEL\"\nBASE_BAK=\"/RSYNC_BAK\"\n\ndir=\"/drawing\"\n\nrsync -av --acls  --xattrs  --stats --backup --backup-dir=${BASE_BAK}  --suffix=$(date +\"__%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S\")  ${dir}  ${BASE}\n\nrsync -av --acls  --xattrs  --stats --backup --backup-dir=${BASE_DEL} --delete  ${dir}  ${BASE}\n\nThank you\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/241783966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"robjlg","id":19288510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjg4NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19288510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg","html_url":"https://github.com/robjlg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjlg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/245630084","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/98#issuecomment-245630084","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/98","id":245630084,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTYzMDA4NA==","user":{"login":"stephenjamieson","id":1823637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjM2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1823637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson","html_url":"https://github.com/stephenjamieson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenjamieson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-08T15:10:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T15:10:11Z","body":"This

 Amazon Cloud Drive doesn't allow a user to 'empty' the trash.  I get hundreds of thousands of 'deleted' files because of the way in which rclone removes files rather than directories.  To make the problem even worse, Amazon only lets a user delete 1000 'objects' at a time.   Worse yet they don't provide an API to do it programatically.  I've actually had to create a iMacros browser job to purge it which I run periodically overnight to 'empty' the trash. :)\n\nThe way Amazon 'deletes' work is if a DIRECTORY is deleted, it puts the 'directory' object in the trash and then you can permanently delete that directory even if it contains hundreds of thousands of files.  You simply delete the ONE directory.  When files are deleted individually, all the files individually get put in the trash instead and you'd need to delete EACH file separately up to 1000 at a time via the GUI.\n\nMy thought is if we create a delete mechanism similar to rsync where we could specify a directory that deletes go to rather than actually deleting the files, then we could could go through and make purging the trash easier. Simply delete the directory to the trash and then to empty the trash, simply delete the directory once in a while.\n\nrsync provides a similar functionality.\nrsync:\n -b, --backup                make backups (see --suffix & --backup-dir)\n     --backup-dir=DIR        make backups into hierarchy based in DIR\n     --suffix=SUFFIX         set backup suffix (default ~ w/o --backup-dir)\n\nI was thinking we could have the same options in rclone.  \n\nThe --backup tells rclone to move the files rather than delete them.  If a --backup-dir is not specified, it would (same as rsync) simply move them in the same hierarchy as they are in now but suffix them.  The default in rsync is the tilde but we could use a date-time or some other default if we wanted to.\n\nThe --backup-dir would move them directly to the backup-dir with the suffix (default if not specified).  We could follow the same functionality in rsync to create the hierarchy but we don't have to either.\n\nThe --suffix would let us override the default suffix.\n\nSo we would then specify --backup and optionally the other two depending on our needs and rclone wouldn't use the trash any longer.  It would backup via 'moves' to locations/naming we specify.  This also fixes the ACD problem of not being ale to empty the trash because we could then place entire folders in the trash and then purge it because we only need to 'delete permanently' the one record of the directory.\n\nThoughts?
