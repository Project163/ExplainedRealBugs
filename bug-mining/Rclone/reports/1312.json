I reopened the issue but it didn't get visibility\r\n\r\nIf I sync a single file and then an lsl of the remote file, I can see that it still only has one-second resolution, not millisecond resolution. A subsequent run of sync still reports that it has to adjust the modification time. That is, it appears `--refresh-times` is not working.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.68.0\r\n- os/version: ubuntu 22.04 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.15.0-101-generic (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.23.1\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu 22.04.2 LTS\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
