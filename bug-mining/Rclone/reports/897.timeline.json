https://gist.github.com/jpillora/b480fde82bff51a06238\r\n\r\nThis contains the code\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tfor {\r\n\t\ttcpConn, err := listener.Accept()\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Failed to accept incoming connection (%s)\", err)\r\n\t\t\tcontinue\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t// Before use, a handshake must be performed on the incoming net.Conn.\r\n\t\tsshConn, chans, reqs, err := ssh.NewServerConn(tcpConn, config)\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\tlog.Printf(\"Failed to handshake (%s)\", err)\r\n\t\t\tcontinue\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"New SSH connection from %s (%s)\", sshConn.RemoteAddr(), sshConn.ClientVersion())\r\n\t\t// Discard all global out-of-band Requests\r\n\t\tgo ssh.DiscardRequests(reqs)\r\n\t\t// Accept all channels\r\n\t\tgo handleChannels(chans)\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this code is that calling `ssh.NewServerConn` can take an arbitrary length of time as it might have to ask the user for a password. In fact calling it like this is setting up a potential DoS attack - one user can take as long as desired to do the authentication, blocking any other users from connecting.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `ssh.NewServerConn` should be changed to say that it **must** be called in a new go routine and **should not** be called in in the same go routine as the `Listen` loop.\r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea if [the example for ssh.NewServerConn](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#example-NewServerConn) was changed to show a loop around the `Listen` call with the `ssh.NewServerConn` being called in a go routine.\r\n\r\nThis was originally discovered in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4882 - thanks to @FiloSottile for working out the cause of the problem and suggesting making this
