I've tried three times and I still get the same errors. Every single symlink shows that error (yes, the path has 634 symbolic links). If it matters the path points to a mounted veracrypt container formated as NTFS.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n1.53.0\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nWindows 10 x64\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n`rclone copy Y:\\ Crypt:Boo --verbose --no-update-modtime --transfers 14 --checkers 16 --contimeout 60s --timeout 300s --retries 3 --low-level-retries 10 --exclude /$RECYCLE.BIN/** --exclude /System Volume Information/** --create-empty-src-dirs --backup-dir Crypt:Rem --links --bwlimit Mon-08:00,7M 23:59,off Tue-08:00,7M 23:59,off --max-size 30M --stats 1s --stats-file-name-length 0 --fast-list`\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nI see a lot of lines like this and also this is a piece of the end of the log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:31 ERROR : redacted.mkv.rclonelink: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 106\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:31 INFO  : redacted.rclonelink: Removing failed copy\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:31 ERROR : redacted2.mp4.rclonelink: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 37\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:31 INFO  : redacted2.mp4.rclonelink: Removing failed copy\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:31 ERROR : redacted3.mkv.rclonelink: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 87\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:31 INFO  : redacted3.mkv.rclonelink: Removing failed copy\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:31 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:   \t  218.229k / 217.749 kBytes, 100%, 357 Bytes/s, ETA -\r\nErrors:               634 (retrying may help)\r\nChecks:             68649 / 68649, 100%\r\nTransferred:            0 / 4, 0%\r\nElapsed time:     20m25.7s\r\nTransferring:\r\n* redacted4.rclonelink:  0% /0, 19/s, -\r\n* redacted3.mp4.rclonelink:  0% /0, 16/s, -\r\n* redacted2.mkv.rclonelink:  0% /0, 26/s, -\r\n* redacted.mkv.rclonelink:  0% /0, 30/s, -\r\n\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:32 INFO  : There was nothing to transfer\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:32 ERROR : Attempt 3/3 failed with 634 errors and: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 87\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:32 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:   \t  218.229k / 218.229 kBytes, 100%, 356 Bytes/s, ETA 0s\r\nErrors:               634 (retrying may help)\r\nChecks:             68649 / 68649, 100%\r\nElapsed time:     20m26.7s\r\n\r\n2020/09/10 01:59:32 Failed to copy with 634 errors: last error was: corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 0 vs 87\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
