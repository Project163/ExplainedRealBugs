Everything seems fine except for large files. There are several thousand files in this directory but only one that is over the large file limit (5GB) of the B2 api. Every time I run the `sync` operation the large file is re-uploaded. Also it seems like the large file is not uploaded to the correct path.\n\nFor example, the directory hiearchy I am sync'ing is `/files/photos` -> `BUCKET/files/photos`. The large file is `/files/photos/wedding-photos.zip` which should be uploaded to `BUCKET/files/photos/wedding-photos.zip` but instead it is landing at the root of the bucket: `BUCKET/wedding-photos.zip`.\n\nSummary: The upload seems to complete OK, for what it's worth, it just ends up in the wrong place on the destination and is uploaded everytime a `sync` is run.\n\nI am using the v1.30-21-g018fe80β build which I found in another thread about Backblaze bugs/imiprovements.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
