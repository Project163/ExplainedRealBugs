What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nrclone mount --cache-dir string  will change the vfs cache directory location and the vfsMeta directory location but .cache/rclone/webgui will still be created in the same default location. When I used the command earlier I thought it was extremely unexpected behavior as I had expected the command to create a .cache directory containing all of those items in the specified location, instead I ended up with the webgui in the default .cache location and the vfs & vfsMeta directories created as two top-level independent directories in the location I had specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.53.3\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15.5\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nDebian\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
