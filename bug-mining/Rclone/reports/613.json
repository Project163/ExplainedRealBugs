For me if I want to download a file from the web  container administration page, I have a 10 minutes countdown before I can actually download the file (eg. http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1552233583.png )\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nclone --version\r\nrclone v1.46.0-065-g58d9a3e1-beta\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nSystem:    Host: thierrybo-desk Kernel: 4.19.0-0.bpo.2-amd64 x86_64 (64 bit)\r\n           Desktop: Openbox 3.6.1 Distro: Devuan GNU/Linux ascii\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
