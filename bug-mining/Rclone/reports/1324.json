I tried to register, but the confirmation email isn't arriving. In any case, I think this is a bug. Or if I'm doing it wrong, it's probably still an omission in the documentation.\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nIn one terminal, start rcd listening on a Unix domain socket:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone rcd --rc-addr unix:///tmp/rclone.socket\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn another, try to connect to it. This doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone rc --url /tmp/rclone.socket rc/noop\r\n{\r\n\t\"error\": \"connection failed: Post \\\"http:///tmp/rclone.socket/rc/noop\\\": http: no Host in request URL\",\r\n\t\"path\": \"rc/noop\",\r\n\t\"status\": 503\r\n}\r\n2024/12/17 17:20:11 NOTICE: Failed to rc: connection failed: Post \"http:///tmp/rclone.socket/rc/noop\": http: no Host in request URL\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I initially tried `--url unix:///tmp/rclone.socket` but it mangles the URL to `http://unix///tmp/rclone.socket/rc/noop`, which is a separate issue.)\r\n\r\nI can reproduce it with socat as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/rclone.socket \r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request: missing required Host header\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n400 Bad Request: missing required Host header\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I do give a `Host` header, the request succeeds:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/rclone.socket \r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\nServer: rclone/v1.68.2\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nDate: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 16:16:33 GMT\r\nContent-Length: 10\r\n\r\nNot Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.68.2\r\n- os/version: arch (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.11.6-arch1-1 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.23.3\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nArch Linux x86_64\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
