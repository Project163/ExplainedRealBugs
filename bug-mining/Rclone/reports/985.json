is a feature idea from https://github.com/sapk/docker-volume-rclone/issues/6.\r\nIt would be fairly possible to add a `rclone serve docker` command exposing a docker volume api if allowed by rclone maintainers.\r\n\r\nThe implentation is in fact a combination of `mount` and http server with a limited number of API commands (create, remove, mount, unmount).\r\nCurrently implemented by https://github.com/sapk/docker-volume-rclone mostly in https://github.com/sapk/docker-volume-rclone/blob/master/rclone/driver/driver.go.\r\nAs can be seen, the codebase is pretty small.","closed_by":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4750/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4750/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
