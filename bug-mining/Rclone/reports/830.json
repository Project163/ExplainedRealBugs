The rclone docs mention that this is only a problem with `rclone copy`, however I just did an `rclone sync` to upload ~30k files to onedrive and every document has at least two versions, separately taking storage quota. \r\n\r\nIt is not possible to disable file versioning unless you are a SharePoint admin, and Microsoft only provides a way to remove the versions file-by-file.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThe SharePoint .NET API allows the removal of older versions, as [in this project](https://github.com/balassy/OneDriveVersionCleaner). However I could not get this to compile under dotnet core in Linux, possibly because [the specific SharePoint library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/complete-basic-operations-using-sharepoint-client-library-code) requires additional Windows dll-s. Nevertheless I think that there might be a way to interface with this API through rclone.
