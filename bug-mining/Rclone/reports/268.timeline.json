please have a go with it in this beta\r\n\r\nhttp://beta.rclone.org/v1.35-87-g006227b/ (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nHere are the bits from the docs\r\n\r\n## Logging ##\r\n\r\nrclone has 4 levels of logging, `Error`, `Notice`, `Info` and `Debug`.\r\n\r\nBy default rclone logs to standard error.  This means you can redirect\r\nstandard error and still see the normal output of rclone commands (eg\r\n`rclone ls`).\r\n\r\nBy default rclone will produce `Error` and `Notice` level messages.\r\n\r\nIf you use the `-q` flag, rclone will only produce `Error` messages.\r\n\r\nIf you use the `-v` flag, rclone will produce `Error`, `Notice` and\r\n`Info` messages.\r\n\r\nIf you use the `-vv` flag, rclone will produce `Error`, `Notice`,\r\n`Info` and `Debug` messages.\r\n\r\nYou can also control the log levels with the `--log-level` flag.\r\n\r\nIf you use the `--log-file=FILE` option, rclone will redirect `Error`,\r\n`Info` and `Debug` messages along with standard error to FILE.\r\n\r\nIf you use the `--syslog` flag then rclone will log to syslog and the\r\n`--syslog-facility` control which facility it uses.\r\n\r\nRclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, eg INFO\r\nwhich makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of\r\ninformation.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/279173611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":958456110,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTU4NDU2MTEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/958456110","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ac1c04137758b2677fe072882e9a7fc0ebe97d72","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/ac1c04137758b2677fe072882e9a7fc0ebe97d72","created_at":"2017-02-11T20:32:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/279231500","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/739#issuecomment-279231500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/739","id":279231500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3OTIzMTUwMA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-12T16:55:19Z","updated_at":"2017-02-12T16:55:19Z","body":"I
