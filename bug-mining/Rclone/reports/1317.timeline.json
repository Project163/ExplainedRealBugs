If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis PR stabilizes the situation of bigger files and multi-threaded uploads.\r\nThe root cause boils down to the old \"fun\" property of pclouds fileops API: sessions are bound to TCP connections.\r\nThis forces us to use a http client with only a single connection underneath.\r\nWith large files, we reuse the same connection for each chunk.\r\nIf that connection interrupts (e.g. because we are talking through the internet), all chunks will fail.\r\nThe probability for latter one increases with larger files.\r\nAs the point of the whole multi-threaded feature was to speed-up large files in the first place, this change pulls the client creation (and hence connection handling) into each chunk.\r\nThis should stabilize the situation, as each chunk (and retry) gets its own connection.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the default buffersize of multi-threaded uploads are not really suitable for this use-case.\r\nFor the use case here, a buffersize equal to the chunk-size would be suitable, as we just want to split the chunks, and can upload those in total. Also, the overhead for each writeAt is quite high, it doesn't make sense to make this smaller.\r\n\r\n> @ncw unfortunatelly, I don't see an \"easy\" way to change the default buffersize when just implementing OpenWriterAt.\r\n> AFAIK, the only way to do it would be to switch to OpenChunkWriter, or is there a way for a backend to change the default of global config?\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n#8147\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2509472255","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8147#issuecomment-2509472255","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8147","id":2509472255,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6Vk4H_","user":{"login":"gfelbing","id":10872874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODcyODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10872874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing","html_url":"https://github.com/gfelbing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfelbing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-30T23:09:07Z","updated_at":"2024-11-30T23:09:07Z","body":"@ncw , I think I found the culprit: We need to pull the client creation into each writeAt, as the client is forced to only hold a single TCP connection, which may be unstable for larger files.\r\nBut at the same time, this increases the overhead for each writeAt, so I would really love to increase the default bufferSize (IMHO even to the same as chunkSize).

:-)\r\n\r\nSo you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nFollow up on #8147\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nLatest master\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nAs @ncw [described it](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8147#issuecomment-2511397636):\r\n\r\n> We don't have a way currently for a backend to give a hint as to what chunk size it prefers for OpenWriterAt only for OpenChunkWriter. It would be easy enough to make one though and I think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nAs far as I see there are two approaches:\r\n\r\n1. Add a way for backends to give hints for buffer size etc. in OpenWriterAt. (Similar to ChunkWriterInfo for OpenChunkWriter)\r\n2. Implement OpenChunkWriter in pcloud.\r\n\r\nIMHO 1/ is more invasive to the code base but cleaner and consistent with the ChunkWriter. Your thoughts @ncw? \r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

Had no issues previously.\n\n#### What is your Android version, phone model and manufacturer?\nAndroid 11, Asus Zenfone 10\n\n#### Which steps are required to reproduce this issue?\n\n  1. Enable local backups with Signal (e.g. to `/local/Signal/backup/`)\n  2. Add pCloud remote on Round-Sync\n  3. Add task to sync `/local/Signal/backup/` to remote `/pCloud/Signal/backup/`\n  4. Run the task\n  5. none of the `.backup` file from Signal was synced (i.e. Nothing to do).\n\nI tried to run this operation with Android Studio (with an without checksum). This is the command used by Round-Sync.\nThis is it:\n```bash\n/data/app/~~dfoUIMsb16rgZKj9xGOZrg==/de.felixnuesse.extract.debug-szLy7nHq_kOmxKVw-3EKdA==/lib/arm64/librclone.so --cache-chunk-path /data/user/0/de.felixnuesse.extract.debug/cache --cache-db-path /data/user/0/de.felixnuesse.extract.debug/cache --config /data/user/0/de.felixnuesse.extract.debug/files/rclone.conf -vvv sync /storage/emulated/0/Backups/Automatic pCloud:/Automatic Back-ups --transfers 1 --stats=1s --stats-log-level NOTICE --use-json-log --checksum\n```\n\nFrom Android Studio I see that the `rclone` process exited with error. This wasn't apparent from the notification in the app.\nThe error message is the following:\n```\n\"msg\":\"Failed to copy: multi-thread copy: failed to open chunk writer: open file: open new file descriptor: pcloud error: Access denied. You do not have permissions to perform this operation.
