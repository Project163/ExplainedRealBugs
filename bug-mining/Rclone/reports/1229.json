this is likely when resync is run when data is already present vs copying the data itself.. There are no changes made to files when moving between a --resync and normal run.  \r\n\r\ndefaults:\r\n\tresync: 10m47.0s\r\n\tnormal: 6m44.7s\r\n\r\ndefaults with ignore checksum: (--ignore-listing-checksum --ignore-checksum)\r\n\tresync: 10m36.5s\r\n\tnormal: 6m31.9s\r\n\r\n### overview\r\n\r\nSo as you can see bisync is orders of magnitude slower than `copy` or `sync` . `ls` is incredibly fast as is `sync` and `copy` in both directions (e.g. uses up almost 100% of bandwidth)\r\n\r\nI only ran the test of `lsl` and `ls` at the very end and now thinking that bisync relies on lsl as this so incredibly slow (as I believe bisync does not use checksum so would need `lsl` info to compare?).\r\n\r\nI can do a local to crypt (local) bisync in 15s (--resync) and 8.7s for subsequent. \r\n\r\nIs there something I am doing wrong? If not, are there plans/options available to rclone to improve the speed of bisync so that it is more in line with 2 x sync/copy commands (e.g. one upload, one download) or is this a limitation that is unlikely to be overcome? Also, if this is due to lsl taking so long is there a way to speed up lsl? \r\n\r\nThanks to you all for your hard work and a special thank you @nielash for all you've been doing on bisync and continue to do. I as many others massively appreciate it and when this tool is out of experimental stages it will be a game changer for so many. If I had any free time or money right now I would help out but unfortunately the best I can do is give you some benchmarks and user feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks ","closed_by":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
