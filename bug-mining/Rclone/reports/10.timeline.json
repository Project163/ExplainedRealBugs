There should be some lines before the backtrace with the actual error.\n\nCan you send everything rclone prints?  If you think it has confidential info in it then you can email it to me privately.\n\nrclone should pick up from where it left off if you retry the transfer.\n\nTo answer your other question, you shouldn't need to set `--modify-window` normally.  Because the various object storage systems and OSes store time to differing accuracies, rclone calculates the modify window which is the time period it expects the date stamps files to agree in.  If you use the `-v` flag you can see rclone calculating the modify window.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/67767843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/67775854","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/17#issuecomment-67775854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/17","id":67775854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3Nzc1ODU0","user":{"login":"zeshanb","id":6672739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzI3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6672739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb","html_url":"https://github.com/zeshanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-21T16:36:15Z","updated_at":"2014-12-21T16:36:15Z","body":"It might not be a bug.
