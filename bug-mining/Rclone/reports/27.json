Basically it is a backup of 2.5GB or so. When I try to do a synchronization, I get a message of duplicate files. Can this be related to that when making the initial copy I have obtained several retries due to have reached the limit for the transfer?\n\nBelow I paste the output from running the command:\n\n```\n# ./rclone copy /space/backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com remote:Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com\n2015/05/19 11:21:16 Google drive root 'Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com': Building file list\n2015/05/19 11:22:16\nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  1m0.49053366s\n\n2015/05/19 11:23:01 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:23:01 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:23:01 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:23:07 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/templates/powermail_33/Partials/Output/Field/Textarea.html: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:23:16\nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  2m0.491802151s\n\n2015/05/19 11:23:35 kg.berlin.to/20150518/tree/typo3temp/pics/4f41c1064a.jpg: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:23:42 kg.berlin.to/20150518/tree/typo3temp/llxml/dialogs.xml_29cd6e9553.default.utf-8.cache: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:23:44 kg.berlin.to/20150518/tree/typo3temp/Cache/Data/l10n/be272a0252aede6cde91be8aa94b9bfa: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:23:49 kg.berlin.to/20150518/tree/typo3temp/Cache/Data/cache_classes/ajaxlogin: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:24:01 kg.berlin.to/20150518/tree/typo3conf/l10n/de/lang/de.locallang_alt_intro.xml: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19 11:24:16\nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  3m0.489234045s\n\n2015/05/19 11:24:49 Google drive root 'Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com': Waiting for checks to finish\n2015/05/19 11:24:49 Google drive root 'Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com': Waiting for transfers to finish\n\nTransferred:       418806 Bytes (   1.90 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:             23383\nTransferred:            1\nElapsed time:  3m35.311200904s\n```\n\nThanks in advance for your reply.\n\nBest regards,\nDaniel\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
