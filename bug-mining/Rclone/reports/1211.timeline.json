I was just reviewing GitHub notifications and found this unread message. I tried the 1.65.0-beta (5824 fix) and it does seem to create substantially fewer connections. **I only saw 20 created connections and 20 closed at the end and did not experience the aforementioned issue when running this in WSL.**\r\n\r\nI'll switch back to the WSL deployment approach using this 1.65.0-beta (5824) version to give it some more 'burn-in' time with further deployments and let you know if I see any regressions. \r\n\r\nRegardless of if this was the underlying issues or a side-effect, it certainly seems like a positive improvement! \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe reason I have some hesitation is I've been using the native 1.64.0 Windows rclone binary with the same flags (`--transfers 20 --checkers 20`) and it is consistently creating a large number of connections –oftentimes closing upwards of 60+ connections by the end– but it doesn't ever hang in Windows like it does in WSL.\r\n\r\nI suspect that Bunny.net itself should be able to handle a fairly substantial number of parallel connections... that being said, I'm not intimately familiar with how WSL2 itself makes those connections and if there's any oddities there that could be contributing. I've had to use other weird workarounds for the WSL2 filesystem when running Docker containers for io intensive containers (eg. Mongodb), so it's certainly possible it's still a parallel connection (or filesystem) thing, but perhaps something unique to WSL2. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Windows 1.64.0 version**\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.64.0\r\n-

My apologies for the late reply. I was just reviewing GitHub notifications and found this unread message. I tried the 1.65.0-beta (5824 fix) and it does seem to create substantially fewer connections. **I only saw 20 created connections and 20 closed at the end and did not experience the aforementioned issue when running this in WSL.**\r\n\r\nThanks for testing.\r\n\r\nI've merged this to master now which means it will be in [the latest beta](https://beta.rclone.org/) in 15-30 minutes and released in v1.65 \r\n \r\n> The reason I have some hesitation is I've been using the native 1.64.0 Windows rclone binary with the same flags (`--transfers 20 --checkers 20`) and it is consistently creating a large number of connections –oftentimes closing upwards of 60+ connections by the end– but it doesn't ever hang in Windows like it does in WSL.\r\n\r\nHmm, that is interesting. I suspect this is an oddity of WSL networking rather than rclone - maybe rclone was overloading it somehow by making too many connections too quickly.\r\n\r\nI'm going to assume that was the case and close this issue, but if you find out otherwise please let me know.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1819523857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11605291751,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M4-9gClzwAAAAKzurLn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/11605291751","actor":{"login":"GerHobbelt","id":402462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjQ2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt","html_url":"https://github.com/GerHobbelt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GerHobbelt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"88bd80c1fa88deab69940672062ed040047049c0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GerHobbelt/rclone/commits/88bd80c1fa88deab69940672062ed040047049c0","created_at":"2024-01-26T06:09:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3342675049","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5824#issuecomment-3342675049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5824","id":3342675049,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M7HPSxp","user":{"login":"microyahoo","id":10202906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAyOTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10202906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo","html_url":"https://github.com/microyahoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/microyahoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-28T09:22:59Z","updated_at":"2025-09-28T09:22:59Z","body":"hi
