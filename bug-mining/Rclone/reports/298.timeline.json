took a stab at implementing a more sophisticated version of this – where you can invalidate specific paths instead of the \"all or nothing\" approach suggested here. That would be a perquisite to hook into the GDrive changes API, for instance.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to solve this in a memory leak free way, though. [bazil/fuse/fs](https://github.com/bazil/fuse/blob/master/fs/serve.go) holds the reference to all nodes (and thus rclone's `Dir`s) in a private map `nodeRefs`. Since I cannot access that map, I cannot simply iterate over its keys until I find a node with a matching path and discard that `Dir`'s `items`.\r\n\r\nIdea 1: Create a lookup `map[string]*Dir`. That might keep `Dir`s around that get removed from the `nodeRefs`, e.g. by `dropNode`. Seems like a very fragile approach to catch all cases to ensure it also gets dropped from rclone's lookup.\r\n\r\nIdea 2: Collect list of invalidated directories and remove it again when the matching directory is re-read. Of course, old entries from that list can be discarded once they are older than `dirCacheTime`. Still, if the idea is to set the dir caching time to essentially ∞, invalidation requests for non-existing dirs would hang around forever.\r\n\r\nIdea 3: Idea 2, but immediately re-read the directory. This would not be flushing, but rather refreshing, but at least it should not leak. \r\n\r\nBoth 2+3 suffer from not working recursively, I think. E.g. if I have `dir1/dir2/file` and invalidate `dir1`, only `dir1` contents will be re-read. `dir2` will not be affected. If that is desired/needed, then it would have to recurse once it is invalidated. Combined with `Dir.rename`, which sets `d.items = nil`, this seems to have a high potential for hard to debug race conditions.\r\n\r\nIdea 4: fork the fuse library and make `nodeRefs` accessible, so that we can iterate. \r\n\r\nNone of the ideas sound really appealing to me, though. If someone has some insight (or spies a mistake in my reasoning), I'd be happy to hear it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/296261012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"breunigs","id":307954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzk1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/307954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs","html_url":"https://github.com/breunigs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/296433354","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/803#issuecomment-296433354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/803","id":296433354,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NjQzMzM1NA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-23T10:21:54Z","updated_at":"2017-04-23T10:21:54Z","body":"@breunigs it seems to me the best approach might be to send a PR to bazil/fuse/fs with the extra functionality rclone needs.

change when a parent directory is renamed. As such, basil/fuse keeps the reference to rclone's `Dir` around, which of course contains the full `path` – this is why it reads `a/b/c` at the end, instead of the expected `a/bb/c`. It is correct on the remote end.\r\n\r\nI will probably solve this alongside #803, but here is in case I don't

comments on this PR:\r\n* I will rebase/squash when this is ready. I expect your review will yield some more changes :)\r\n* fixes #803, and allows fine grained eviction if needed\r\n* I did not need to modify bazil/fuse after all: It already offers a callback through `NodeForgetter` when it discards something on its side. Together with the already implemented rename/remove, this should cover all cases.\r\n* the extra code in `func (d *Dir) rename(…)` is to fix #1375. I experience it when I test manually with GDrive mounted, but I didn't manage to write a failing test case. I'll have to see in #1375 if this is just a bug in GDrive, just not present in the local backend used in test cases or maybe a timing related issue…\r\n* I wonder if SIGHUP is a good signal choice. I would prefer something like SIGUSR1, but if I read [correctly this is not available on Windows](https://github.com/golang/sys/blob/ff24cb3cd86e67842e0d078a5e0cb92d9ffcf8b4/windows/ztypes_windows.go#L51-L84). What about SIGALRM? If not, rclone should probably ignore SIGHUP in other modes, because users might otherwise accidentally kill a running sync if they pass the wrong
