My impression is that this is the most recommended alternative at the moment, supported in OpenSSH since version 6.5 (January 2014): `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`, default filename `id_ed25519`. Supported in golang package `crypto/ed25519` since version 1.13. Marshalled with `MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey` and PEM block `PRIVATE KEY`.\r\n\r\nEdit: I realize now that this is about generating default keys. And *support* for Ed25519 in general seems to be in place already by supplying your own key with argument `--key`.  Pushed a working version to my repo (https://github.com/albertony/rclone/commits/fix-5671-serve-sftp), which generates all three RSA, ECDSA and Ed25519 keys. Do what you want with it. In general it seems Ed25519 should be preferred over ECDSA, considering performance, security, NSA backdoor rumors etc, but the risk of clients not supporting it (yet) is probably higher than with ECDSA. So if only generating RSA and Ed25519 we may risk clients not supporting either of them.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/939463938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5439235202,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M480JUdzwAAAAFENCSC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5439235202","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-10T11:19:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5439235203,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M480JUdzwAAAAFENCSD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5439235203","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-10T11:19:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/939475136","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5671#issuecomment-939475136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5671","id":939475136,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M43_0DA","user":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-10T12:37:55Z","updated_at":"2021-10-10T12:37:55Z","body":"@ncw Your fix breaks on Windows, though.
