You have my blessing to make a new backend for this :-)\r\n\r\nFollow the script here: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-a-new-backend\r\n\r\nNote that s3 isn't a good backend to start from as it is very complicated though I would refer to the code. I'd probably start from one of the simpler bucket based backends like `b2` or `azureblob`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1176065410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6941628326,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M5NGqwrzwAAAAGdwNem","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/6941628326","actor":{"login":"msays2000","id":7993290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTMyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000","html_url":"https://github.com/msays2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-06T10:38:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6941628332,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M5NGqwrzwAAAAGdwNes","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/6941628332","actor":{"login":"msays2000","id":7993290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTMyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000","html_url":"https://github.com/msays2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-06T10:38:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1179484442","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6299#issuecomment-1179484442","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6299","id":1179484442,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5GTYEa","user":{"login":"msays2000","id":7993290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTMyOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000","html_url":"https://github.com/msays2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msays2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-09T05:42:59Z","updated_at":"2022-07-09T05:42:59Z","body":"work
