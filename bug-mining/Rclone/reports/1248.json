We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/rc-endpoint-for-hashsum-download/43965 and a bit indirect, but https://forum.rclone.org/t/core-command-does-not-respect-flags-from-rcd/43970/2\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.65.1\r\n- os/version: darwin 14.2.1 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 23.2.0 (arm64)\r\n- os/type: darwin\r\n- os/arch: arm64 (ARMv8 compatible)\r\n- go/version: go1.21.5\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nThere is no way to do `hashsum --download` in the RC api. `operations/list` and `operations/stat` can do hashes if and only if they are native to the remote. Features such as `--download`, `--base64`, and `--checkfile` (and probably more) are not supported.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, this may fall into the realm of something you can do with rclone but do not need to do it all. You could stream the and compute the hashes and/or compare with a different programming tool but I don't think that is a fair metric.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nAdd this command to the API. Probably something like `operations/hashsum`\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
