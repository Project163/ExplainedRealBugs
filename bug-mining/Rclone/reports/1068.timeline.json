According to the API docs it should be \"/getfilepublink\"?\r\n\r\nI guess that was in the docs in a previous version...\r\n\r\nIt looks like a more sensible URL than `getfilepublink` which is described here: https://docs.pcloud.com/methods/public_links/getfilepublink.html\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately, pCloud does not support rclone. The problem might occur because of it.\r\n\r\nThat wasn't very helpful!\r\n\r\nMaybe you could emphasize that you are trying to use their public
