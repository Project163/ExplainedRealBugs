it took me time to pinpoint the issue\r\nit seem like I have some files that their extension changed from being lowercased to capitalized.\r\nI'm not sure if this was some bug that was fixed in previous issue of rclone or a bug that existed in OneDrive and was fixed but the fact is I have some file on the remote with mismatching file names \r\nfor example -\r\nsome_video.mp4 (local)\r\nsome_video.MP4 (remote)\r\n\r\nwhen rclone copy runs it allways uploads `some_video.mp4` since it does not exist on the remote\r\nbut I guess OneDrive recognizes the `some_video.MP4` exists and just keeps it as is (with the old name) so next time copy will run it will still think `some_video.mp4` is missing and it will upload it again.\r\n\r\nI can manually solve the issue by removing `some_video.MP4` and upload it again, but I have quite a lot of this files and I'm not sure if this won't happen again.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if rclone could detect casing discrepancy without uploading and just fix the file name (according to the copy direction).\r\nIf this is not possible either making sure file name is correct after upload and if not fix it or just ignoring casing all together with one drive would be a lot better.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":954679936,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50OTU0Njc5OTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/954679936","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-08T22:29:07Z","rename":{"from":"--track-renames
