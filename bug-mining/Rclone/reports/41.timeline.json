Use a 3rd party database to store the metadata eg [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) or [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)\n\nAll of these options could potentially work with other cloud providers (eg Microsoft) which don't provide MD5SUMs or Dates.\n\nI think Option 1) would work, but I know from bitter experience that keeping that file up to date will be very complicated and it will be prone to corruption. Using one metadata file per file would work better, but that has the disadvantage that they would all appear in the dropbox interface.\n\nOption 2) fits in well with rclone's philosophy of small and lightweight.

:"But my point was that the json files would only be saved locally and not synced at all - referring to your point:\n\n> Using one metadata file per file would work better, but that has the disadvantage that they would all appear in the dropbox interface.\n\nThe json file can store the same data the datastore currently does (md5 hash etc) to be used for comparison if required. One obvious downside is that the json file(s) would have to be generated on each local instance before syncing could commence.\n\nOr have you considered something like SQLite to store metadata?
