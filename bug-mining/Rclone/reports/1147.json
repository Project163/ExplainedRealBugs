As mentioned by the [docs](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) I tried using the `--interactive` and `--progress` flags. All behavior is working as expected; the issue is the output is...hard to read. (The \"last\" progress display works properly and still updates in place correctly.):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone sync --progress --interactive dropbox:/Books ./Books\r\nTransferred:              0 B / 0 B, -, 0 B/s, ETA -\r\nChecks:              3234 / 3234, 100%\r\nElapsed time:         7.1srclone: copy \"Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edition/Character Sheets/Pregen Characters 1-10/HumanPaladin1-10/Human Paladin 1.pdf\"?\r\ny) Yes, this is OK (default)\r\nn) No, skip this\r\ns) Skip all copy operations with no more questions\r\nTransferred:              0 B / 4.029 MiB, 0%, 0 B/s, ETA -\r\nChecks:              4423 / 4423, 100%\r\nTransferred:            0 / 30, 0%\r\nElapsed time:        11.1s\r\nTransferring:\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…10/Human Paladin 1.pdf: transferring\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…0/Human Paladin 10.pdf: transferring\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…10/Human Paladin 2.pdf: transferring\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…10/Human Paladin 3.pdf: transferring^C\r\n```\r\n_NOTE: The final `^C` is me manually stopping `rclone`\r\n\r\nFurther, the prompt is still responsive, e.g. hitting enter to trigger the default \"Yes\" answer gives me:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone sync --progress --interactive dropbox:/Books ./Books\r\nTransferred:              0 B / 0 B, -, 0 B/s, ETA -\r\nChecks:              2995 / 2995, 100%\r\nElapsed time:         6.7srclone: copy \"Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edition/Character Sheets/Pregen Characters 1-10/HumanPaladin1-10/Human Paladin 1.pdf\"?\r\ny) Yes, this is OK (default)\r\nn) No, skip this\r\ns) Skip all copy operations with no more questions\r\nTransferred:              0 B / 7.520 MiB, 0%, 0 B/s, ETA -\r\nChecks:              4656 / 4656, 100%\r\nTransferred:            0 / 54, 0%\r\nElapsed time:        14.2s\r\nTransferring:\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…10/Human Paladin 1.pdf: transferring\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…0/Human Paladin 10.pdf: transferring\r\nTransferred:      130.059 KiB / 7.494 MiB, 2%, 12.996 KiB/s, ETA 9m40s\r\nChecks:              4983 / 4983, 100%\r\nTransferred:            1 / 54, 2%\r\nElapsed time:        17.2s\r\nTransferring:\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…0/Human Paladin 10.pdf: transferring\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…10/Human Paladin 2.pdf: transferring\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…10/Human Paladin 3.pdf: transferring\r\n * Games/RPGs/D&D 5th Edi…10/Human Paladin 4.pdf: transferring\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.61.1\r\n- os/version: darwin 13.1 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 22.2.0 (arm64)\r\n- os/type: darwin\r\n- os/arch: arm64\r\n- go/version: go1.19.4\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nMac OS X Ventura 13.1 (on Apple M1 Max)\r\n```shell\r\n$ uname -a\r\nDarwin pbohan-<REDACTED> 22.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 22.2.0: Fri Nov 11 02:03:51 PST 2022; root:xnu-8792.61.2~4/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000 arm64\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
