:-) We understand you are having a problem with rclone; we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum:\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\ninstead of filing an issue for a quick response.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.

When i look at my download speed at the time, it starts at 20MB per second and then drops after some time and this seems to correspond with the buffering in plex. \r\n\r\nWhen i remove the --bwlimit in the rclone gui by setting it to an empty value, this behaviour does not occur. There is no buffering and starting a file is near instant. \r\n\r\nI don't understand why this occurs as the only thing being throtteled should be the upload speed and this should have no impact on playing a file that is already uploaded.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nRclone version 1.54\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\n\r\nWindows 10, 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
