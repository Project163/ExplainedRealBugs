We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org/t/request-for-yet-another-cloud-support/31315`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.59.1\r\n- os/version: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 21H1 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 10.0.19043.1889 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: windows\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.18.5\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n\r\nI also use the Linux version: \r\nrclone v1.59.1\r\n- os/version: ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.4.0-84-generic (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.18.5\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nrequesting for a new Storage support called pikpak. The post on forum wasn't from me, but I also want to suggest it.\r\nTheir website is: https://mypikpak.com/\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAdd a new storage support. They seems like have no api for it yet, but [the project mentioned on the forum](https://github.com/alist-org/alist) might be help. It said they [support pikpak](https://alist.nn.ci/guide/) file listing.\r\nThe pikpak website is: https://mypikpak.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
