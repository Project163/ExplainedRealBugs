Edit: Actually the exact value is returned as PublicURI in response, so just need to read that!\r\n- where downloadPublic can be replaced with streamPublic or publicThumb for other features\r\n\r\nThis needs more verification (is it correct, always the case, works for whitelabels etc).\r\nEdit:\r\n- Tested on folders: It will then download it as a zip\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue were spawned from https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5381.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
