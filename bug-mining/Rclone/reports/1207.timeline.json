What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nIn linux, per rclone mount documentation, you simply have to symlink rclone to mount.rclone in order to get it to work with fstab. In FreeBSD the helpers are named mount_helper (in this case, rclone it should be mount_rclone). Unfortunately this does not allow the helper to be called from fstab since it does not detect that it should be in mount helper mode. \r\n\r\nrclone mount <remote> <local> works fine. \r\n\r\nIt seems that possibly mount.rclone and rclonefs are explicitly set / hard coded but mount_rclone is not (for FreeBSD)? \r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.64.0-DEV\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nfreebsd 13.2-release-p4 (64 bit)\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nsmb\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nmount <mountpoint> (derived from /etc/fstab)\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I do not believe there is really anything to log here since FreeBSD does not use the mount.rclone helper and the mount_rclone helper does not work as a helper it just doesn't mount (using fstab). \r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
