And also I have a different case, I use two accounts, one is mine. the other belongs to my wife. So, my account, thats linked to a @hotmail.com account works flawlessly, but my wife's account linked to @outlook.com, gives this error. \r\n\r\nSo the differences between the accounts are:\r\n1 - the liked e-mail, one is @hotmail.com, the other is @outlook.com\r\n2 - My account is the \"Master\" account and my wife's account is \"family member\" that was invited\r\n3 - At the creation of the \"cloud account\" in TrueNas, mine shows only one drive to connect, and my wife's shows four, beeing 2 different repeated 2 times each\r\n\r\nI guess this 2 drivers could be the cause of the problem.... perhaps something related with the age of the account? Because mine is way much older... or could it be due to the association to @outllok.com?\r\n\r\nAs I still have 3 accounts left, i'm thinking in create another, associated with any other e-mail and see what happens...","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2589825026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FernandoRD","id":10245960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ1OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10245960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD","html_url":"https://github.com/FernandoRD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FernandoRD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2619707492","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7405#issuecomment-2619707492","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7405","id":2619707492,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6cJZBk","user":{"login":"anvuongb","id":36110407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTEwNDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36110407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb","html_url":"https://github.com/anvuongb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anvuongb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-28T18:00:48Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T18:00:48Z","body":"Hi all, I came across this thread when searching for solutions to a similar problems.
