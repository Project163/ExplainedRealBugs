The documentation goes on, at extreme length, to list all the regions for the different providers.\r\n\r\nThis is actively harmful to the people maintaining the documentation, and those of us trying to use it.\r\n\r\nExamples include:\r\n1. Users either picked the region(s) when creating their bucket, or will need to be told which region(s) they can use by whichever entity is providing access.\r\n2. Providing an exhaustive list of regions is impractical, maintenance heavy, and will list regions or providers that no longer exist.\r\n3. Third, and worst, it bloats the S3 page (https://rclone.org/s3), so much that it makes it very difficult to actually read it. Especially on Phones/tablets.\r\n\r\nI propose one of the following as a remedy, in personal order of preference:\r\n* Remove it entirely- provide only a handful of examples (in total) from the most prominent regions of the top providers (eg. us-east-1)\r\n* Link to providers' pages of regions\r\n* Move the list of regions to a separate page. This addresses only the difficulty of reading through the main S3 page. It does not reduce documentation maintenance.\r\n\r\nIf approved, I'm willing to provide a PR with the agreed change.\r\n\r\nThanks for the consideration, and hopefully this isn't a better fit for feature request.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
