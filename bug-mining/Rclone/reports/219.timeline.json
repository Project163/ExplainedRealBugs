I should probably have a separate pool for the big file upload chunks then they wouldn't starve the incoming files.\n\nIt might be better to have a separate flag for controlling the concurrency of the large file uploads, as each chunk will take 96MB of memory.  If not set it could default to the number of transfers.  This means that by default B2 might transfer twice `transfers` things at once.\n\nI need to see that error message to work out exactly what is going on - I'm not expecting any sort of timeout - and a full log with `-v` would be very helpful.  Attach it here, or if you are worried about the contents email it privately to nick@craig-wood.com .

I can see clearly the problem you mean.  I think if I do a fix similar to my first comment then it will fix the issues.\n\nI think the issue is mostly cosmetic though - the files not being transferred - the ones you see at 0% will get done eventually.\n\nThe errors I see in your log seems to be all backblaze being overloaded at various points in the transfer - `Failed to copy: c001_v0001000_t0021 is too busy (503 service_unavailable)`.  There isn't a lot rclone can do about that except retry the uploads which it will do eventually (see the `--retries` flag).  The log you sent didn't show a retry so I guess it hadn't quite finished yet.\n\nSo on a retry rclone should retry those 18 files, hopefully successfully.\n\n@marrie \n\n> Waht I normally do is rerun knowing that it won't copy the stuff already there hoping that the larger stuff I do have will copy over.\n> I'd like to see a log with `-v` if possible.\n\nIt might be that you need to increase the value of `--low-level-retries` if big files are failing to upload - that will mean rclone will try harder - the log will show you though.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/247258719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":790331577,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzkwMzMxNTc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/790331577","actor":{"login":"dpedu","id":1266188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjYxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1266188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu","html_url":"https://github.com/dpedu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-15T07:39:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":790331578,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc5MDMzMTU3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/790331578","actor":{"login":"dpedu","id":1266188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjYxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1266188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu","html_url":"https://github.com/dpedu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpedu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-15T07:39:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":790331579,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzkwMzMxNTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/790331579","actor":{"login":"marrie","id":3614487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTQ0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3614487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie","html_url":"https://github.com/marrie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marrie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-15T07:39:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":790331580,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc5MDMzMTU4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/790331580","actor":{"login":"marrie","id":3614487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTQ0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3614487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https
