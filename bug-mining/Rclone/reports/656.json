from the discussion here:\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/supporting-oidc-authentication-for-a-webdav-server/6080\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nI would like to use [OpenID-Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) (OIDC) when authenticating with a webdav server. \r\n\r\nAlthough the latest beta of rclone supports webdav authentication with a bearer token and the OIDC access token may be used as such, I would also like rclone to handle [obtaining the access token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Authentication) from the OIDC Provider (OP) and [refreshing the access token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RefreshTokens) as necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso, ideally rclone would be able to register itself with the OP, provided the OP supports [dynamic client registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html).\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\ndCache\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
