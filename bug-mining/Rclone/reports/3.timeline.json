What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nAdd support for #3572 (public key auth with auth proxy)\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n#3572\r\n\r\nThis is a slight modification of the discussion on the ticket, I made it match the behavior of user/pass when the proxy is involved. Instead of spitting back public keys that are acceptable, the proxy returns a backend config and a zero if the public key is acceptable. I did it this way for two reasons #1 consistency of behavior and #2 I want to be able to log specifics of an auth request and while I definitely don't send user passwords on to logging, I see real value in having the successful or failed public key to help a user debug a connectivity issue.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any concerns or if I've goofed this up somehow, Thanks!\r\n\r\n####

In my testing, a 143-char long original filename ends up as a 231-char long \"encrypted\" filename on a remote with a 255-char real filename length limit.  That's a 44% reduction in usable filename length (255 to 143), which seems quite excessive.\r\n\r\nIsn't there some more reasonable way to encode the filenames without so much space wasted on overhead?  For instance, I think a 20% loss to encoding overhead would be an absolute maximum limit, which would still allow for more than 200-chars of usable filename length compared to the current 143-char limit.  But even with an added 128bits of base64 encoded salt should only take up 22 chars, which should leave 233 chars of filename length usable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3769/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"animosity022","id":5088712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODg3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5088712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022","html_url":"https://github.com/animosity022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-11T21:43:07Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T21:43:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4222","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4222/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4222/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4222/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4222","id":616205303,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MTYyMDUzMDM=","number":4222,"title":"Shortcut remote","user":{"login":"ferferga","id":10274099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjc0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10274099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga","html_url":"https://github.com/ferferga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-05-11T21:37:02Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T23:32:51Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T21:43:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":17803236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzgwMzIzNg==","name":"rclone","full_name":"rclone/rclone","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rclone","id":24937341,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0OTM3MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24937341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone","description":"\"rsync for cloud storage\" -

Which I believe is the recommended way to do it?\r\n\r\nWhen using --vfs-cache-mode write or full, without setting --cache-dir  or -cache-tmp-upload-path,  write caching doesn't work, but everything else works like normal. This is expected and this is OK.\r\n\r\n`/usr/bin/rclone mount GD-TD-ABC-Cached-Xcrypt: /mypool/mount --daemon --fast-list --vfs-cache-mode full --dir-cache-time 60m --allow-other --allow-non-empty -`\r\n\r\nWhen adding  -cache-tmp-upload-path=  (no --cache-dir), write  caching begins to work but not as expected.\r\n\r\nIf I use this command: \r\n\r\n`/usr/bin/rclone mount GD-TD-ABC-Cached-Xcrypt: /mypool/mount --cache-tmp-upload-path=~/fartsOnWheels --daemon --fast-list --vfs-cache-mode full --dir-cache-time 60m --allow-other --allow-non-empty -`\r\n\r\n- **If  ~/fartsOnWheels does not exist.**\r\nThe write caching begins to work.\r\nThe log mentions the given directory.  \r\nLOG:  Upload Temp FS: ~/fartsOnWheels\r\nBut the cache-tmp-upload directory of ~/fartsOnWheels is not obeyed and not created.\r\n- **If  ~/fartsOnWheels does exist.**\r\nThe write caching begins to work.\r\nThe log mentions the given directory.  \r\n LOG:  Upload Temp FS: ~/fartsOnWheels\r\nBut the cache-tmp-upload directory of ~/fartsOnWheels is not obeyed\r\n- **If  instead I give a full path /home/user/fartsOnWheels , it is created if it doesnt exist, otherwise it uses the existing and ...**\r\nThe write caching begins to work.\r\nThe log mentions the given directory.  \r\n LOG:   Upload Temp FS: /home/user/fartsOnWheels \r\nAnd the cache-tmp-upload directory of /home/user/fartsOnWheels is obeyed and fully functional.\r\n\r\n\r\n**_In both first two cases, write caching begins to work, but the temp upload cache dir is automatically instead /home/user/.cache/rclone/vfs/GD-TD-ABC-Cached-Xcrypt/ (part of the vfs cache system!)_**\r\n\r\nNow it turns out that the issue is because of not using full paths and instead using the (tilde glob) ~ character to indicate the user home folder.\r\nIn any case by giving a full path /home/user/fartsOnWheels/ the directly is correctly used.\r\n\r\n**But the plot thickens**, if I put literally anything that isn't a full path, for example --cache-tmp-upload-path=yes it seems to fall back to the same behavior where the temp upload cache dir is /home/user/.cache/rclone/vfs/GD-TD-ABC-Cached-Xcrypt/\r\n\r\n**Something else to note, while this undocumented automatic fallback enables the write cache to function, the files copied during this time for write, while in the undocumented fallback temp upload folder, are never encrypted (or names scrambled) while in this folder, although when they are uploaded fully on the destination they are properly encrypted.**\r\n\r\nExample: File copied to the mount for upload, with the fallback temp active.\r\n--cache-tmp-upload-path=~/fartsOnWheels \r\n\r\n```\r\n ls -la ~/.cache/rclone/vfs/GD-TD-ABC-Cached-Xcrypt/\r\n 2013-cvma-scientific-presentation.pdf\r\n```\r\n(The file name is not scrambled in the temp staging area on disk)\r\n\r\nLOG: INFO  : 6hr4ip2k9c481h9lhmu62tvqm2i4t8pikupd9iqpajfevm4kg49gb3nsb3v5qm9iq1r3e1jce4l3a: background upload: started upload\r\n\r\n\r\n In contrast to a more correctly working full path assigned for  --cache-tmp-upload-path=~/fartsOnWheels\r\n\r\nExample: File copied to the mount for upload, with full path --cache-tmp-upload-path=~/fartsOnWheels\r\n\r\n```\r\nls /tmp/fartsonwheels/\r\n6hr4ip2k9c481h9lhmu62tvqm2i4t8pikupd9iqpajfevm4kg49gb3nsb3v5qm9iq1r3e1jce4l3a\r\n```\r\n(The file name is scrambled in the temp staging area on disk)\r\n\r\nINFO  : 6hr4ip2k9c481h9lhmu62tvqm2i4t8pikupd9iqpajfevm4kg49gb3nsb3v5qm9iq1r3e1jce4l3a: background upload: started upload\r\n\r\nIn either case, the file is uploaded, name scrambled and encrypted correctly on the destination after.\r\n\r\nSo, quite honestly, the fact that the tilde doesn't seem to work for the path for the --cache-tmp-upload-path= could be due to many things, perhaps I need to put it in quotations? I don't know.\r\n\r\nTo be quite honest, the undefined behavior is actually closer to what I was trying to accomplish in the end..\r\nI would prefer that a sane default for cache-tmp-upload-path would be the default, either in the cache-backend folder, or the vfs folder. And by using the tilde glob I was actually trying to put the staging area somewhere in the nearby area a.k.a the next best thing.\r\n\r\nSo, what do I wish would happen?\r\n1. Would be great if the tilde glob was obeyed.\r\n2. A sane default and documented temp upload area based on the defaults for the other cache methods would be great too.\r\n\r\nHope this made sense, it was quite difficult to figure out what was going on and difficult to explain it.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.51.0\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.7\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nDebian 10 Buster\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?

you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a download flag to hashsum and related commands to force rclone to download and hash files locally\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the changes here\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies the operations.hashSum function by adding an alternate code path.  This code path is triggered by passing downloadFlag = True.  When activated, rclone will download files from the remote and hash them locally.  downloadFlag = False preserves the existing behavior of using the remote to retrieve the hash.\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies HashLister to support the new hashSum method as well as consolidating the roles of HashLister, HashListerBase64, Md5sum, and Sha1sum.\r\n\r\nThe unit test operations_test.TestHashSums is modified to support this change and test the download functionality.\r\n\r\nThe command functions hashsum, md5sum, sha1sum, and dbhashsum are modified to support this change.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/force-download-hash/20333\r\n\r\n####

The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/s3-rclone-v-1-52-0-or-after-permission-denied/21961/13\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nInconsistent behavior when using `copy` command for copying a folder as opposed to copying a single file. \r\nThe symptom is that copying a single file fails (but succeeds when copying a folder to the same remote). \r\nThe root-cause is that RCLONE tries to create the remote path (to avoid multiple API calls probably), which means attempting to create a remote *bucket* (a permission that is rarely given when using cloud storage). When that permission isn't given for the user, even if the bucket exists, cloud providers (e.g. S3) will return a \"permission denied\" error. \r\n\r\nThis does not happen when copying a folder, as it seems like RCLONE always tries to list the remote folder prior to trying to copy. So if the bucket exists it will not attempt creating it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions to fix raised by @ncw :\r\n\r\n1. Avoid creating a bucket altogether, unless `mkdir` is used. This is probably not a good idea as it's backwards incompatible.\r\n2. Listing the remote folder prior to copying a single file. This is also a behavior change, as it adds an API call to single file copy operations (how frequent really is that?). Probably the cleanest option (there's the question of handling list permissions... need to look into that and I'll be happy to help).\r\n3. Using the same existing flow (attempt creating remote path, thus implicitly creating the bucket), but doing something different upon retry (assuming the bucket exist maybe). According to Nick, this is probably more complex. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe option #2 is the cleanest, both with respect to consistency with the copy behavior when copying a folder, and avoiding unneeded retries.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nv1.55.0\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nMacOS Catalina 10.15.7 (but I'm sure this behavior is the same)\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?

Intro\r\n\r\nThe bisync pull request #5164 appeared too large to fulfil in a single rclone release.\r\n\r\nPlan is to merge it right after the rclone v1.57 release. The command will be available in the beta builds for a limited circle of beta testers until official release with rclone v1.58.\r\nDuring the beta period we can merge a number of postponed items, **in particular breaking changes**.\r\n\r\nThis ticket will keep track of the most beta time changes. Large and critical changes will be split into separate tickets.\nHigh priority items reflect changes breaking user experience and must be completed before 1.58. Medium priority items are required but not guaranteed by 1.58. Optional and low priority items will be implemented on best effort basis. Optional items don't even have dedicated tickets yet.\r\n\r\n### High priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Track critical flags in saved sessions - #5678\r\n- [ ] Support imprecise or absent modtimes - #5679\r\n- [ ] Use hashsums, honor `--checksum` - #5683\r\n\r\n### Medium priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check file sizes - #5684\r\n- [ ] Respect `--backup-dir` - #5685\r\n- [ ] Align `--max-delete` semantics - #5680\r\n- [ ] Optimize resync - #5681\r\n- [ ] Track renames - #5690\r\n\r\n### Low priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Handle deletion conflicts - #5691\r\n- [ ] Honor `--interactive` and `--auto-confirm`\r\n- [ ] Recover after transient failures - #5676\r\n- [ ] Use **trie** for listings to reduce footprint - #5686\r\n- [ ] Maintain session history - #5692\r\n- [ ] Handle Google Docs better - #5696\r\n\r\n### Optional items\r\n\r\n- [ ] Parallelize move/rename operations\r\n- [ ] Honor special `.rcignore` files\r\n- [ ] Revisit progress display for bisync\r\n- [ ] Handle case-insensitive filenames. Respect `--ignore-case` and `--ignore-case-sync` ([rcsync#54](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/54), [#4854](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4854))\r\n- [ ] Synchronize empty dirs if supported by backend ([rcsync#63](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/63))\r\n- [ ] Fix tests for Google Photos ([rcsync#53](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/53), [G.Photos issues](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Google+Photos%22))\r\n- [ ] Enable CI tests with OwnCloud (according to @cjnaz it's stable)\n- [ ] Test should handle Dropbox \"touch quirks\" in a generic way\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

Synopsis\r\n\r\nThis problem can be also title `recover after transient failures`.\r\n\r\n@cjnaz once wrote in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-843406665\r\n\r\nOne perpetual problem I ran into was with a dynamically changing file system.  rclonesync is not robust for the case of a file no longer there after the current LSL snapshot was taken.  Also, if a file is being written to / blocked when rclonesync wants to copy it.  In such cases rclonesync throws up its hands and forces user interaction via a `--resync`.\r\n\r\n## Prior discussions\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/56\r\nRelated to #1316\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-843426747 (JWink3101)\r\n\r\nI agree with these issues of sorts. This isn't new in rclone either. If you change the filesystem while it is running, things can break. For my tool, I [enumated what would happen](https://github.com/Jwink3101/syncrclone/blob/master/docs/misc.md#interruptions) if it is interrupted. Something similar happens if a file changes.\r\n\r\nBut again, this is the beauty of the not-using-history-to-make-a-changelog approach (\\#2). You only need history to figure out what to do!. So if a file was  added between the lsl, it will still copy.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-843460561 (ivandeex)\r\n\r\nPretty close to #840 (recheck source during operation, open)\r\nRelated to #3770 (_.partial_ file support in LocalFS / FTP / SFTP, which can be _filtered out_ by bisync)\r\n\r\nCovered by postponed item \"Use temporary files with FTP, SFTP\"\r\nI guess it will change nothing in bisync but improve FTP/SFTP and only add related tests to bisync.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-843851607 (ivandeex)\r\n\r\n@cjnaz\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > rclonesync is not robust for the case of a file no longer there after the current LSL snapshot was taken.\r\n\r\nSuch files should be just **skipped** (by default or under a command-line flag) similar to https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5297#pullrequestreview-649944326\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Also, if a file is being written to / blocked when rclonesync wants to copy it.  In such cases rclonesync throws up its hands and forces user interaction via a --first-sync.\r\n>\r\n> Pretty close to #840 (recheck source during operation, open)\r\n> Related to #3770 (_.partial_ file support in LocalFS / FTP / SFTP, which can be _filtered out_ by bisync)\r\n\r\nI think rclonesync approach is right. If bisync detects a mutating file, it should abort operation or just skip the file (depending on a flag e.g. `--force`), then request a resync **and recommend adding this file to a filter.**\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-844237183 (cjnaz)\r\n\r\nOne critical design feature / flaw / weakness of rclonesync is that at the\r\nend of the operation the two paths, and thus the two LSL files must match.\r\nIf not, then the sync has failed and a --first-sync is forced.  So if an\r\nindividual file can't be copied then there is no recovery other than a\r\n--first-sync.  In the future this will be something to be fixed - so that\r\ntransient out-of-sync can be recovered from.  Perhaps track mismatches and\r\nretry in the next run?\r\n\r\n## How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
