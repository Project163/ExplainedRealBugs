Could it be that it is not using the `-fast-list` option with the remote through the union mount point? Maybe it's just a not covered case.\r\n\r\nI notice this because I was getting timeouts with large folders if I mount the union instead the remote.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.46\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux 4.20.8-arch1-1-ARCH x86_64\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
