PR Summary\n\nUnified Command Logging and Go 1.22 Compatibility Improvements\n\n## Overview\n\nThis PR enhances the logging capabilities across multiple commands by implementing a standardized logging approach, fixes compatibility issues with Mega storage for Go 1.22, and improves code consistency and documentation.\n\n## Change Types\n\n| Type         | Description                            |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Enhancement  | Unified logging framework implementation across commands |\n| Enhancement  | Added Mega API compatibility with Go 1.22 |\n| Refactor     | Standardized systemd logging implementation |\n| Refactor     | Transform package type renaming and consistency improvements |\n| Documentation | Updated command help text and markdown formatting |\n\n---\n\n## Affected Modules\n\n| Module / File          | Change Description                       |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| `copy/`, `copyto/`, `move/`, `moveto/` | Added standardized logging capabilities with proper context management |\n| `operations/logger.go` | Added NewDefaultLoggerFn for centralized logging |\n| `operations/operationsflags/` | New package for unified logger configuration |\n| `mega/mega.go`        | Added TLS cipher suite customization for Go 1.22 compatibility |\n| `sync/sync.go`        | Refactored to use standardized logging implementation |\n| `log/systemd_unix.go` | Improved systemd logging with direct journal.Print |\n| `transform/`          | Renamed types for consistency and improved help text generation |\n| `local/local.go`      | Added Windows junction point handling |\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Reviewers\n\n* The Mega storage compatibility fix adds support for an insecure cipher suite (TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256) which is necessary for their API but generally discouraged\n* The logging changes provide consistent behavior across commands while improving resource management\n* Several commands have been updated to use the new centralized logging approach\n\n---\n\n## Additional Context\n\n* Fixes compatibility issue with Mega API in Go 1.22\n* Provides a consistent logging framework for command operations\n* Improves cross-platform consistency with Windows junction point handling","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeOwlAI/rclone/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeOwlAI/rclone/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18717543005,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M68fl23zwAAAARbpwpd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/18717543005","actor":{"login":"nha","id":1968291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1968291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha","html_url":"https://github.com/nha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-20T18:10:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18840884371,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M68fl23zwAAAARjARST","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/18840884371","actor":{"login":"log2","id":943848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0Mzg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/943848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2","html_url":"https://github.com/log2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/log2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-27T17:05:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
