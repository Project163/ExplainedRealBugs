Ideas?\r\n\r\nSo I think a --graceful termination would require disabling the max transfer logic in `fs/accounting/accounting.go` and something like in `fs/sync/sync.go` in `pairCopyOrMove` looking for the total transfer and discarding any files from the pipe from that point.  This will empty the transfer queue and rclone will come to a halt gracefully.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this approach\r\n- only works for sync/copy/move - the current approach works for any rclone command\r\n- emptying the transfer pipeline won't stop the reading/checking pipeline so rclone may do more work than is necessary - fixing this may be hard!\r\n\r\nNeither of those are show-stoppers as long as they are documented.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/447309732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/457381260","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2672#issuecomment-457381260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2672","id":457381260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzM4MTI2MA==","user":{"login":"BinsonBuzz","id":24946073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTQ2MDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24946073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz","html_url":"https://github.com/BinsonBuzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BinsonBuzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T22:24:08Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T22:24:08Z","body":"Hi

interesting idea..\r\n\r\nSo we might have 3 modes for `--max-transfer`\r\n- hard cutoff at the limit (current)\r\n- graceful stop after the limit is reached\r\n- graceful stop before the limit is reached\r\n\r\nI also have a patch for `--max-duration` which could use the same features.\r\n\r\nSo I propose a new flag `--cutoff-mode` with the following options\r\n- `hard` - stop immediately the limit is reached\r\n- `soft` or maybe `graceful` - finish existing transfers and finish when the limit is reached\r\n- `cautious` - try to stop before the limit is reached\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/546619780/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2746174064,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc0NjE3NDA2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2746174064","actor":{"login":"Saviq","id":231077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTA3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/231077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq","html_url":"https://github.com/Saviq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-26T16:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2746174065,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NDYxNzQwNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2746174065","actor":{"login":"Saviq","id":231077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTA3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/231077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq","html_url":"https://github.com/Saviq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Saviq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-26T16:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2757349168,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NTczNDkxNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2757349168","actor":{"login":"20051231","id":7580419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODA0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7580419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231","html_url":"https://github.com/20051231","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/20051231/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6067cfa21034067d0625d35246941cbc190e8da3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/20051231/rclone/commits/6067cfa21034067d0625d35246941cbc190e8da3","created_at":"2019-10-30T19:24:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"20051231","id":7580419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODA0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7580419?v=4","gra
