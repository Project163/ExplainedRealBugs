Unfortunately the official Dropbox desktop client\n> doesn't use the Dropbox API, and the client is substantially more\n> complex and works somewhat differently, so it's difficult to draw a\n> direct comparison here.\n> \n> Also, note that all of the Dropbox servers are located in the US. Your\n> connection speed to Dropbox depends on the routing you get between your\n> ISP and our servers, and may be slower than your ISP's rated speeds.\n> \n> Sometimes resetting or retrying your connection gets you a different\n> route and better speeds, but that is outside of our control. Some ISPs\n> also throttle sustained connections so if you see an initial high\n> connection speed followed by lower speeds, that could be the reason.\n> \n> We're always working on improving our infrastructure, but otherwise, as\n> user or developer, there's not much else you can do to change the\n> overall speeds you get, which depends on many different factors.\n> \n> Sorry I don't have a more straightforward answer here!\n\nSo I think this probably isn't an rclone problem.\n\nI tried again at work (we are an ISP) where we have a 10 Gbit/s direct to the London Internet Exchange and I got the same result a measly 64kB/s upload speed.\n\nI'm sure that dropbox has worked faster in the past.\n\nIt seems to be limited to 64kB/s per file, so if I transfer 4 files at once I can get 256 kB/s transfer speed which is better but still not brilliant.\n\nI'm following up with Dropbox support for more

dropbox backend is working, but uploads are currently slow (tag v2.0.1.21-2.0.1.21_experimental_2016-09-09). This is in my opinion caused by the chunked upload, with chunk size defaulting to Utility.Utility.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE that is currently only 64 KiB. \n\nAccording to this post: https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/103#issuecomment-134688176 , at 64 KiB chunks we can only expect roughly 80 KiB/s uploads, due to the api-overhead.
