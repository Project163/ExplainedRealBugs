Good news is that my ODfB doesn't create a new version for empty files on modtime change. Bad news is that non-empty files remain problematic. :/","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/418427375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cnly","id":3103188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly","html_url":"https://github.com/Cnly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/418438438","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2520#issuecomment-418438438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2520","id":418438438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODQzODQzOA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-04T16:46:01Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T16:46:01Z","body":"Nice one!

What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n1.51.0\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n[It is documented](https://rclone.org/onedrive/) that onedrive creates multiple versions of the files uploaded through rclone, using double or even more of the storage quota. The rclone docs mention that this is only a problem with `rclone copy`, however I just did an `rclone sync` to upload ~30k files to onedrive and every document has at least two versions, separately taking storage quota. \r\n\r\nIt is not possible to disable file versioning unless you are a SharePoint admin, and Microsoft only provides a way to remove the versions file-by-file.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThe SharePoint .NET API allows the removal of older versions, as [in this project](https://github.com/balassy/OneDriveVersionCleaner). However I could not get this to compile under dotnet core in Linux, possibly because [the specific SharePoint library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/complete-basic-operations-using-sharepoint-client-library-code) requires additional Windows dll-s. Nevertheless I think that there might be a way to interface with this API through rclone.
