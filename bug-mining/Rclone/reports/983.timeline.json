Killing rclone with any other signal will likely exit with 128+signum (though is the done by the shell? not sure).\r\n\r\nIf a process handles signals on its own it can implement whatever it wants. That's the case of rclone for SIGINT/SIGTERM on Unix systems.\r\n\r\nIf a program is terminated by a signal, either by the default handler or because it can't be caught (SIGKILL, etc.), the shell will assign the exit code to 128 + N after it got the signal number from `waitpid` or a related function.\r\n\r\n> I think on balance 128+signum is fine, with the proviso that we discover what that does on Windows!\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of this before, but [Windows doesn't have signal numbers](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30328#issuecomment-465624861). The PR I'm going to push shortly handles this such that on Windows the exit status upon a signal is always 2 (uncategorized error).

Windows.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/874346389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hansmi","id":3238454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3238454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi","html_url":"https://github.com/hansmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"hansmi","id":3238454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3238454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi","html_url":"https://github.com/hansmi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hansmi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-05T22:04:07Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T22:04:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5445","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5445/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5445/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5445/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5445","id":937385163,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjgzOTUwMzU2","number":5445,"title":"Terminate
