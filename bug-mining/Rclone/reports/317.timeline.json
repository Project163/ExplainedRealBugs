Since we are looking for a pure go implementation there are not many other options [goleveldb](https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb), [tiedot](https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/tiedot) will probably work but leveldb feels like it will require more bootstrapping and tiedot doesn't seem as mature (both has seem to be a lot less popular than bolt).\r\n\r\nSo I think bolt should be the better choice but I never worked with any of the above some I'm open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nAs with which data to save -\r\nhash \r\nModification time \r\nfile name (absolute path)\r\n\r\nI think this is the bare minimum we need to save for anything useful. I'll think of a proper schema and upload it here once I have it a bit more finalized but i think of some relation between remotes might be useful.\r\n\r\nI haven't done the schema yet but having the hash as one of the keys will probably be very useful. this means that we need to make sure it is unique and though SHA1 might be good enough I would much rather go with SHA256 but that might be a bit expensive to store and calculate especially for large files ( hashes being calculated for verifying the remote file would still be saved for cache and for verifying the remote file hasn't changed )  \r\nIf SHA256 is much less common than SHA1 with the remotes it might be worth using it and taking the almost non existent risk of collision \r\n\r\nWhen storing file path we still need to take into consideration that files might move on local filesystem/remote  #1331\r\n\r\nWe need to see how we handle dedupe files since they obviously going to have the same hash but might change independently in future runs\r\n\r\nVersioning for db/records it might be useful to version the meta data so if we have any future schema changes migration wont be an issue\r\n\r\nWe need to see where to store the database file itself. rclone config path is probably the best place but we might want to offer a cmd flag to change the default\r\n\r\nThere are probably some more considerations I'm forgetting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1336/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/294456819","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1331#issuecomment-294456819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1331","id":294456819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NDQ1NjgxOQ==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-17T11:12:58Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T11:12:58Z","body":"That
