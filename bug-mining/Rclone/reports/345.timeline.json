created [Yandex Disk](https://disk.yandex.com/) cloud storage backend for rclone.\n\nAlready working:\n- rclone opetations: copy, sync, ls, lsl(size, md5, modificationTime)\n- uploading/downloading/removing/listing files\n- creating directories\n\nI've tested syncronization and copying to and from the cloud a bit\n\nNot working yet:\n- lsd operation (will add later)\n- empty folders not created/removed yet\n\nNeeded:\n- no documentation yet\n- not everything is covered with unit tests\n- maybe api part need some refactoring\n\nI will cleanup code and posting it a bit later.\n\nIf you're interested, I think you need to register oAuth app with Yandex Disk https://tech.yandex.com/oauth/  for rClone.\n\nAs of today I think Yandex Disk offering somwhere about 10Gb for free.

some odd behavior regarding folders with Google drive:\n\nrclone version: v1.27\nsystem: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS x86_64\n#### Issue 1: --dry-run created a folder\n\nThe command `rclone --dry-run sync TestFolder/ gdrive:TestFolder`\ncreated an empty `TestFolder` on my Google Drive. Here is the Drive Activity log:\n\n```\nYou created an item in\nrclone • 4:49 PM\nGoogle Drive Folder\nMy Drive\nGoogle Drive Folder\nTestFolder\n```\n\nBut since this was a `--dry-run`, I expected only a **report** that `TestFolder` would be created.\n#### Issue 2: empty folders not deleted after sync\n\nAfter properly creating `TestFolder` and its hierarchy on Drive with \n\n```\nrclone sync TestFolder/ gdrive:TestFolder\n```\n\nmy Drive Activity log shows creation of files and the subfolder `test folder 2` (as expected):\n\n```\nYou created an item in\nrclone • 5:02 PM\nGoogle Drive Folder\nTestFolder\nText\ntest.txt\n\nYou created an item in\nrclone • 5:02 PM\nGoogle Drive Folder\ntest folder 2\nText\ntest2.txt\n\nYou created an item in\nrclone • 5:02 PM\nGoogle Drive Folder\nTestFolder\nGoogle Drive Folder\ntest folder 2\n```\n\nBut then I delete the contents of `TestFolder` on my local system:\n\n```\ncd TestFolder; rm -rf *\n```\n\nand resync with \n\n```\nrclone sync TestFolder/ gdrive:TestFolder\n```\n\nI belive this should leave an empty `TestFolder` on my Drive, but the Activity log shows only:\n\n```\nYou permanently deleted 2 items\nrclone • 5:11 PM\nText\ntest2.txt\nText\ntest.txt\n```\n\nand leaves behind the folder `test folder 2` even though it was deleted locally.\n\nIf if do: `rclone -v ls gdrive:TestFolder` I get:\n\n```\n2016/02/06 17:26:39 Google drive root 'TestFolder': Modify window is 1ms\n2016/02/06 17:26:39 Google drive root 'TestFolder': Reading test folder 2/\n2016/02/06 17:26:39 Google drive root 'TestFolder': Finished reading test folder 2/\n2016/02/06 17:26:39 Google drive root 'TestFolder': Finished reading \n```\n\nso rclone is seeing the left-behind empty folder `test folder 2`; this is verified also with lsd:\n\n```\nrclone lsd gdrive:TestFolder\n-1 2016-02-06 22:02:16        -1 test folder 2\n```\n\nBut I expected rclone to delete the empty folder `test folder 2`\n\nI encountered this while syncing a number of local folders after some local changes. \n\nLet me know if I am missing something... \n\nBut thanks for a great tool; better than other options!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/342/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/182503918","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/100#issuecomment-182503918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/100","id":182503918,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MjUwMzkxOA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T17:57:58Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T17:57:58Z","body":"I

The reason that I have for this:\n\nIn my use case, I use Amazon Cloud Drive to store home camera data (videos/jpgs) from my home's automation.  I store everything in directories sort of like this:\n\n/cams/<cameraname>/2016-02-01\n/cams/<cameraname>/2016-02-02\n/cams/<cameraname>/2016-02-03\n/cams/<cameraname>/2016-02-04\n/cams/<cameraname>/2016-02-05\n\netc.  So daily folders for each camera.  In the GUI, when I send a folder to the trash, it literally sends the folder to the trash and if I were to try to purge that folder or even restore that folder it would be VERY simply to do.  i.e. select the folder and restore/delete depending on my wishes.\n\nIF I perform the deletes via RCLONE, It deletes and puts in the trash up with tens of thousands of individual files contained in those folders.  Good luck trying to restore them when they are all intermixed with different days/cameras. and there is no method available in amazon cloud drive to 'purge trash' (It needs to be done in batches of 1000 and takes a long time via the GUI).\n\nIt would be more efficient to have rclone delete the contents or folder depending on what you specify.  Like this:\n\nThis could delete individual files\nrclone -delete robacd:/cams/playroom/2016-03-29/\\* \nOR\nrclone -delete robacd:/cams/playroom/2016-03-29/\n\nThis could delete the FOLDER itself (no trailing slash and/or no star)\nrclone -delete robacd:/cams/playroom/2016-03-29\n\nThanks for the great tool.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/213017441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calisro","id":5018276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTgyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5018276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro","html_url":"https://github.com/calisro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/213758692","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/100#issuecomment-213758692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/100","id":213758692,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzc1ODY5Mg==","user":{"login":"Wowfunhappy","id":4484096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODQwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4484096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy","html_url":"https://github.com/Wowfunhappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wowfunhappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-23T15:25:28Z","updated_at":"2016-04-23T15:25:28Z","body":"Perhaps this should be split into two separate tickets?
