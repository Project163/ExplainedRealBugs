looked into a synchronous `release`, but as far as I can tell the best approach was a patchset from around 2014 that introduced this feature – it didn't get merged into the kernel, so, no dice.\r\n\r\nHere's another idea: create a 0 byte file when trying to flush an unwritten handle. Only once of course, unless a write happens – which then would behave like it does not and possibly overwrite a file of the same name. Obvious downside is the extra request even when not needed (for sure when using a pipe, possibly other cases). It would also most likely fix `rsync`, for better or worse.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/329998026/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"breunigs","id":307954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzk1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/307954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs","html_url":"https://github.com/breunigs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1272752328,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTI3Mjc1MjMyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1272752328","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-30T13:33:38Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.38"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1272752329,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEyNzI3NTIzMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1272752329","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-30T13:33:38Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.39"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1419833950,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTQxOTgzMzk1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1419833950","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-11T14:05:42Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.39"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1419833951,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE0MTk4MzM5NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1419833951","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_

the forum thread [Extracting to ACD mount possible?](https://forum.rclone.org/t/extracting-to-acd-mount-possible/4161) I'm now creating this issue.\r\n\r\nI found a race condition involving multiple open `*vfs.RWFileHandle`'s for one file.\r\n\r\nThis is a log containing a failed upload: [rclone_extract_ptr_empty.log](https://gist.github.com/B4dM4n/2aecfd06a48d2099df768ec46af69889#file-rclone_extract_ptr_empty-log). The state after this log is the following:\r\n- Test/JD/rand4/rand.bin size=0 mtime=2018-01-29 21:25:18.826 +0100 (mtime of the source)\r\n- Test/JD/rand4/rand.bin size=0 mtime=2018-01-30 14:46:04.??? +0100 (mtime of upload time)\r\n\r\nI assume the problem is `*vfs.RWFileHandle.close()` not being synchronized between multiple files.\r\nThe log file above shows two `close()` executing in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe first `RWFileHandle` belongs to a new empty file. The second one the handle being written to. During the `close()` of the first handle, the empty cache file gets `Move`'ed to the backend. After the move is completed the cache file get's deleted.\r\nWhen the second `close()` tries to move the cache file, which is already gone.\r\n\r\nThis could also be related to #1181.\r\n\r\nI think, `close()` should check whether there is another `RWFileHandle` opened for it's file. Hopefully this fixes the race condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.39-096-gcf6d522d\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux 4.14.13-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Jan 10 11:14:50 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using?
