The problem / bug is that http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth is not unique - any user on a shared platform can connect\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that URL needs to be configured at box as the redirection URL so it isn't possible to change it on the fly.\r\n\r\nI managed to replicate this.\r\n\r\nI notice that when you start the second rclone and get to the webserver prompt you get this and rclone stops\r\n\r\n```\r\nUse auto config?\r\n * Say Y if not sure\r\n * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine\r\ny) Yes\r\nn) No\r\ny/n> y\r\n2019/09/27 13:52:00 Failed to start auth webserver: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:53682: bind: address already in use\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever rclone has already opened the browser window at that point and popped it to the front.\r\n\r\nSo I propose two fixes\r\n\r\n1. open the browser window after we have successfully started the oauth server\r\n    - this would have fixed the problem on its own\r\n2. check the unique state in the auth redirect is correct\r\n    - this would also have fixed the problem on its own\r\n\r\nCan you have a go with this fix and see if it fixes it for you?\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.rclone.org/branch/v1.49.3-101-gda77b2d0-fix-3573-auth-beta/ (uploaded in 15-30

What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nRclone 1.50.0 introduced a mitigation to #3573, requiring a new ```state``` parameter for rclone config, rclone config create and rclone authorize. \r\n\r\nThis breaks third party integrations like rcloneExplorer which used to redirect users to ```http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth```. Unfortunately, this change also wasn't documented in the change log.\r\n\r\nCould you add a flag to allow the user to supply an authentication token or the whole auth url?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.50.0\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.7\r\n```\r\n(built from source)\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nany\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
