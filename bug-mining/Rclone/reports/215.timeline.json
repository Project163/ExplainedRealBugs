It is because the crypt remote didn't have a bucket specified. I think it was copying the files locally instead. So human error, but perhaps an enhancement would be to warn about locally copied files, missing buckets or something similar.\n\nI've left my thought process below in any case:\n\n---\n\nI agree it looks like there was a transfer. For the whole lot to finish within a second makes me think that nothing was transferred.\n\nThe web interface shows no files in the etc2 directory and no additional buckets or directories having been created.\n\nInterestingly, `rcclone ls secret:flibble/etc2` does show all the files (and returns instantly, like it's not actually connecting to a remote host):\n\n> ```\n>     8 hostname\n>    18 subuid\n>  1078 group-\n>    12 debian_version\n> 67946 mailcap\n>  1094 group\n>   436 hosts.sbak\n> ```\n> \n> ...\n\nBut doing `rclone ls remote:flibble/etc2` shows nothing (and takes a few seconds):\n\n> ```\n>     0 .bzEmpty\n> ```\n> \n> 2016/09/06 10:35:49 \n> Transferred:      0 Bytes (0 Bytes/s)\n> Errors:                 0\n> Checks:                 0\n> Transferred:            0\n> Elapsed time:        2.5s\n\nIn the definition of the crypt remote, no, I did not specify the bucket. However, as I'm doing it on the command line (the bucket name being flibble) should this make a difference? I certainly don't see any additional buckets having been created. [and then I created a new crypt remote and it worked]\n\n---\n\nMany thanks for your help here, and it looks like the transfer and sha1 issue is fully resolved as I see properly encrypted files, with encrypted filenames, in B2 now.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/244902322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bittylicious","id":15180124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTgwMTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15180124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious","html_url":"https://github.com/bittylicious","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bittylicious/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/244918596","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/686#issuecomment-244918596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/686","id":244918596,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDkxODU5Ng==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T11:05:47Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T11:05:47Z","body":"Ah, so you put as your remote in `remote` rather than `remote:` or `remote:bucket`.
