are two pCloud APIs a JSON one an a binary one.  Rclone uses the JSON API maybe the Native App uses the binary one?\r\n\r\nI think this is probably a bug in the pCloud JSON API not accepting negative numbers for the mtime. Its possible that if rclone sent the number as an unsigned 64 bit number it would work (that would make sense if it works with the binary API)...\r\n\r\nI tried this and it worked in my testing so can you give it a go?\r\n\r\n[v1.58.0-beta.5935.48d55d6fa.fix-5917-pcloud-mtime](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-5917-pcloud-mtime/v1.58.0-beta.5935.48d55d6fa.fix-5917-pcloud-mtime/) on branch [fix-5917-pcloud-mtime](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/tree/fix-5917-pcloud-mtime) (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nThis sends the negative timestamps as a very large positive number 18446744073678057256 which interpreted as a signed 64 bit number is -31494360. This seems to workaround the bug!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1015323035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6179786088,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M5Bzl03zwAAAAFwWA1o","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/6179786088","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2339172df2ee82cb65df5bc9ba837ab5cf65ea29","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/2339172df2ee82cb65df5bc9ba837ab5cf65ea29","created_at":"2022-03-03T17:20:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1058289367","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5917#issuecomment-1058289367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5917","id":1058289367,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M4_FDbX","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-03T17:20:40Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T17:20:40Z","body":"I've

What is the problem you are having with rclone?\n\nWhen using rclone copy between two ntfs-3g path/device, very old dates changes to a future date which shows difference between the 2 files every time it runs.\n\nLike from file modification date on source 1665.12.01. it changes to 2250.06.22. on destination files.\nThat means every time I run a dry-run or live copy, it recognise the difference and trying to modify dates again but it fails....\n\nI tested with midnight commander, rsync. Both transfers date like 1665.12.01. flawlessly between those 2 path.\n\n\nFor reference, related similar issue that I found and where I asked about it: \nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5917\n\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n```\n❯ rclone version\nrclone v1.71.0\n- os/version: cachyos (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 6.16.4-4-cachyos (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.24.6\n- go/linking: dynamic\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\n```\n❯ mount\n/dev/sdd1 on /mnt/usb/wd-feher/backup type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096)\n/dev/sda2 on /mnt/ntfs-fix/k type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096,x-gvfs-show)\n```\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n```\n❯ uname -a\nLinux cachyos-x8664 6.16.4-4-cachyos #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed, 03 Sep 2025 14:45:16 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n```\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
