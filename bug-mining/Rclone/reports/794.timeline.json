I have fixed this properly here\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.rclone.org/branch/v1.51.0-303-gc0755056-fix-3728-config-obscure-beta/ (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nThis has updated docs and two new flags - let me know if this works for you! It is also available over the rc.\r\n\r\n      --no-obscure   Force any passwords not to be obscured.\r\n      --obscure      Force any passwords to be obscured.\r\n\r\n> If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will\r\n> automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before\r\n> putting them in the config file.\r\n> \r\n> **NB** If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and\r\n> consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about\r\n> whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured\r\n> passwords into the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that\r\n> the passwords get obscured then use the \"--obscure\" flag, or if you\r\n> are 100% certain you are already passing obscured passwords then use\r\n> \"--no-obscure\".  You can also set osbscured passwords using the\r\n> \"rclone config password\" command.\r\n>
