Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.51.0\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3851#issuecomment-595398764 for the rationale/use case.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\n`vfs/refresh` should be updated to also refresh disk space usage. Alternatively, a new, separate `vfs/*` interface can be added to do the same thing.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/595843987","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3851#issuecomment-595843987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3851","id":595843987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTg0Mzk4Nw==","user":{"login":"1xe","id":26555253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU1MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26555253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe","html_url":"https://github.com/1xe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1xe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-06T16:19:35Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T16:19:35Z","body":"> > I think it makes sense that disk space usage is tied to the directory cache and that if `rclone rc vfs/refresh` updates the directory cache, then disk space usage is updated as well.
