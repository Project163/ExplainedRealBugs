Maybe it's a character encoding issue? I tested the URI path characters from [https://dev.onedrive.com/misc/path-encoding.htm](https://dev.onedrive.com/misc/path-encoding.htm), and when OneDrive replaces invalid characters like ~ with ～, rclone doesn't seem to print those codepoints correctly (`～` shows as `я╜Ю` in terminal). I haven't figured out exactly what's going on, but I've forked the project and I'll do some digging when I have time.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/240586098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"devinkwok","id":6848383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDgzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6848383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok","html_url":"https://github.com/devinkwok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinkwok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/240670403","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/620#issuecomment-240670403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/620","id":240670403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDY3MDQwMw==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T09:24:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T09:24:34Z","body":"This is probably related to #218 .\n\nThe `+` being translated to ` ` means that it is to do with URL encoding going wrong.\n\n> when OneDrive replaces invalid characters like ~ with ～\n\nIt is rclone doing those replacements.
