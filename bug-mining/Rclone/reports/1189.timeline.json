This was the simplest way I could think of that should have desired effect. \r\n\r\nLimitations include this forcing the dialer to make tcp connections only. This shouldn't be problem for `net/http` since HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are tcp only .\r\nI might have also missed other problems with this approach.\r\n\r\nAlternative ways of achieving this is modifying address resolution probably by providing a custom resolver to the dialer.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution
