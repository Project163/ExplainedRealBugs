The Azure blob stores I use are littered with these \"Hot\" blobs. `rclone` invariably copies the file-looking one (even though Azure says it's a \"folder\"), and not the folder and its contents.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/clapper-stuff/blob-store.png\"/>\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nTested with the following versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.44\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.45-011-gba8aa73a-fix-2654-azureblob-client-beta\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.44\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nMac OS 64-bit\r\nUbuntu 14.04 (trusty) 64-bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
