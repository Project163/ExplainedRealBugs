a relatively new user of rclone - apologies if this is a silly question, but I didn't see an answer in the searches I tried...\n\nhttp://rclone.org/dropbox says:\n\n> Dropbox doesn’t have the capability of storing modification times or MD5SUMs so syncs will effectively have the `--size-only` flag set.\n\nWhat makes you believe that Dropbox doesn't store modification times?  My experience - with Dropbox's own sync program, on Linux - is that it does indeed store/preserve mod times, to a precision of 1 second on sync'd copies.  Is that metadata not available through the interface that rclone uses?\n\nI'm using rclone v1.26 on Fedora 21 64-bit.  `rclone copy`  from a local file to Dropbox doesn't preserve mod time -- if it's a new file, the mod time is the time of the copy.  I assume that's due to the implied `--size-only` option..?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T17:42:12Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T17:42:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/349","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/349/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/349/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/349/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/349","id":132769026,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMzI3NjkwMjY=","number":349,"title":"Implement dropbox v2 api -
