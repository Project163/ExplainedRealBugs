What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nrclone v1.50.2\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.8\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nCurrently, rclone uses the `b2_copy_file` API call to update the metadata element containing the file's modification.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation appears to use the following process:\r\n- `b2_list_file_names`  -- for the single file, to obtain the B2 fileId of the current version\r\n- `b2_copy_file` -- to create a new version of the file with the same content but new metadata.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that both of these calls are Class \"C\" transactions in B2 -- the most expensive category.\r\n\r\nRe-uploading the file would be \"free\" Class \"A\" transactions.  The \"cost\" would be upload bandwidth and time.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I can avoid the issue via `--no-update-modtime`, but run the risk of not updating content if the modification time changes but the size does not.   \r\n\r\nUsing `--checksum` ensures that content is updated and there is value in running a checksum based synchronization run occasionally to ensure the content is accurate, but it is an \"expensive\" operation \r\nif either the source or destination do not store a checksum in the metadata.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nI see several possibilities, and would defer to others regarding the best approach.\r\n\r\n- Provide an option to disable all b2 copy operations.\r\n- Provide an option to disable b2 copy operation only for modification updates.\r\n- Provide an option to only use b2 copy if a file is above a minimum size, allowing the balance to be determined on a individual process basis.\r\n\r\nSome of the options could assist with #3991 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4037/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/615921547","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3991#issuecomment-615921547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3991","id":615921547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTkyMTU0Nw==","user":{"login":"Hescominsoon","id":63925629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTI1NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63925629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon","html_url":"https://github.com/Hescominsoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hescominsoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-18T18:28:31Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T19:05:28Z","body":"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_copy_part.html\r\n\r\nAlso this error i am seeing as part of FeeNAS cloud sync(which uses rclone).
