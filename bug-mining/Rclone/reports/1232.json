Synposis\r\n\r\nClearly explain in documentation whether `--resync` is asymmetrical.\r\n(@cjnaz could you comment?)\r\n\r\nInvestigate whether `--resync` can be re-implemented by the equivalent of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone copy --update Path1 Path2\r\nrclone copy --update Path2 Path1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Prior discussions\r\n\r\n## optimize --resync\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/66 (eric-void) -> (cjnaz)\r\n\r\n> looking at the code there is a lot of work to copy Path2 files not in Path1, and then do an \"rclone sync\" from Path1 to Path2. Why don't you just do and \"rclone copy\" from Path1 to Path2, and then an \"rclone copy\" from Path2 to Path1?\r\n> This is much simpler, there is no need to read 2 times LSL files and to loop for missing Path2 files, and the result should be the same. Am i missing something?\r\n\r\nThe first-sync optimization is deferred for now since its not broke and should be rarely run.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#discussion_r688913159 (ncw)\r\n\r\nSo `--resync` is asymetrical?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better implemented by the equivalent of\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone copy --update Path1 Path2\r\nrclone copy --update Path2 Path1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
