This would explain why the goroutines aren't being freed.\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\nI'm currently building it myself to debug the issue so that's the latest `master` commit:\n\n```\nrclone v1.70.0-beta.8745.15510c66d\n- os/version: alpine 3.21.3 (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 5.15.0-140-generic (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.24.3\n- go/linking: static\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\n\nAmazon S3 Object Storage\n\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\n```bash\nrclone mount config-name:/my-bucket /data \\\n  --config=/config/rclone.conf \\\n  --uid=1000 \\\n  --gid=1000 \\\n  --cache-dir=/cache \\\n  --use-mmap \\\n  --allow-other \\\n  --umask=002 \\\n  --rc \\\n  --rc-no-auth \\\n  --rc-addr=:5574 \\\n  --rc-enable-metrics \\\n  --vfs-cache-mode writes \\\n  --allow-non-empty\n```\n\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
