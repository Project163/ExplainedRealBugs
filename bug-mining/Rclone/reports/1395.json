However, I don't want to have to type this argument whenever I'm using rclone.  Instead, I would like to have this option as part of my rclone configuration for this remote.\n\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\n\nThe configuration file could accept an extra option, `ca_cert` perhaps.\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
