The \"users/myusername\" part and the URL was not obvious and I needed some time to find it out.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/647009613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Frank-Buss","id":55055211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDU1MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55055211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss","html_url":"https://github.com/Frank-Buss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frank-Buss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/649093165","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1069#issuecomment-649093165","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1069","id":649093165,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTA5MzE2NQ==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T21:53:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T21:53:44Z","body":"Do you want to have a go at adding it to the docs @Frank-Buss ?

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis adds support for the cloud storage technology HiDrive as a new backend called `hidrive`.\r\nIt directly uses the [HiDrive REST API](https://developer.hidrive.com/http-api-reference/), offering access to more features and better usability, as opposed to connecting rclone to HiDrive via webdav, etc.\r\nAs the API is the same for [HiDrive by STRATO](https://www.strato.de/cloud-speicher/) and [HiDrive by IONOS](https://www.ionos.de/office-loesungen/hidrive-cloud-speicher), this new backend will work for both.\r\n\r\n**The code is written by myself with support from my team here at [STRATO AG](https://www.strato.de/).**\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes, see #1069.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWe are mostly ready to start the review process for this change,\r\nbut there are some last quirks we would like to discuss with you before.\r\n\r\nI will also add a few notes to the code in its current state, highlighting some design choices that you may disagree with and thus need to change.\r\n\r\nBack to the discussion:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>This has been resolved.</summary>\r\n\r\n#### TestIntegration/FsMkdir/FsPutError\r\n\r\nWhen running `test_all -backends hidrive` there are currently two tests that are failing:\r\n- `TestIntegration/FsMkdir/FsPutError`\r\n- `TestCopyFileMaxTransfer`\r\n\r\nBoth fail for the same reason, that is highlighted by the comment above `TestFsPutError`:\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/e43b5ce5e59b5717a9819ff81805dd431f710c10/fstest/fstests/fstests.go#L698-L701\r\nThis is not a condition that the API can satisfy for files of arbitrary size.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: The question is how to proceed?\r\nIf it suffices that the tests pass for small files, that change can be made without too much hassle.\r\nIf the condition should hold true for files of any size, a system resembling the `Chunker`-backend would be a possible solution.\r\n\r\nSpecifically files up to 2 GiB can be uploaded using a single request; files larger than this need to be uploaded in multiple parts.\r\nThere is no transactional mechanism to upload a file in multiple parts.\r\n\r\nCurrently the `hidrive`-backend always creates an empty file as a first step, even if the file could be uploaded using a single request.\r\nThis is done to simplify the code and program flow, but can easily be changed, which would suffice for the tests to pass successfully. \r\nBut the condition `TestFsPutError` is supposed to test, will still not hold for files of any size, just for smaller ones.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n#### Symbolic Links\r\n\r\n_Note: The following section concerns symbolic links that can be natively stored with HiDrive, not the `.rclonelink`-files that rclone uses to encode and store symbolic links. The `hidrive`-backend will handle `.rclonelink`-files as regular files._\r\n\r\nHiDrive can natively store symbolic links (symlinks) and has a special type for them, but they can not be up- or downloaded directly using the API.\r\nIn general the operations the API can execute on symlinks directly are limited to:\r\n- delete\r\n- move (+ rename)\r\n- copy\r\n\r\nThis means that symlinks can not be handled by rclone as regular files.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the `hidrive`-backend simply ignores any native symlinks on `List(...)`, meaning that users can not interact with existing native symlinks in HiDrive-Accounts using rclone. \r\nAs a consequence, deleting using `rclone delete --rmdirs` will *not* be able to remove directories containing symlinks; they can only be deleted via `rclone purge`.\r\n\r\nAs noted, the `hidrive`-backend is not able to create native symlinks eitherway, but it still may be confusing for users if they can not interact with existing native symlinks.\r\n\r\nThe preferred solution would be for backends to be able to support native symlinks directly.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, a solution that comes to mind is to implement a special `fs.Object`-type in the `hidrive`-backend, that only supports the 3 API-operations mentioned above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5822/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5630551075,"node_id":"COE_lADOAQ-n5M4MIHLYzwAAAAFPm2Qj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5630551075","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-17T09:38:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6961717457,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M4MIHLYzwAAAAGe82DR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/6961717457","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-08T17:24:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6961717883,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M4MIHLYzwAAAAGe82J7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/6961717883","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b4d847cadd782b2ea4cc497a88b75ac6c2292e0b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/b4d847cadd782b2ea4cc497a88b75ac6c2292e0b","created_at":"2022-07-08T17:24:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
