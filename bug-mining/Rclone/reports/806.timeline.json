asking!\r\n\r\nWhat we should really do is make a provider for Scaleway (then we can list the endpoints etc) and have a little bit of code which resets max_upload_parts to 1000 for the Scaleway provider.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively easy adding a provider - do you fancy having a go at that @psychopatt  or someone else on this thread? It is a question of editing the data structures here, then putting a 3 line patch in to reset the MaxUploadParts...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/d55053098f98a5c6200ad2c75a05a142be96b3d8/backend/s3/s3.go#L75\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/642243445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3431362258,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQzMTM2MjI1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3431362258","actor":{"login":"psychopatt","id":66741203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzQxMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66741203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt","html_url":"https://github.com/psychopatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-10T20:35:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3431362261,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0MzEzNjIyNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3431362261","actor":{"login":"psychopatt","id":66741203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzQxMjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66741203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt","html_url":"https://github.com/psychopatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psychopatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-10T20:35:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/642254337","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4159#issuecomment-642254337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4159","id":642254337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjI1NDMzNw==","user":{"login":"ayufan","id":2419009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTkwMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2419009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan","html_url":"https://github.com/ayufan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ayufan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-10T20:57:44Z
