am unable to replicate this with the latest beta. Rclone is unable to be updated when a current rclone process is running (or hung!).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nI have the following set-up.\r\nremote:\r\n/LocalFolder\r\nUnionRemote: (remote: & /LocalFolder)\r\n\r\nBecause I am an idiot, I mounted the UnionRemote: on /LocalFolder and the process hung in Uninterruptible Sleep. If I close out my shell, re-open and attempt to ls -la on the directory with the mount, that will also hang. So typically to remedy a stuck mount, firing off fusermount -uz mount is more then sufficient but in this case, though it unmounts, it doesn't end the process and the processes are stuck in 'D', uninterruptible sleep. I've repeated this process three times, because hey what else can I do on a system I don't have root access too, and I can't trigger the mount to unhang. I hoped that by re-mounting and waiting, the kernel would be tricked into eventually firing off whatever system call it's looking for but it didn't work. I also am unable to perform an strace or a ptrace, or fire off any type of tracer round because I lack admin credentials. If I were to wager a guess however, I would entertain func checkMountpointOverlap, is the offending function, possibly because it doesn't check that Union is mounting on one of it's source mount points? I would do a pull but Go isn't my language and I'd be more worried about mucking things up, sorry.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/66e08e0cc8972000d84a61f262286f5644d9fdee/cmd/mountlib/mount.go\r\n\r\nrclone v1.51.0\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.7\r\n\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\nRclone Mount\r\n\r\nSo when you do this and it freezes up your mount, here is a great one-liner to show you all processes stuck in sleep state D.\r\nwatch -n 1 \"(ps aux | awk '\\$8 ~ /D/  { print \\$0 }')\"\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
