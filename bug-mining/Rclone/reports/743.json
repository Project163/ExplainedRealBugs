I believe the issue I am experiencing might be related to this https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/305 and should be resolved here https://github.com/pkg/sftp/pull/310. Hopefully updating the `sftp` dependency of `rclone` should resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n rclone version\r\nrclone v1.50.2\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone version\r\nrclone v1.50.2-073-ge2773b3b-beta\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nFedora release 31 (Thirty One)\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nAWS SFTP Transfer server\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nrclone copy local.txt aws-sftp-transfer-server:remote.txt\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019/12/01 18:56:11 ERROR : local.txt: Failed to copy: Update Create failed: sftp: \"Cannot open file in mode: CREATE|READ|TRUNCATE|WRITE\" (SSH_FX_OP_UNSUPPORTED)\r\n2019/12/01 18:56:11 ERROR : Attempt 1/3 failed with 3 errors and: Update Create failed: sftp: \"Cannot open file in mode: CREATE|READ|TRUNCATE|WRITE\" (SSH_FX_OP_UNSUPPORTED)\r\n2019/12/01 18:56:11 ERROR : local.txt: Failed to copy: Update Create failed: sftp: \"Cannot open file in mode: CREATE|READ|TRUNCATE|WRITE\" (SSH_FX_OP_UNSUPPORTED)\r\n2019/12/01 18:56:11 ERROR : Attempt 2/3 failed with 3 errors and: Update Create failed: sftp: \"Cannot open file in mode: CREATE|READ|TRUNCATE|WRITE\" (SSH_FX_OP_UNSUPPORTED)\r\n2019/12/01 18:56:11 ERROR : local.txt: Failed to copy: Update Create failed: sftp: \"Cannot open file in mode: CREATE|READ|TRUNCATE|WRITE\" (SSH_FX_OP_UNSUPPORTED)\r\n2019/12/01 18:56:11 ERROR : Attempt 3/3 failed with 3 errors and: Update Create failed: sftp: \"Cannot open file in mode: CREATE|READ|TRUNCATE|WRITE\" (SSH_FX_OP_UNSUPPORTED)\r\n2019/12/01 18:56:11 Failed to copy with 3 errors: last error was: Update Create failed: sftp: \"Cannot open file in mode: CREATE|READ|TRUNCATE|WRITE\" (SSH_FX_OP_UNSUPPORTED)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
