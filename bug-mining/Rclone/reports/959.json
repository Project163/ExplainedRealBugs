For that, I am trying to use the `service_account_credentials` Google Drive option. Note: for the examples below I have a file with the service account JSON blob, but for my actual use case `service_account_credentials` is way more convenient.\r\n\r\nWhen I execute\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone-beta config create google-drive drive service_account_credentials \"$(cat $HOME/Downloads/creds.json)\" shared_with_me true\r\n```\r\n\r\nrclone opens a browser and expects me to log in. This is unexpected. I would have expected it to quietly, and without requiring input, update the config file with the options. If I execute\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone-beta config create google-drive drive service_account_file $HOME/Downloads/creds.json shared_with_me true\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen it behaves as expected - no browser opened and it quietly updates the config file with the path to the file.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I can provide a dummy value for `service_account_file`, which seems to be ignored except for checking whether to open a browser window. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone-beta config create google-drive drive service_account_credentials \"$(cat $HOME/Downloads/creds.json)\" shared_with_me true service_account_file no\r\n```\r\n\r\nI dug into the code a little, and it looks like a check around [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/94e34cb783af60c89e7928e8d0ab96377f33a98b/backend/drive/drive.go#L202) for non-empty `opt.ServiceAccountCredentials` may help.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone-beta version\r\nrclone v1.55.0-beta.5247.94e34cb78\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.16\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nUbuntu Linux 20.04, 64-bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
