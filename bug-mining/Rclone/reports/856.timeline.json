What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nAn rclone user encountered an old corrupted file that resulted in an invalid modifcation timestamp\r\nreturned by mail.ru server as a large unsigned integer bitwise representing int64 \"-1\".\r\nCurrently mail.ru backend keeps server timestamps as signed int64 and the above number results\r\nin panic during json unmarshaling.\r\nThis issue is rare and cannot be easily reproduced in a test.\r\n\r\nThis fix makes mail.ru backend catch invalid timestamps and replace them by Unix epoch \"1970-01-01-...\".\r\nThe reporter confirmed that this change fixes issue for them\r\n(see https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4229#issuecomment-630050995).\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes, in the bug
