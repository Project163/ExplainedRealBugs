i don't have the logs anymore but i have since upgraded my pc to have significantly more RAM (from 16 to 48), so this has solved the problem anyway. I have also split my mounts up to have 2 read-only mounts and 5 upload mounts. I removed the buffer-size parameter from the upload mounts and changed the buffer-size paramater to a higher size on the read-only mounts. It is currentle 1024MB, but i don't know if this has sped anything up as i don't know how to test this. Responsiveness feels fast.\r\n\r\nWhile memory usage is still high, it is not a problem anymore. As i have so many mounts, it is difficult to see which one has a high memory usage. My largest one has a memory usage of 7 GB. I think that this is a mount that is currently uploading things. That does seem high, but i don't know enough to be able to say if that is too much as i have a lot of RAM left over.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/800383264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LeendertPlas","id":48712004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzEyMDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48712004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas","html_url":"https://github.com/LeendertPlas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeendertPlas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/800393997","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5019#issuecomment-800393997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5019","id":800393997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDM5Mzk5Nw==","user":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-16T16:05:53Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T16:05:53Z","body":"Thank you for reporting @LeendertPlas \r\n\r\nSo the original issue was solved by a patch which is now on master, the high memory usage - by a RAM upgrade.\r\n\r\nClosing as resolved :-)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/800393997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
