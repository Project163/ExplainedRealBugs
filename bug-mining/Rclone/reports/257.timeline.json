new to gocryptfs, but working on getting an encrypted cloud mount setup.\r\n\r\nI have rclone mount working great against ACD, but when trying to initialize a directory for gocryptfs I

WriteFileHandle.Release nothing to do\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've fiddled with a bunch of the options as well as tried to initialize a local directory and move the contents over to the ACD directory, but ultimately I always get fsync errors (or other errors depending on the scenario).\r\n\r\nthe options I was using to test rclone mount are:\r\n\r\nrclone mount -v --low-level-retries=50 --no-modtime\r\n\r\n(Although I use other optimizations for my main mount like readahead, etc).\r\n\r\nI tested writing files directly to the ACD mount I'm trying to initialize and use for gocryptfs and everything checks out ok for plain files.\r\n\r\nversions:\r\ngocryptfs v1.2; go-fuse 6c2b7d8; 2016-12-04 go1.7.4\r\nrclone v1.35\r\n\r\nHoping you can help, as the gocryptfs filesystem seems like the way to go based on all my research.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/71/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/71/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
