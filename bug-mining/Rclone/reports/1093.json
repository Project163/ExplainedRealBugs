We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/cant-use-sse-customer-key-with-non-printable-charactersin-config-file/32667\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\ntried with v1.56.2 and v1.50.2\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be any way to put a non-printable sse_customer_key in the config file -- also, that key should probably be obscured anyway.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThe easiest method that occurs to me is to just allow it to be obscured; since you can obscure a non-printable key and it results in printable characters that should do it. The other option I see would be to detect in some way if it is a base64 encoded value, e.g. \"this is longer than 32 bytes and it's an AES256 key, so it must be b64 encoded\" or supporting `base64:<b64 encoded customer key>`\r\n\r\nSeems like it should be a simple enough change.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
