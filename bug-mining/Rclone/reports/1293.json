I was hoping to easily substitute rclone by rsync in my script.. but it isn't working out because rsync doesn't support filter-from and their include/exclude/include-from/exclude-from works differently from rclone's. Rclone is much more intuitive and I'm finding it impossible to use the same filters =/\r\n\r\nHowever rsync has a --files-from which says \"rsync all those files in a file and nothing else\" This would work perfectly if I could get Rclone to produce a list of files that match Rclone's filters.. is there a way to do that? I realize Rclone's dry-run comes close but then a bunch of text would need to be grepped out so rsync would accept it as a list of filepaths\r\n\r\nany help would be.. really appreciated!","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
