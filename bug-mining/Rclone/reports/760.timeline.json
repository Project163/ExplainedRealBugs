`--multi-thread-streams 0` seems to remove the problem (transferred 60GB successfully)\r\n\r\nGood, at least we have a work-around :-)\r\n\r\n> After a successful copy, I tried again without `--multi-thread-streams 0` and it worked _as long as there were no files to download_ (i.e. no differences). I got the \"hanging\" again over the 3 connections if forced a redownload of some files by deleting them on the destination.\r\n\r\nSo it sounds like a definite problem with the multi thread download and the FTP backend.\r\n\r\nThanks for your instructions on how to replicate - I manged to replicate them locally here too.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be dependent on the size of the file transferred.\r\n\r\nI do a multithread copy from pureftp in the integration tests, but it never fails... The file transferred is only 128k though.  If I bump that up to 10M then I can see it failing\r\n\r\nI see this with wireshark.  Note these two packets are\r\n- sequential\r\n- on the same tcp connection\r\n\r\nNote the `150-` message then the `150 ` message which indicates end of message.  This is followed by another `150 ` message in the next frame which isn't allowed.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is a bug in pureftpd, specifically due to its handling of REST (which is what multi thread downloads use).\r\n\r\nIt turns out there is an issue open for this already: https://github.com/jedisct1/pure-ftpd/issues/138\r\n\r\nIn the capture for the successful test the `measured here` messages
