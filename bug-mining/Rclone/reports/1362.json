Given `sync`/`copy` command with specific source filename `1.68.2` used to sync only the single specified file. In `1.69.0` however, it copies entire file's directory instead (or nothing if HTTP server doesn't allow file listing).\n\nUsing `git bisect` I have identified the breaking change to introduced by https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/9b4b3033da25ec41aabb35b858a765dd734a5f09 (PR: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7668).\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\n```\nrclone v1.69.0\n- os/version: arch 25.0.0 (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 5.10.230-1-MANJARO (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.23.4\n- go/linking: dynamic\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\nAlso tested with `1.69.0` and `master` (`2a1e28f5f5683eaba22d67a0e253c95b934f8c41`)\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nLinux Manjaro, 64 bit\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
