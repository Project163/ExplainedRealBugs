I just drop the latest rclone into my \"files\" dir and deploy. However, sometimes I just want/need to do a quick scripted installation of rclone on a single, one-off host without using Ansible. I have a little script similar to the \"linux binary\" description here: http://rclone.org/install/. However, it requires that I specify the version I want, like: http://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-v1.18-linux-amd64.zip.\n\nIt would be awfully convenient to be able to instead reference something like:\n\nhttp://downloads.rclone.org/linux-amd64/latest\n\n... which could just be a symlink to the latest version.\n\nThoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
