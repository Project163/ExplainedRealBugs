I have almost all arches activated but in the latest release a file named [rclone-v1.53.0-linux-arm-v7.deb](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/releases/download/v1.53.0/rclone-v1.53.0-linux-arm-v7.deb) with the architecture of ``arm-v7`` got introduced. When I try to import the file I get the following error:\r\n```\r\nError looking at 'timestamp/rclone-v1.53.0-linux-arm-v7.deb': 'arm-v7' is not one of the valid architectures: 'amd64 arm64 armhf i386 mips mipsel ppc64el s390x'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error is easy for me to fix the in mirror script but it does not solve the underlying issue that debian has no arch which is named ``arm-v7``. Debian only has the following arm related arches: ``arm64``, ``armel`` and ``armhf``.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the rpm has the same problem but I assume it.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n1.53.0\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nDebian\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
