is not deleting files that are not owned by the account owner.  This gets in the way of keeping shared folders in sync.\n\nThrough the web-based UI you can still delete non-owned files, and you can also do it through Google Apps Scripts, so I'm pretty sure there is an API call you can make that will allow it.  Try removeFile - that worked in an Apps Script I tried (and some other API calls to send the file to trash did _not_ work).\n\nThank you\n\nOK, more info:\n1) When you purge a non-empty directory, even if that directory contains non-owned files, it works. But the problem is the only way to do it now is to remove the whole directory, and if it's a share directory, then you have to create a new directory and reshare it which isn't a good workflow.\n\n2) When you run: rclone purge remote:SharedFolder/nonOwnedFile.txt it gives the errors:\n-Error 403, insufficient permissions.  This is incorrect, as the owner of the folder does have permission to delete a shared file.\n-Failed to purge: can't rmdir in limited fs\n\n3) When you run rclone purge remote:SharedFolder/OwnedFile.txt it actually does delete the file but it gives the error \"Failed to purge: can't rmdir in limited
