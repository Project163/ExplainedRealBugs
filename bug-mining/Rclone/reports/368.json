The mount worked, however, despite the directory not being empty.  This caused Finder to panic and reset all of my preferences for the application dock, Finder file browser, icons, wallpaper, etc.  It was like I just turned on a new computer or created a new user account.  I received an error message from MySQL Workbench stating that it could not write to a file in my home directory.  I then unmounted the rclone drive, restarted the computer, but it was still in the corrupted state.  I had to restore my user directory from a Time Machine backup to get everything back to a good state.  Existing files were still present such as Documents and Downloads, but a condition was created where normal access to my home directory was no longer available and other applications that depend on it panicked and reset to defaults.\r\n\r\nThis item has already been discussed on the forum at: https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-mount-clobbered-my-home-directory-after-a-typing-mistake/2032\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
