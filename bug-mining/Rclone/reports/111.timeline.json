It is possible to set ACLs on swift accounts which grant access to other users.  http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_auth.html has more information.  It is also entirely possible to have a Swift account (which is really just a storage area) that is not associated with any particular user, but accessible by a service user or \"super-user\".\n\nThe use case I'm actually thinking of that this feature would help massively is migration from one Swift cluster to another.  Instead of having to configure rclone with user credentials for every individual user, we could just use the credentials from one super-user and create entries for every account we want to migrate.  We'd still have to configure .rclone.conf entry for each account, but this would save us from having to know the username and password for individual users.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/146330417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"treyd","id":2250205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTAyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2250205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd","html_url":"https://github.com/treyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/146334620","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/167#issuecomment-146334620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/167","id":146334620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjMzNDYyMA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-07T21:25:10Z","updated_at":"2015-10-07T21:25:10Z","body":"I see what you are getting at.

With Swift you can set a read/write ACL for user `uB` on `cA`.\n\nAs `uB` isn't a member of tenant `A` then authentication gonna throw a storage URL referencing the account related to tenant `B` while `uB` actually needs to reference `A`'s account to access `cA`.\n\nSo for the moment rclone will try to use storage URL `https://storage.foo.net/v2/AUTH_<B_id>` so that's necessary to override it with `https://storage.foo.net/v2/AUTH_<A_id>`\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/169625130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xlucas","id":2470398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzAzOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2470398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas","html_url":"https://github.com/xlucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xlucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":508102404,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwODEwMjQwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/508102404","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-07T10:42:48Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":508102482,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDUwODEwMjQ4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/508102482","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-07T10:42:54Z","milestone":{"title":"Soon"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/169626270","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/167#issuecomment-169626270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/167","id":169626270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTYyNjI3MA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-07T10:44:25Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T10:44:25Z","body":"OK
