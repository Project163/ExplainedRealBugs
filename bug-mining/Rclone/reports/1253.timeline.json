errors.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2002541634/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"drvdijk","id":3451818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTE4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3451818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk","html_url":"https://github.com/drvdijk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drvdijk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12143479939,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M6CBz75zwAAAALTzsyD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/12143479939","actor":{"login":"kapitainsky","id":15635386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM1Mzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15635386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky","html_url":"https://github.com/kapitainsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-17T17:07:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12143479943,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M6CBz75zwAAAALTzsyH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/12143479943","actor":{"login":"kapitainsky","id":15635386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM1Mzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15635386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky","html_url":"https://github.com/kapitainsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapitainsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-17T17:07:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12218897872,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M6CBz75zwAAAALYTZXQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/12218897872","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ff855fe1fbdea4ea36d50adff38ec00e9ecd76dd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/ff855fe1fbdea4ea36d50adff38ec00e9ecd76dd","created_at":"2024-03-22T17:36:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://a
