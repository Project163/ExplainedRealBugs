rclone  v1.38-181 include removal of empty folders once rclone move is finished, however that is causing problems if other apps expect those paths.\r\n\r\nI use the following setup:\r\nSonarr is

this case /storage/local \r\n\r\nWith previous version, I used script that would remove empty folders under ./local/movies & series.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if new flag was added that would skip
