What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n1.46\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nIt seems that ZFS only supports a specific combination of the fallocate flags, and rclone isn't meeting that criteria.\r\nhttps://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/blob/09ec770c2cfdb105e1d4a6e7470f2456d37c65e0/module/zfs/zpl_file.c#L662\r\nDue to this, when a file is written it spits out a message in debug:\r\n```\r\n2019/03/22 18:16:19 DEBUG : MangoJuice/12-13-22 Mango Dango.avi: Failed to pre-allocate: operation not supported\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nMake an option to disable pre-allocation or if it's possible to adjust the pre-allocation method for ZFS and/or other filesystems that may have the same issue.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3066/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
