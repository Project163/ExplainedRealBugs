(eg Google Drive)\r\nnone / local copy in a very simple repro\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrclone -vv -P sync d:\\temp c:\\temp \r\n\r\nThe relevant problem is the -P switch, if I omit -P it works fine. If I run the same command in a regular batch file, it's fine, too.\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n```\r\nrclone -vv -P sync d:\\temp c:\\temp \r\n2018/12/17 21:33:13 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.45\" starting with parameters [\"c:\\\\Apps\\\\rclone\\\\rclone\" \"-vv\" \"-P\" \"sync\" \"d:\\\\temp\" \"c:\\\\temp\"]\r\n2018/12/17 21:33:13 DEBUG : Using config file from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\tvserverWin7\\\\.config\\\\rclone\\\\rclone.conf\"\r\npanic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\r\n[signal 0xc0000005 code=0x0 addr=0xa0 pc=0xe2c855]\r\n\r\ngoroutine 33 [running]:\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm.(*AnsiParser).execute(0xc000446340, 0x1d, 0x20)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/parser_actions.go:118 +0x35\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm.groundState.Handle(0x128c216, 0x6, 0xc000446340, 0xa, 0xc0004601a0, 0x192, 0x192, 0xc000089958)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/ground_state.go:20 +0x17e\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm.(*AnsiParser).handle(0xc000446340, 0x10a, 0x1a0, 0x18f)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/parser.go:109 +0x4d\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm.(*AnsiParser).Parse(0xc000446340, 0xc000460340, 0x18f, 0x1a0, 0x18f, 0x1a0, 0x0)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/vendor/github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/parser.go:99 +0x5f\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/cmd.writeToTerminal(0xc00045e000, 0x18f, 0x1b8)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/cmd/progress_windows.go:33 +0x14b\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/cmd.printProgress(0xc00002a320, 0x4b)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/cmd/progress.go:124 +0x38d\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/cmd.startProgress.func1(0x128bf06, 0xc00002c8d0, 0x2f)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/cmd/progress.go:35 +0x167\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/fs.LogPrintf(0x106, 0x121d160, 0xc0002ff4a0, 0x1293195, 0xc, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/fs/log.go:82 +0xa2\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/fs.Infof(0x121d160, 0xc0002ff4a0, 0x1293195, 0xc, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/fs/log.go:116 +0x8c\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/fs/operations.Copy(0x1431040, 0xc0000a1480, 0x0, 0xc000054f60, 0xc000354a20, 0x21, 0x14310c0, 0xc0002ff4a0, 0x0, 0x0, ...)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/fs/operations/operations.go:356 +0x59d\r\ngithub.com/ncw/rclone/fs/sync.(*syncCopyMove).pairCopyOrMove(0xc000264700, 0xc000322a40, 0x1431040, 0xc0000a1480, 0xc0002647d8)\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/fs/sync/sync.go:280 +0x243\r\ncreated by github.com/ncw/rclone/fs/sync.(*syncCopyMove).startTransfers\r\n\tC:/gopath/src/github.com/ncw/rclone/fs/sync/sync.go:306 +0xa6\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Jenkins\\workspace\\test_rclone_crash>exit 2 \r\nBuild step 'Execute Windows batch command' marked build as failure\r\nFinished: FAILURE\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"Lyve1981","id":1901600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDE2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981","html_url":"https://github.com/Lyve1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyve1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
