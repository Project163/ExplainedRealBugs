I am having trouble reproducing it, though. For me, the following paths:\r\n```\r\nremote:/path/with/unneeded/slash\r\nremote:path/with/unneeded/slash\r\n```\r\nboth result in:\r\n```\r\nremote_path_with_unneeded_slash\r\n```\r\nin the listing filename. \r\n\r\nAre you using any backend-specific flags that could be overriding your config and adding a suffixed canonical name? ([More info](https://rclone.org/bisync/#overridden-configs))\r\n\r\nAnother thing that would be helpful is if you could try going into your workdir to see what bisync is actually naming the listing files, and whether there is any difference when you `--resync` with and without the slash. \r\n\r\nFor example, try something like the following sequence:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone bisync remote:/path/with/unneeded/slash /some/local/path --resync\r\nrclone lsl '~/.cache/rclone/bisync'\r\nrclone bisync remote:path/with/unneeded/slash /some/local/path --resync\r\nrclone lsl '~/.cache/rclone/bisync'\r\n```\r\nAnd let me know if there is any difference between the filenames output by the two `lsl`s?\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't yield clues, I'm also curious if it could be something specific to the encoding settings on Proton Drive. Any chance you could try the same thing with Google Drive and see if you get a different result?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1813354077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10972921028,"node_id":"AE_lADOAQ-n5M528eLMzwAAAAKOCXzE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10972921028","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-15T22:21:10Z","assignee":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10972921950,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M528eLMzwAAAAKOCYBe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10972921950","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-15T22:21:19Z","label":{"name":"bisync","color":"1D76DB"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1815198855","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7423#issuecomment-1815198855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7423","id":1815198855,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5sMbyH","user":{"login":"LivingUserError","id":87676474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Njc2NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87676

I [added a section to the docs](https://rclone.org/bisync/#overridden-configs) about it in `v1.64.0`, but I don't think that goes far enough, as users are continuing to stumble over it, and it can actually have serious consequences in the reverse direction (if you _remove_ a backend-specific flag and still have old listings using the alternate name.) \r\n\r\nThe ultimate fix for this is #5678, but in the meantime I think we should normalize to the non-canonical name for listings -- it should not be possible to have more than one session name for the same pair of bisync paths.

An unintended consequence of this was that if a user added a backend-specific flag from the command line (thus \"overriding\" the config), bisync would fail to find the listing files it created during the prior run without this flag, due to the path now having a {hexstring} suffix that wasn't there before (or vice versa, if the flag was present when the session was established, and later removed.) This would sometimes cause bisync to fail with a critical error (if no listing existed with the alternate name), or worse -- it would sometimes cause bisync to use an old, incorrect listing (if old listings with the alternate name DID still exist, from before the user changed their flags.) \r\n\r\nAfter this change, the issue is fixed by always normalizing the SessionName to the non-canonical version (no {hexstring} suffix), regardless of the flags. To avoid a breaking change, we first check if a suffixed listing exists. If so, we rename it (and overwrite the non-suffixed version, if any.) If not, we carry on with the non-suffixed version. (We should only find a suffixed version if created prior to this commit.) \r\n\r\nThe result for the user is that the same pair of paths will always use the same .lst filenames, with or without backend-specific flags.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n- #7423\r\n- [Forum post](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=7.%20Overridden%20config%20can%20cause%20bisync%20critical%20error%20requiring%20%2D%2Dresync)\r\n- [User Report](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-missed-syncing-changed-file-no-error-no-warning/41174/6?u=nielash)\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nielash/rclone/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nielash/rclone/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-09T18:26:33Z","updated_at":"2023-12-09T18:26:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7497","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7497/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7497/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7497/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7497","id":2033974772,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAQ-n5M5hl-MQ","number":7497,"title":"bisync: normalize session name to non-canonical (and docs edits) -

An unintended consequence of this was that if a user added a backend-specific flag from the command line (thus \"overriding\" the config), bisync would fail to find the listing files it created during the prior run without this flag, due to the path now having a {hexstring} suffix that wasn't there before (or vice versa, if the flag was present when the session was established, and later removed.) This would sometimes cause bisync to fail with a critical error (if no listing existed with the alternate name), or worse -- it would sometimes cause bisync to use an old, incorrect listing (if old listings with the alternate name DID still exist, from before the user changed their flags.) \r\n\r\nAfter this change, the issue is fixed by always normalizing the SessionName to the non-canonical version (no {hexstring} suffix), regardless of the flags. To avoid a breaking change, we first check if a suffixed listing exists. If so, we rename it (and overwrite the non-suffixed version, if any.) If not, we carry on with the non-suffixed version.
