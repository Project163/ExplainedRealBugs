The root path is the root \"collection\"\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#page-16\r\n\r\n> There is a standing convention that when a collection is referred to\r\n   by its name without a trailing slash, the server MAY handle the\r\n   request as if the trailing slash were present.  In this case, it\r\n   SHOULD return a Content-Location header in the response, pointing to\r\n   the URL ending with the \"/\".  For example, if a client invokes a\r\n   method on http://example.com/blah (no trailing slash), the server may\r\n   respond as if the operation were invoked on http://example.com/blah/\r\n   (trailing slash), and should return a Content-Location header with\r\n   the value http://example.com/blah/.  Wherever a server produces a URL\r\n   referring to a collection, the server SHOULD include the trailing\r\n   slash.  In general, clients SHOULD use the trailing slash form of\r\n   collection names.  If clients do not use the trailing slash form the\r\n   client needs to be prepared to see a redirect response.\r\n\r\nWhich means I think that rclone is a standards compliant server - the RFC only says that \"when a collection is referred to its name without a trailing slash, the server MAY handle the request as if the trailing slash were present\".\r\n\r\nSo I'd say the bug is in the client here for ignoring the trailing slash in the URL!\r\n\r\nThere are two possible fixes for this\r\n\r\n1. Redirecting \"http://host/path/to/whatever\" to \"http://host/path/to/whatever/\" if `whatever` doesn't exist as a file.\r\n2. Redirecting only the root it it was specified without a `/`. This might not work for subdirectories though.\r\n\r\nSo can you try without --baseurl and see if the client can browse into subdirectories (and subsubdirs) OK? That will tell us if the simple fix (2) will work.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/735374603/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/735394323","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4814#issuecomment-735394323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4814","id":735394323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTM5NDMyMw==","user":{"login":"montvid","id":23270059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjcwMDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23270059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid","html_url":"https://github.com/montvid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/montvid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-29T13:28:32Z","updated_at":"2020-11-29T13:28:32Z","body":"Yes the client can browse into subdirectories (and subsubdirs) OK.
