I had the same thought myself but didn't manage to squeeze it into the 1.43 release.\r\n\r\nI was thinking to remove all the backend flags which would remove 257 of the flags (but show them with --help backend or some other flag), but that still leaves 92.  This would make the default output look like rsync which has 132 flags by default.\r\n\r\nDo you think that would be enough of a fix?\r\n\r\nI like your idea of chopping all the global flags off for `rclone command --help`. What about for `rclone help`?  or just `rclone`?\r\n\r\nAnother thing I could do is curate the Global flags, so by default not show the backend flags or the less important flags.  I get a list of about 60 if I do that.\r\n\r\nAnother idea would be to split the flags up so only the flags which apply to any given command are shown.  This would be quite tricky and wouldn't cut the list down at all in some important cases (eg `sync` or `copy` or `move`)\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to see most is if anyone has any prior art on this.

anyone reading this experiencing the same issue:\r\nA quick workaround right now is to run `rclone <cmd> --help | sed '/Global Flags:/,$d'`\r\n____________________\r\n\r\nI've only started using rclone about a week ago, so I'm not sure what would be the most syntax-consistent way of doing this, but this would be my suggestion:\r\n\r\n- As already mentioned, `rclone <cmd> --help` and `rclone help <cmd>` can drop all the global flags.\r\n- `rclone`, `rclone --help`, and `rclone help` will show the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\nRclone is a command line program to sync files and directories to and\r\nfrom various cloud storage systems and using file transfer services.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n  * MD5/SHA1 hashes checked at all times for file integrity\r\n  * Timestamps preserved on files\r\n  * Partial syncs supported on a whole file basis\r\n  * Copy mode to just copy new/changed files\r\n  * Sync (one way) mode to make a directory identical\r\n  * Check mode to check for file hash equality\r\n  * Can sync to and from network, eg two different cloud accounts\r\n\r\nSee the home page for installation, usage, documentation, changelog\r\nand configuration walkthroughs.\r\n\r\n  *

like it!\r\n\r\nTwo small things I've noticed:\r\n\r\n1. `./rclone --help | less -N` spits out this string on line 32:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelp            Sync files and directories to and from local and remote object stores - v1.43-129-ge4538afe-help-beta\r\n```\r\nWhich I'm guessing is just a simple typo or copy/paste error somewhere in the code.\r\n\r\n2. When viewing help information for a subcommand, e.g `rclone copy --help`, the bottom text will say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUse \"rclone copy [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\n```\r\ninstead of \r\n```\r\nUse \"rclone [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but it might be confusing for other users. This may make sense for subcommands which have their own sub-subcommands, but it seems misleading for simpler commands like `copy`","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/426875720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgsunder","id":16943235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQzMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16943235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder","html_url":"https://github.com/sgsunder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgsunder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1884251091,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4ODQyNTEwOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1884251091","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"97467444533256bf660ed94846b90c3ab7cbeee6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/97467444533256bf660ed94846b90c3ab7cbeee6","created_at":"2018-10-04T10:40:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1884251095,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4ODQyNTEwOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1884251095","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"35ed5524b8510dbc69bee7fac93e41bc7573e263","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/35ed5524b8510dbc69bee7fac93e41bc7573e263","created_at":"2018-10-04T10:40:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1884251100,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4ODQyNTExMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1884251100","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2f4543d149b77f9662177094f8a391cc77c97829","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/2f4543d149b77f9662177094f8a391cc77c97829","created_at":"2
