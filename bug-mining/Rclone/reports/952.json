noticed just now that if you attempt to use `rclone authorize` with zoho then it fails because `region` is not set and it ends up trying to look up `auth.zoho.` (no extension).\r\n\r\nThe check for region being set needs to include `region == \"\"` here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/20c5ca08fbf4222178f01ccd47dca8d04c237be8/backend/zoho/zoho.go#L163-L166\r\n\r\nAnyway, that won't fix the problem, it will just make it blow up neatly with an error message.\r\n\r\nI think what we need to be doing is passing the whole `m` into `rclone authorize` (minus the token) otherwise `rclone authorize` won't know what the `region` is.\r\n\r\nZoho isn't the only backend with this problem, pcloud and sharefile have it too off the top of my head. Sharefile sets things in the config file on rclone oauth so ideally the return from `rclone authorize` should be an update to `m` including the token.\r\n\r\n@buengese - thoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
