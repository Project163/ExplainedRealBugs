Here's a link to a document detailing why I removed Glacier support from HashBackup: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.hashbackup.com/technical/glacier-eol \r\n\r\nSome of this has changed recently as Amazon has made it possible to access Glacier without the 4-hour delay, but many of the other points are still valid.

IA is very easy to add: it's just a storage class header on the\nupload and other S3 operations aren't affected.  RRS (Reduced\nRedundancy Storage) is also a storage class option, but I'd avoid it\nbecause according to Amazon, it statistically loses 1 file in 10K per\nyear, and from the way they have it listed on their website, I believe\nthey will eventually deprecate it, like Google is doing with DRA\n(Durable Reduced Availability).\n\nOther gotchas: S3 IA rounds up every file size to 128K, so using the\ncost difference between IA and regular S3, you don't want to use IA\nfor any files below 53400 bytes because it will be more expensive than\nregular S3.  There is also a 30-day minimum storage period with IA: if\nyou delete an object before it has been stored 30 days, you're still\ncharged for 30 days.  There's not a good way to optimize for this\nbecause most of the time the software layer between the storage\nservice and user data doesn't know how long a file will be stored.\n\nGoogle also has a 30-day delete penalty with Nearline, and with\nColdline, it's 90 days.  In my opinion, these complex pricing\nstrategies are gimmicks that trick people into paying more in storage\ncosts.  For example, Coldline is 3.7x cheaper per month vs regular\nstorage costs, but it could cost 90x more to store a short-lived\nobject if you're not careful.\n\nGoogle Class A operation costs are also double with Nearline and\nColdline, but at least there is no file size minimum as with S3 IA.\nClass B operations are more than double with Nearline, and 12x more\nwith Coldline.  With HashBackup, this isn't a big deal because it is\nvery stingy with operations, but for something like rclone where you\nare doing a lot of directory listings and transferring a lot of\nindividual files, it could matter.\n\nOn 1/27/17, Nick Craig-Wood <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> @hashbackup thanks for the writeup - very interesting.\n>\n> So it looks like S3 Infrequent Access would be the way to go.
