Wait...mandb: warning: /usr/local/man/man1/rclone.1: whatis parse for rclone(1) failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn context:\r\n\r\n```\r\n…\r\nProcessing manual pages under /usr/share/man/sv...\r\nChecking for stray cats under /usr/share/man/sv...\r\nChecking for stray cats under /var/cache/man/sv...\r\nPurging old database entries in /usr/share/man/it...\r\nProcessing manual pages under /usr/share/man/it...\r\nChecking for stray cats under /usr/share/man/it...\r\nChecking for stray cats under /var/cache/man/it...\r\nProcessing manual pages under /usr/local/man...\r\nUpdating index cache for path `/usr/local/man/man1'.

Check https://rclone.org/docs/ for more details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is on a clean install of Raspbian (details below) so it's not as if `rclone` was already installed, migrated, self-updated etc.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed the same thing installing a Bookworm guest on Proxmox VE, also a clean install from Debian distribution media. I haven't tried Bullseye on either platform to see whether this is something peculiar to Bookworm.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone version\r\nrclone v1.64.2\r\n- os/version: raspbian 12.2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.1.0-rpi6-rpi-v8 (aarch64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: arm64 (ARMv8 compatible)\r\n- go/version: go1.21.3\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n$ uname -a\r\nLinux tri-dev 6.1.0-rpi6-rpi-v8 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 1:6.1.58-1+rpt2 (2023-10-27) aarch64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi OS (Bookworm) 64-bit. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* `2023-10-10-raspios-bookworm-arm64-lite.img.xz` (from [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/))\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nNot relevant - this is an install-time problem.\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nNot relevant - this is not a problem running `rclone`. It is an install-time problem. The error output is shown above.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
