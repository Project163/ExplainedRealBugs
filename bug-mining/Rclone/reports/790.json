This new `io.Reader` is updated in the `Transfer` object's `Account` at [operations.go #425](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/fs/operations/operations.go#L425) through the `UpdateReader` call.\r\n\r\n`UpdateReader` replaces the `io.Reader`, but does not reset the `Account.bytes`. Next time when a read is done during retry, the percentage goes above 100%.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, can mess up the total stats as well.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-28 17-33-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7876747/80490780-7ed59580-897f-11ea-9be4-f8fe955178c0.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
