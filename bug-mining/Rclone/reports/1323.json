The destination file size remains 0 throughout, and retries did not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nI encountered the same error on both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 22.04. Below, I’ve included the output with the -vv option enabled. Additionally, I’ve shared the problematic file link. You can use PikPak to download the shared file and directly reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, similar errors occur when downloading other files, but retrying usually resolves the issue. However, these two files cannot be downloaded no matter what.\r\n\r\n[Here are the shared link](https://mypikpak.com/s/VOE6mm0jtJsX7XnzqGK9f8lLo1)\r\n\r\nIf you need any additional information, please feel free to let me know.
