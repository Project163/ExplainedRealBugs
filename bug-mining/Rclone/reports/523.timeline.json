If you are upgrading from older versions of rclone, please run `rclone config` and re-configure this backend.\r\n\r\nafter running rclone config I got:\r\n\r\n2018/10/03 22:48:26 Failed to query available drives: HTTP error 401 (401 Unauthorized) returned body: \"{\\r\\n  \\\"error\\\": {\\r\\n    \\\"code\\\": \\\"InvalidAuthenticationToken\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"message\\\": \\\"CompactToken parsing failed with error code: 8004920A\\\",\\r\\n    \\\"innerError\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"request-id\\\": \\\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"date\\\": \\\"2018-10-03T20:48:26\\\"\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\"\r\n\r\nSo I installed the latest stable version and it worked again, and still got the onenote error (which is to be expected). I did the authorization however with the stable rclone version on a windows desktop and used the beta version on debian. Maybe this is the cause of the above errors or is there a bug?
