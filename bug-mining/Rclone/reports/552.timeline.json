I tried all available flags that can potentially speed this up but they don't work (including `--size-only`, `--checksum`). Besides `lsf` is slow as well and it doesn't have these.\r\n\r\nI was wrong about needing an extra transaction to read the modification time - it is supplied in the directory listings so that explains your result.\r\n\r\n> Why would you need 100 transactions to read 100 files? My ruby code reads 5000 files in one transaction. For `lsf` I don't need anything except filenames and for copying I enable all flags that disable needing any metadata to be present, so rclone can use \"List Blobs\" instead of checking each file individually.\r\n\r\nrclone will be reading directories in chunks of 5000 too.  It will buffer them in memory until it has read the whole directory before acting on it though.\r\n\r\nSo the answer is it shouldn't do...\r\n\r\nHere is a beta for you to try.  I changed over to using the s3 pacer so it now doesn't sleep at all betwen requests.  I also enabled `-vv --dump requests` - you can use this to see how many HTTP requests rclone is really making.\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.rclone.org/branch/v1.45-011-gba8aa73a-fix-2654-azureblob-client-beta/ (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nNote that if you want to speed up lsf, you can use `--checkers` with it too.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/443191229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/443209631","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2799#issuecomment-443209631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2799","id":443209631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzIwOTYzMQ==","user":{"login":"sheerun","id":292365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun","html_url":"https://github.com/sheerun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheerun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-30T13:52:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T13:53:15Z","body":"Thank you I'll try this after I'll deal with the upload of 30M of files I've downloaded from Azure (it took 4 days) to DigitalOcean.
