Happens on debian bookworm and gentoo alike.\n\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\n\nIrrelevant. Test with `:memory:`\n\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\nIrrelevant. Even `rclone version` fails to start when run as systemd service.\n\n```\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/home/marcel/arbeitskopien/rclone/rclone --log-level=DEBUG version\n```\n\n\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\nLiterally:\n```\n```\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
