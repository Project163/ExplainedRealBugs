Cloud:cloud/path --include *something*\r\n\r\nAs described in the title the upload speeds per file vary a lot, while I get a pretty constant overall upload speed displayed, for example `Transferred:   1.305 GBytes (584.462 kBytes/s)`\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of the problem:\r\n![bildschirmfoto vom 2016-12-24

speed. Also the ETA is alternating alot and probably also not very accurate.\r\n\r\nMaybe the smothing algorithm could be improved.","closed_by":{"login":"breunigs","id":307954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzk1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/307954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs","html_url":"https://github.com/breunigs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breunigs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
