I think your analysis is correct that `readMetaDataForPath` shouldn't assume `dc.findRoot == true` even if `dc.Get(\"\")` returns an ID. But I think instead of calling `dc.FindRoot(false)` in `readMetaDataForPath`, it may be better to call `dc.RootParentID()` and see if it returns an error. That way we don't need to have network traffic.\r\n\r\n`dc.RootParentID()` returns an error immediately if any of the following is true:\r\n- `!dc.findRoot`\r\n- `dc.rootParentID == \"\"` (which is impossible because the code after [onedrive.go#379](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/b9e16b36e5208dc7460af59d9e75dc8234caca27/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L379) only runs if root is inside a folder so it must have a parent)\r\n- `dc.rootID == dc.trueRootID` (which is also impossible because root is inside a folder)\r\n\r\nAnd if `dc.RootParentID()` returns an error, we know `dc.findRoot == false` and will proceed with the \"query manually\" branch.\r\n\r\nFinally, there should also be a unit test for this.\r\n\r\n@ncw @B4dM4n Would like to hear your

Then before the `FsMkdir` test finishes, we do\r\n\r\n```go\r\ndeepRemote, err := fs.NewFs(remote.Name() + \":\" + remote.Root() + \"/deeper/nonexisting/directory\")\r\nrequire.NoError(t, err)\r\n\r\nfirstSlashIndex := strings.IndexRune(deepRemote.Root(), '/')\r\nfirstDir := deepRemote.Root()[:firstSlashIndex]\r\n_, err = deepRemote.NewObject(firstDir)\r\nrequire.Equal(t, fs.ErrorObjectNotFound, err)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first two lines create a remote whose `dirCache.foundRoot == false`. The last four lines try getting the object at the absolute path `user/given/path/rclone-test-1234567890/deeper/nonexisting/directory/user`, which doesn't exist. And if the backend code is assuming `dirCache.Get(\"\")` to be the ID of `user/given/path/rclone-test-1234567890/deeper/nonexisting/directory` (while it's actually the ID of the absolute root), `deepRemote.NewObject` will not return `fs.ErrorObjectNotFound` and the test will fail.\r\n\r\nI tested with OneDrive before and after the fix and it worked. Now one thing I'm concerned about is whether there is any backend that returns `fs.ErrorObjectNotFound` in `NewObject` because it thinks \"there _is_ a directory, not an object, so the _object_ is not found\".","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/495164682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cnly","id":3103188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly","html_url":"https://github.com/Cnly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2362415308,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNjI0MTUzMDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2362415308","actor":{"login":"Cnly","id":3103188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly","html_url":"https://github.com/Cnly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8c663d3de3894f14113bac3b0cc327dc801f37c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/8c663d3de3894f14113bac3b0cc327dc801f37c4","created_at":"2019-05-23T13:11:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/495914790","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3164#issuecomment-495914790","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3164","id":495914790,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTkxNDc5MA==","user":{"login":"Cnly","id":3103188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly","html_url":"https://github.com/Cnly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-25T12:30:05Z","updated_at":"2019-05-25T12:30:05Z","body":"@ncw
