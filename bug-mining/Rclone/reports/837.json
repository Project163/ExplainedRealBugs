We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.51.0\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.14rc1\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nHi, \r\nIBM Cloud is changing endpoints for Object Storage service, see announcement below. It would be nice to update current endpoints with new one, see announcement:\r\n\r\nDear Cloud Object Storage Client,\r\n\r\nThis is a kindly reminder to transition to our IBM Cloud endpoints, which were introduced on December 17, 2017, to provide a better experience for our IBM Cloud. If you have not already transitioned from our legacy endpoints, please plan to do so before the end of October 2020. We are here to help and guide you with following information.\r\n\r\nAs the final stage of the IBM Cloud endpoint transition, IBM Cloud Object Storage endpoints ending in *.objectstorage.softlayer.net, *.objectstorage.service.networklayer.com, and *.objectstorage.adn.networklayer.com will be shutdown. The end of support is scheduled for November 1, 2020.\r\n\r\nWhat's changing?\r\nAfter November 1, 2020 all legacy endpoints that end in in *.objectstorage.softlayer.net, *.objectstorage.service.networklayer.com, and *.objectstorage.adn.networklayer.com will no longer be accessible.\r\n\r\nWhat do I need to do?\r\nApplications that use a legacy endpoint need to be updated to use the corresponding current endpoint. The current Cloud Object Storage offering endpoints can be found here: https://control.cloud-object-storage.cloud.ibm.com/v2/endpoints.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to successfully update to the current offering endpoints linked above, please open a support ticket for assistance at: https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/form\r\n\r\n/ Event Description /\r\nThis announcement is for COS customers in Sao Paulo 01, Oslo 01, Montreal 01, Mexico 01, Toronto 01, Melbourne 01, Amsterdam 03, Seoul 01, and Chennai 01.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/801a820c542cb7661c4fe73199ca498d0d471cc0/backend/s3/s3.go#L200-L307 should be updated with new endpoints listed in https://control.cloud-object-storage.cloud.ibm.com/v2/endpoints. \r\n\r\nUpdate: docs for S3 backend should be updated to reflect this change\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
