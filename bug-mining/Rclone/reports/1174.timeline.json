One problem with the change was that we had problems testing it. So; I hope you would be able to test a beta build, should we come up with a possible code fix?

In jwt-go v4 we currently use there is an alternative type StandardClaims which matches what box wants.

the StandardClaims implementation from jwt-go v4 directly into rclone's jwtutil. In jwt-go v4 it was marked as deprecated, before removed in v5. The box backend needs this, due to the singular string audience field, see: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7114.\r\n\r\nThis is a possible long-term solution for the jwt-go v4 fix in #7115. Not the best solution, but not the worst either...\r\n\r\nMaybe we should rename our variant from StandardClaims, which is the original name that was used in jwt-go, to something like LegacyClaims - which avoids confusing contributors into thinking this is one to choose by default?\r\n\r\nMaybe we could just go ahead and update jwt-go to v5 as well?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone!
