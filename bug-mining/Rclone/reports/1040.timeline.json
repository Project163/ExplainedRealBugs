you are having with rclone?\r\nI'm trying to upload a single filesystem snapshot to a google drive remote which is 800GB in size. This obviously exceeds the daily user rate limit. The initial file does upload successfully, however is seems when the compress backend attempts to save it's metadata, even when low-level retries is set to 9999999, this fails with rclone crashing. It is interesting that the retries is only 1/1, even with a more sane number of low-level retries set\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.57.0-DEV\r\n\r\nos/version: centos 8 (64 bit)\r\nos/kernel: 4.18.0-358.el8.x86_64 (x86_64)\r\nos/type: linux\r\nos/arch: amd64\r\ngo/version: go1.16.12\r\ngo/linking: dynamic\r\ngo/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nCentos Stream Linux 64bit\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
