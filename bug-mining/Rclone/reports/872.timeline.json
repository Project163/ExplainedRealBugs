the comment:\r\n\r\n> currently there is a mismatch between https://beta.rclone.org/version.txt and https://beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-linux-amd64.zip\r\n> \r\n> version.txt says : \"1.54.0-beta.4903.211b08f77\"\r\n> \r\n> the zip-file contains : rclone-v1.53.3-linux-amd64\r\n\r\nThis is a known oddity in the build process for a point release, which overwrites the current beta.\r\n\r\nAs soon as another beta gets released it will get overwritten.\r\n\r\nThe Release process says this\r\n\r\n```\r\n  * make startstable\r\n  * NB this overwrites the current beta so we need to do this\r\n  * git co master\r\n  * # cherry pick the changes to the changelog\r\n  * git checkout ${BASE_TAG}-stable docs/content/changelog.md\r\n  * git commit -a -v -m \"Changelog updates from Version ${NEW_TAG}\"\r\n  * git push\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that push obviously didn't work - I wonder whether the point release build was still in progress.\r\n\r\nIt should be fixed in a moment though.\r\n\r\nSo in a perfect world we need to stop the build of the point release making a beta, so I'll update the title of this issue to reflect

I've used ansible a small amount in the past so it made some sort of sense.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the `version.txt` and the zip files to get out of sync as you've seen. This issue fixes one of them but it has happened before. There is only ever one directory in the .zip file and that will always have the correct version and arch, so you could update the variables from listing that directory, or just assume that there will always be only one directory.\r\n\r\nAs for other things, you've installed the man page so that is about it I think! Rclone was designed to not need too much installation.\r\n\r\nOne thought - since your ansible role is the most popular - we could make it an official part of rclone and move it under the `rclone` organisation.
