First of all, my bad, I meant [this thread](https://forum.rclone.org/t/add-the-new-google-photos-picker-api-to-rclone/47938), sorry for the confusion.\n\nIt's not a suggested solution per-se of course — Google seems to have retracted from those changes, but we don't know if they're just giving an extension (so sooner than later rclone will break). When that happens, people will come to the forum or docs looking for solutions, and I think that having those Google results ready before \"the disaster\" happens is better than having a bunch of users without an idea of why suddenly rclone stopped working.\n\nSomething along the lines of (which I believe is as neutral as it can be):\n\n``\nGoogle announced the Picker API, deprecating the old Library APIs that rclone uses on March 31st, 2025. That means that rclone will be unable to access photos from your library if they have not been uploaded with rclone. See [Google's 368779600 issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/368779600)\n``\n\nThis way users are aware of what's happening with much effort, plus they can voice their feedback if they wish in the original Google issue. I'm aware that Google doesn't care a lot about the API feedback, but it's also a pity that mostly only the `gphotos-sync` users \"joined forces\" and us, which are equally affected, aren't doing anything, mostly because of ignorance of this matter.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2796667008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ferferga","id":10274099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjc0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10274099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga","html_url":"https://github.com/ferferga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferferga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17222361002,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M6tEQqHzwAAAAQCiF-q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/17222361002","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-11T11:39:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17222361021,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M6tEQqHzwAAAAQCiF-9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/17222361021","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-11T11:39:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2798678782","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8434#issuecomment-2798678782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8434","id":2798678782,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6m0HL-","user":{"login":"germancasares","id":18675185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc1MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18675185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares","html_url":"https://github.com/germancasares","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/germancasares/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-12T06:44:17Z","updated_at":"2025-04-12T06:46:42Z","body":"![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee4d4de-2835-4013-8a81-2974a8663b7c)\n\n>
