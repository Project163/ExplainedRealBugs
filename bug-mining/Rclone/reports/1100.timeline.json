What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nImprove how rclone figure out where an S3 region is located.\r\n\r\nToday it relies on `GetBucketLocation` endpoint but it requires top level permission.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to simply perform an HEAD request to S3 with the bucket as host and it will return its location\r\nin the HTTP response headers.\r\n\r\nYou can see by using:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -v -X HEAD --header \"Host: {bucket}.s3.amazonaws.com\" s3.amazonaws.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd looking for `x-amz-bucket-region` header.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/2431#issuecomment-278725415\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5066\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\nThe documentation of s3manager talks about compatibility issues with FIPS endpoint, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/s3manager/#GetBucketRegion\r\n\r\nNot sure if it would be an issue, could be resolved using a flag but not sure if relevant in rclone's context.\r\n\r\nRegarding tests I'm not quite sure how to do one in this context.\r\n\r\nI had to set a default hint region otherwise it would not work thus I chose rclone's default but it works even for european buckets:\r\n\r\n> 2022/10/29 10:31:04 NOTICE: S3 bucket XXX path CDN: Switched region to \"eu-west-3\" from \"us-east-1\"\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n-
