:-)\r\n\r\nSo you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nAutomatically updating packages might not work or is not desired in downstream distros/packaging like NixOS/nixpkgs. Some flag to disable that feature would be cool.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nAdd a compile time flag to disable the feature.","closed_by":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5187/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
