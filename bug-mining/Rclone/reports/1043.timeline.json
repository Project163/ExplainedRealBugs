It appears that the error is not fatal in the sense that if you delete and re-add the torrent, then re-check the contents, it will continue from where it left off.\r\nEdit: you need to delete the corrupted file, though (which you can see from the logs)\r\n\r\nThe structure of this particular torrent was 75GB with individual files of about 8GB each.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.53.3-DEV\r\n- os/arch: linux/arm64\r\n- go version: go1.15.9\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nRaspbian OS (Raspberry Pi 4), 64bit ARMv8, headless\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n```\r\nrclone mount \\\r\n        --allow-other \\\r\n        --buffer-size 256M \\\r\n        --dir-cache-time 72h \\\r\n        --drive-chunk-size 32M \\\r\n        --fast-list \\\r\n        --log-file /home/pi/rclone_debug.log \\\r\n        --cache-dir /media/mybook/tmp/rclone \\\r\n        --cache-tmp-upload-path /media/mybook/tmp/rclone \\\r\n        --vfs-read-chunk-size 128M \\\r\n        --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit off \\\r\n        --vfs-cache-mode full \\\r\n        --buffer-size 32M \\\r\n        --vfs-read-ahead 10G \\\r\n        --vfs-cache-max-size 1.5T \\\r\n        --vfs-cache-max-age 1000000h \\\r\n        --vfs-cache-poll-interval 5m \\\r\n        Filesystem: /home/pi/gdrive/Filesystem &\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nThis is not possible, but I have the normal logs and will upload them here:\r\n\r\n[rclone_debug.log](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/files/10048175/rclone_debug.log)\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess the errors regarding the \"source file is being updated\" are not relevant and in fact they may be downgraded to `WARNING`.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
