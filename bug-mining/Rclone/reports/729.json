Along with this release comes some improvements to fusefs, outlined here: https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&revision=352351\r\nAnother notable change is the kernel module loaded is now fusefs.ko instead of fuse.ko\r\n\r\nHere is the problem: \r\nAt boot I mount a gdrive using @reboot in my crontab with the following command:\r\n@reboot rclone mount -vvv --allow-other --allow-non-empty --log-file /var/log/rclone.log --fast-list --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit off --timeout 1h --daemon --daemon-timeout 0 cachedrive: /mnt/gcache\r\n\r\nSomething goes wrong and it doesn't mount correctly, an error is attached below.\r\nAll I have to do is rerun the command from my terminal and everything mounts correctly. No other changes were made, just a simple running of the command again. \r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.49.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nFreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nGoogle Drive \r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrclone mount -vvv --allow-other --allow-non-empty --log-file /var/log/rclone.log --fast-list --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit off --timeout 1h --daemon --daemon-timeout 0 cachedrive: /mnt/gcache\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\ngoroutine 31 [running]:\r\nbazil.org/fuse.(*Conn).ReadRequest(0xc000098ba0, 0x162a480, 0xc00040c300, 0x1870580, 0xc0007e4580)\r\n        /wrkdirs/usr/ports/net/rclone/work/rclone-1.49.4/vendor/bazil.org/fuse/fuse.go:1007 +0x5118\r\nbazil.org/fuse/fs.(*Server).Serve(0xc00040c300, 0x18549e0, 0xc0000b3900, 0x0, 0x0)\r\n        /wrkdirs/usr/ports/net/rclone/work/rclone-1.49.4/vendor/bazil.org/fuse/fs/serve.go:414 +0x372\r\ngithub.com/rclone/rclone/cmd/mount.mount.func1(0xc00040c300, 0xc0000b3900, 0xc000098ba0, 0xc000099020)\r\n        /wrkdirs/usr/ports/net/rclone/work/rclone-1.49.4/cmd/mount/mount.go:98 +0x45\r\ncreated by github.com/rclone/rclone/cmd/mount.mount\r\n        /wrkdirs/usr/ports/net/rclone/work/rclone-1.49.4/cmd/mount/mount.go:97 +0x2ee\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
