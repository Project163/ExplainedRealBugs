Guessing works decently well for most files, but I believe this should only be done when absolutely necessary, as fallback for sources that may not provide a explicit mime.\n\nFor example on Rackspace Cloud Files I have a file called `image-1` (no extension) with `Content-Type: image/jpeg`:\n\n```\n$ curl -I http://xxx.cf2.rackcdn.com/image-1\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nETag: 9a9d9f5229c256babf8e80707747e294\nContent-Length: 49583\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\n```\n\nUsing rclone I'm able to copy this perfectly to S3, except the `Content-Type` is lost:\n\n```\n$ curl -I http://xxx.s3.amazonaws.com/image-1\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nETag: \"9a9d9f5229c256babf8e80707747e294\"\nContent-Length: 49583\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n```\n\nInstead of `application/octet-stream` it should be `image/jpeg`\n## \n\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\n\n1.33\n\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nmacOS 10.12, 64 bit \n\n> Which cloud storage system are you using?
