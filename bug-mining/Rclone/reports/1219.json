However, I can't download files without disabling multi-thread-streams `--multi-thread-streams 0`, which nearly halved the transfer speed.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.65.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\n```\r\ndebian 11.8 (64 bit)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocal file system\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\ntruncate --size 1G testfile\r\nrclone serve ftp .\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n551 Error reading file\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

When ftp server fail to write to the transfer connection, it will write an error message despite the data we need is already available right now.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1017\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/assets/28780594/5298fc4f-d88b-4797-a08b-8d80ae8f3466\">\r\n\r\nThe copy is successful, but when closing the connection the error will emerge. By commenting out the `fs.CheckClose` the transfer will be successful without any error.\r\n\r\nRelated [issue](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3942).","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
