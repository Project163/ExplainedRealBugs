We'll reply quickly and it won't increase our massive issue backlog.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea for an improvement, then please search the old issues first and if you don't find your idea, make a new issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThank you very much for all you hard work!\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nBy default, restic [calls rclone](https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/internal/backend/rclone/backend.go#L143-L145) like this:\r\n```\r\nrclone serve restic --stdio --b2-hard-delete --drive-use-trash=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince yesterday, our integration tests break, rclone [exits with an error message](https://travis-ci.com/restic/restic/jobs/135026826#L583):\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone: Error: invalid argument \"--drive-use-trash=false\" for \"--b2-hard-delete\" flag: parsing \"--drive-use-trash=false\" as bool failed: expected newline\r\n```\r\n\r\nI saw that you removed the `pflag` library. It looks like all the boolean flags now need an explicit `true` or `false` value, this seems to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone serve restic --stdio --b2-hard-delete=true --drive-use-trash=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nWas this breaking change intentional (not meant as an accusation, just curious)? I know that `pflag` has too many options for its own good :)\r\n\r\nDo you have an idea on how to mitigate this (also from restic's point of view)? At the moment, the default arguments for `rclone` are hard-coded into the restic binary, but can be overwritten by command-line flags. I'm fearing that users will use an older restic binary with a fresh rclone binary and it won't work out of the box, is there anything we can do?\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.42-DEV\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.10.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux, amd64\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nLocal\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nrclone serve restic --stdio --b2-hard-delete --drive-use-trash=false\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
