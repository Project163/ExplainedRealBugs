Mixing file/folder exclusion with file/folder inclusion is problematic. I spent half a day trying to figure out how to exclude a folder browsing the web, reading the doc and going to the forum. No success.\r\n\r\nMaximum frutstration. We find a nice tool such as *rclone* to solve what we want to do, but we must take an entire day to suit it for our purpose. So many options, choosing the best parameter combination, making trials, etc.\r\n\r\n`Include.txt`\r\n\r\n```\r\n/abc/**\r\n/def/**\r\n/ghi/**\r\n/jkl/**\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Exclude.txt`\r\n\r\n```\r\n/def/xyz/not_this_one/\r\n```\r\nAbove, folders `abc`, `def`, `ghi`, `jkl` resides in my **home** directory.\r\n\r\nThe command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone --include-from Include.txt --exclude-from Exclude.txt sync ~/ Project:/Users/Hilda/MEGA/SAS/\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: the folder `not_this_one/` is still present.\r\n\r\nI combined `--include-from` with `--filter` with no success. Using `--filter`, file `Exclude.txt` would become:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- /def/xyz/not_this_one/\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: not working.
