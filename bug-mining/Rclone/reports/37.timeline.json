Unfortunately I erased the reports of the day 10,11 and 12. If there were no overlap, then that would explain the cause of the duplicates. Although still having overlapping chances are that there has been some condition on the network which could have done that both copying operations had been done in different moments of time. Although would be assumptions.\n\nI'm not sure how else could provide more information.

for doing that testing.  I'm not suprised that running two rclones at exactly the same time causes duplicates - rclone traverses the drive at the start of the run so won't actually notice new files added during the run.\n\nNote that you can examine the duplicates with `rclone lsl` and `rclone md5sum` that will print the duplicates.\n\nI should probably revise my original advice into the FAQ, something like this.  What do you think?\n\n---\n\n### Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time\n\nYou can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose different subdirectory for the output, eg\n\n```\nServer A> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA\nServer B> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB\n```\n\nIf you sync to the same directory then you should use `rclone copy` otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg\n\n```\nServer A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup\nServer B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup\n```\n\nThe file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may make duplicates.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/116612455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/116666164","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/78#issuecomment-116666164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/78","id":116666164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjY2NjE2NA==","user":{"login":"dbareiro","id":7597354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTczNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7597354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro","html_url":"https://github.com/dbareiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbareiro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-29T13:49:21Z","updated_at":"2015-06-29T13:49:21Z","body":"Hi, Nick.\n\nThanks for your reply.\n\nI think it is a successful advice.
