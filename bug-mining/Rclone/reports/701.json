These can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.\r\n\r\nBut that isn't true. For example:\r\n\r\n    $ RCLONE_VFS_CACHE_MODE=writes rclone mount onedrive: /onedrive\r\n    2019/10/10 21:09:37 Couldn't find flag \"vfs-cache-mode\"\r\n\r\nIf I understand it correctly, setDefaultFromEnv() only looks for flag in top-level options:\r\n\r\n    setDefaultFromEnv()\r\n    -> pflag.Lookup()\r\n        -> CommandLine.Lookup()\r\n\r\nSo I think command specific options can't be configured using environment variables? If so, the man page should be fixed. \r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n    $ rclone --version\r\n    rclone v1.49.3-DEV\r\n    - os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n    - go version: go1.12.6\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n     $ lsb_release -a\r\n    No LSB modules are available.\r\n    Distributor ID:\tUbuntu\r\n    Description:\tUbuntu 18.04.2 LTS\r\n    Release:\t18.04\r\n    Codename:\tbionic\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
