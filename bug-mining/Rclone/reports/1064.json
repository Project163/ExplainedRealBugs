We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.53.3-DEV\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15.4\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nManaging multiple remotes.\r\n I use a few google drive + backblaze remotes and it is not quite easy to work with all of them.\r\nMost of the time I want to mount all of them in one particular directory, roughly as follows:\r\n```\r\nrclone mount backblaze:   mount/backblaze\r\nrclone mount gdrive_home:   mount/gdrive/home\r\nrclone mount gdrive_office:    mount/gdrive/office\r\netc..\r\n# also if mount fails then `fusermount -uz` and stuff\r\n```\r\nI've a script to handle mounting but I think it's better if rclone handles this internally.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nRclone can handle all of the mountings as a new remote maybe `combine` or `join`.\r\nSo config can be something like:\r\n```\r\n[all]\r\ntype=combine\r\nremotes=\"backblaze: backblaze, gdrive_home: gdrive/home, gdrive_office: gdrive/office\"\r\n```\r\nNow I just have to manage a single mount.\r\nAs a start I think we should not support nested remotes. And also no remote specific configurations like seperate `--dir-cache-duration`. So all remotes will be leaf in structure and whatever mount config is used for `combine` will apply to all of the remotes.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
