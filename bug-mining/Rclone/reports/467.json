I have an URL with a Macaroon for authentication, like this:\r\n\r\n    https://server/?authz=token\r\n\r\nbut that fails with an \"unauthorized\" error, where curl just gets the file or directory (so the token is fine). In the server log, I saw this URL:\r\n\r\n    https://server/?authz=token//\r\n\r\nSo I tried this URL to \"disconnect\" the // from the token:\r\n\r\n    https://server/?authz=token&\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, that works again! But then I try to upload a file:\r\n\r\n    https://server/?authz=token&/test-webdav\r\n\r\nThis breaks, the server does not understand it. It appears there is not much else I can do with such GET URLs. May I suggest paths are inserted before variables of a GET URL and not appended at the end?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nOnno","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
