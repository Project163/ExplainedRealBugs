understand you are having a problem with rclone or have an idea for an improvement - we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\ninstead of filing an issue.  We'll reply quickly and it won't increase our massive issue backlog.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea for an improvement, then please search the old issues first and if you don't find your idea, make a new issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen using the `rclone <cmd> --help` to lookup the usage of a subcommand, most of the output is taken up by the list of global flags. This forces users to scroll up a lot just to see the relevant help text for the command.\r\n\r\nInstead I would suggest moving this list of global flags to a command like `rclone --help globalflags` or similar, and add a note like `Use \"rclone --help globalflags\" for more information about global flags.` on the bottom of every other help command.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2541/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2541/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
