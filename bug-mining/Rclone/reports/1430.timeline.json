you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis commit adds SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption - Customer) support to the B2 native backend. The server uses a customer provided AES-256 key to encrypt the files when you upload them to the bucket, and then it discards your key from the servers RAM after you're done uploading.\r\n\r\nThe option names and descriptions are based off the S3 backend implementation as the way S3 and B2 does SSE-C is pretty similar.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\nI saw it discussed in #6585.\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution
