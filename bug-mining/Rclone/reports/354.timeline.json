The second attempt copy operation is at 98% without any other B2 500 responses, however if you look at the logs you can see sporadic B2 401 responses occurring in attempt two. These are being handled by your low level retry code. B2 is also offering plenty of 503 responses when busy. Could it be that when B2 is busy uploads of some chunks slow to ridiculously low speeds (>24 hours per chunk) and the authorisation tokens expire? The existing low level retry mechanism appears to cover this, even if rclone aborted long running chunks and requested a new code the result would be the same (retry the chunk). Would rclone be able to request a new access token mid upload (I suspect not)? This may be a symptom of B2 being busy rather than a problem with rclone, sorry if I'm wasting your time.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need anything else, thanks again.\r\n\r\n[rclone.txt](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/files/1284115/rclone.txt)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/327743851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eodrap","id":31686420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjg2NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31686420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap","html_url":"https://github.com/eodrap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eodrap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1249422852,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyNDk0MjI4NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1249422852","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e846bfeb8c490dcaeb85cb14c9c247721b1021f6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/e846bfeb8c490dcaeb85cb14c9c247721b1021f6","created_at":"2017-09-14T15:11:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/329546077","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1660#issuecomment-329546077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1660","id":329546077,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTU0NjA3Nw==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-14T17:02:37Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T17:02:37Z","body":"I

I've restarted the transfer using a wired connection but it's going over the same Powerline switches as the wireless APs so I expect issues to continue.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for rclone / Backblaze to be fault tolerant when individual chunks fail? The behaviour at the moment seems to be that a single chunk fails due to a temporary connection drop and this causes the entire transfer to be restarted. I've set high --retries and --low-level-retries values, these work but still require the full transfer operation to be restarted. I was able to upload with v1.37 after multiple attempts, I've not tested in the earlier version but I've made 4x upload attempts all failing in similar ways (issue with a single chunk brings the whole operation down). rclone sync operations with are fault tolerant by virtue of transferring many small files, this is specific to large file transfer and many chunks.\r\n\r\nApologies if this request is asking for the impossible, I appreciate that the behaviour may be down to the Backblaze API. Thanks again for the brilliant work with rclone.\r\n\r\nHere is some debugging output from rclone -\r\n\r\n```\r\n2017/10/07 18:22:45 DEBUG : xxx: Done sending chunk 37\r\n2017/10/07 18:22:45 DEBUG :
