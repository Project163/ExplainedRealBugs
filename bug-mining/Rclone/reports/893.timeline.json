@ncw \r\n\r\nSo how do I pull these changes? Just simply download the beta version of docker container docker pull rclone/rclone:beta or do I have to pull the latest version? If its beta, when should I expect it to become latest? Thanks again.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/706499917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arkllc","id":59293581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjkzNTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59293581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc","html_url":"https://github.com/arkllc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkllc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3862453139,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg2MjQ1MzEzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3862453139","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-10T06:53:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3862453140,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4NjI0NTMxNDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3862453140","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-10T06:53:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/706504881","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4624#issuecomment-706504881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4624","id":706504881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjUwNDg4MQ==","user":{"login":"darthShadow","id":6824881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjQ4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6824881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow","html_url":"https://github.com/darthShadow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-10T07:34:43Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T07:34:43Z","body":"These have not been done anywhere.
