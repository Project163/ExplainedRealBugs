I chose to delete the temporary backup file so that it is at least not kept around if a user decides to encrypt the config. The old file should probably erased securely when encryption is on, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1105547676,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTEwNTU0NzY3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1105547676","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9cede6b372002a739cca8d5db589c61c6d229bba","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/9cede6b372002a739cca8d5db589c61c6d229bba","created_at":"2017-06-01T07:57:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"calisro","id":5018276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTgyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5018276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro","html_url":"https://github.com/calisro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-05T19:31:24Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T19:31:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1467","id":233680210,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzM2ODAyMTA=","number":1467,"title":".rclone.conf
