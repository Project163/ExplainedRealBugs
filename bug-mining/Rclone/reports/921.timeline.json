The SFTP backend was used concurrently by 26 routines at some point - this would have required 26 connections.\r\n2. There is an SFTP connection leak somewhere, so connections are being made but not returned to the pool.\r\n3. You are creating lots of different SFTP backends - currently the connection pool is never being cleared\r\n\r\nI think looking at your log it is option 3 - you are continually creating SFTP backends. It look like from the log that the backends aren't being re-used though - each request is creating a new backend which is wrong.\r\n\r\nIt looks like you are creating lots of backends very quickly - I wonder if there is a race condition there...\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, this looks like the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nTry this. It should make sure you only create one backend each time. However this still won't flush the connection pool when the backend is removed from the cache - that should be done too.\r\n\r\n[v1.54.0-beta.4992.9b9bf0568.fix-4883-cache](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-4883-cache/v1.54.0-beta.4992.9b9bf0568.fix-4883-cache/) on branch
