behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nNo warnings, prune should complete.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nPrune failed.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior\r\n-------------------------------\r\nBuild restic using Go 1.14 and store the backup repository on a CIFS share.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what may have caused this?\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nThis issue is a side effect of asynchronous preemptions in go 1.14. The [release notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.14#runtime) state the following:\r\n\r\n> This means that programs that use packages like syscall or golang.org/x/sys/unix will see more slow system calls fail with EINTR errors. Those programs will have to handle those errors in some way, most likely looping to try the system call again.\r\n\r\nGo configures signal handlers to restart syscalls if possible. The standard library also retries syscalls when necessary. That is there should only be issues when directly calling low-level syscalls and in that case one should just implement things properly. However, restic just uses go standard library functions that should already handle EINTR if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first prune error message points to an `os.Open` call (via `fs.Open`) in the Load function of the local backend. So it looks like a Go standard library call fails. However, the manpage for signal (man 7 signal) states that the `open` syscall, that is called underneath, is always restarted when using `SA_RESTART` as is done by Go. So this seems to be a bug in the Linux kernel. Adding a loop around the call to `fs.Open` to repeat it as long as EINTR is returned, fixes that one call. Fixing all problematic calls would end up adding lots of ugly loops and playing whack-a-mole.\r\n\r\nThe manpages of lstat, readdir and chmod don't even list EINTR as a possible errno. \r\n\r\nDo you have an idea how to solve the issue?\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nSetting the environment variable `GODEBUG` to `asyncpreemptoff=1` restores the pre Go 1.14 behavior and fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nGo relies on the assumption that the kernel properly restarts syscalls when told to do so. As that latter is obviously not the case, the proper fix would be to submit a bug report to the linux kernel.\r\n\r\nA short-term solution would be to add a note to the restic documentation that mentions the compatibility problem with CIFS mounts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/restic/restic/issues/2659/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/restic/restic/issues/2659/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1240536745","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2042#issuecomment-1240536745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2042","id":1240536745,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5J8Rap","user":{"login":"tooptoop4","id":33283496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjgzNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33283496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4","html_url":"https://github.com/tooptoop4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T10:36:53Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T10:36:53Z","body":"any idea when this will be available?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1240536745/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tooptoop4","id":33283496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjgzNDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33283496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4","html_url":"https://github.com/tooptoop4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tooptoop4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1243633532","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2042#issuecomment-1243633532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2042","id":1243633532,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5KIFd8","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-12T11:59:14Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T11:59:14Z","body":"@tooptoop4 we are looking for someone to work on this.
