recently migrated servers using a backup stored on an encrypted google drive (as the entire thing doesn't fit on the old server). I noticed some programs weren't finding files and rsyncing the files off the old server to the new one resulted in a different file name that was then picked up by the programs. Further to this I noticed the only files this occurred on had accents or dakuten. I'll admit the original filenames are probably _technically wrong_ but rclone needs to be using the actual filename not just what it thinks is better.\r\n\r\nI thought it was an issue with crypt remotes but the same thing occurs regardless of whether it's Google Drive or Google Drive via crypt - likely ruling out it being a remote issue and instead being in how rclone handles character encoding.\r\n\r\nA basic example of what happens is as follows ([tar of the offending filenames](https://helifreak.club/mangle.tar)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n'10 - Polonaise in Ab major Op 53 Héroique.flac'\r\n'10 - Polonaise in Ab major Op 53 Héroique.flac'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two lines will likely render the same in the browser, use a hex editor or similar to see the actual encoding. \r\n\r\nThe first file is uploaded to a crypt remote with the correct filename, it is then renamed to have _bak at the end, the file is then downloaded back from the crypt remote, the _bak is then removed. There are now two files there - at least on Arch ls output shows the first line has the ' higher above the e than the second.\r\n\r\nShould be affecting under 100 of my files so I can rsync them across but I can't delete anything off the new server before confirming whether the filenames themselves are mangled (requiring a reupload of 8 TiB of data, fun) or if it's just occurring during download.\r\n\r\nIt's also occurring with the following filenames (and many others) if it helps in diagnosis:\r\n\r\n```\r\n04 - Wormlust - Sex Augu, Tólf Stjörnur.flac on ó and ö\r\n07 - Nyiþ - Visni Þitt Hold Svo Betur Megi Hæfa Þeim Hug Sem Það Hýsir.flac on ý\r\n09 - Misþyrming - Ég Byggði Dyr í Eyðimökinni.flac on ö\r\n13 ワンダーランド.flac on ダ and ド\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think local filesystem is also ruled out, centOS machine is running ext4, Arch is running ZFS, Arch on WSL is NTFS with its wrapper.\r\n\r\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n\r\nTested on rclone v1.35, rclone v1.36, and rclone v1.36-170-g2ca477c5β\r\n\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\ncentOS 7.2 64 bit, Arch 64 bit, Arch 64 bit via WSL\r\n\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using?
