What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nAs described in the issue: You can have a dir with `:` in the name in a remote. When mounting this with cache on Windows, the current cache code did not handle such characters that are invalid in paths, and it tried (without luck) to create a dir within the cache location containing the `:`.\r\n\r\nWith this change: When cache builds the path to be used within the local file cache for a given remote path, it now relies on `FromStandardPath`, with an encoder that properly handle characters not valid in paths on current os.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what the local backend does: So refactored the default encoder from the local backend into lib/encoder as `OS` encoder, to re-use it.\r\n\r\nAn early version was confirmed to fix the linked issue, but I'm still a bit uncertain if this is the correct/best way to handle it...\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #5360\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution
