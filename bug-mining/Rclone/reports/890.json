We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4.
