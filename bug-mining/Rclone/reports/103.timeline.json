was an issue with downloading larger files. The current [\"official\" maximum file size](https://forums.developer.amazon.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=4610) for ACD is 50GB btw.\n\nAnyhow, what's interesting is that the download of said file works with acd_cli. They have a [git commit](https://github.com/yadayada/acd_cli/commit/8cd8bd950b167160a42c98781153dc4bf3731a72) designated as a workaround for large files involving chunked/ranged downloads (in

no problem. I used the --dump-bodies flag to get more information where things might wrong.\n\nThe 11GB file was uploaded with Cloud Drive Desktop. Here is the associated JSON-encoded metadata (with some IDs removed for privacy reasons):\n\n```\n{\"data\":[{\"eTagResponse\":\"cJwi8ziqd8I\",\"id\":\"<removed>\",\"kind\":\"FILE\",\"version\":3,\"labels\":[],\"contentProperties\":{\"extension\":\"m2ts\",\"size\":11956715520,\"contentType\":\"application/octet-stream\",\"version\":1,\"md5\":\"28909758cf5ef75fc8cfc2a58b2b9317\"},\"createdDate\":\"2015-08-30T12:53:49.238Z\",\"createdBy\":\"CloudDriveDesktop\",\"restricted\":false,\"modifiedDate\":\"2015-08-30T22:14:45.746Z\",\"name\":\"footage.m2ts\",\"isShared\":false,\"parents\":[\"<removed>\"],\"status\":\"AVAILABLE\"}],\"count\":1}\n```\n\nIn comparison, here the metadata from another file that was uploaded through a third party app using the ACD api:\n\n```\n{\"data\":[{\"eTagResponse\":\"VaSg_YDsTa4\",\"id\":\"<removed>\",\"kind\":\"FILE\",\"version\":2,\"labels\":[],\"contentProperties\":{\"extension\":\"cmuprops\",\"size\":80140,\"contentType\":\"application/xml\",\"version\":1,\"md5\":\"0fbab9ecbbdc9ade6d07712348600eeb\"},\"createdDate\":\"2015-08-29T10:17:02.889Z\",\"createdBy\":\"SyncBackPro\",\"restricted\":false,\"modifiedDate\":\"2015-08-29T10:17:03.201Z\",\"name\":\"footage.cmuprops\",\"isShared\":false,\"parents\":[\"<removed>\"],\"status\":\"AVAILABLE\"}],\"count\":1}\n```\n\nNotice how it shows different fields for \"version\"? Anyhow, in the next step, when rclone requests the 11GB file with GET /cdproxy/nodes/<removedid>/content HTTP/1.1, it receives the following response.\n\n```\n2015/11/09 16:38:11 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n2015/11/09 16:38:12 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n2015/11/09 16:38:12 HTTP RESPONSE\n2015/11/09 16:38:12

Amazon-Cloud-Drive\nX-Amzn-Requestid: <requestid>\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThis is different from a normal response which looks like this:\n\n```\n2015/11/09 16:42:14 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n2015/11/09 16:42:15 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n2015/11/09 16:42:15 HTTP RESPONSE\n2015/11/09 16:42:15

302 redirect in the case of the 11GB file, it makes another request query that looks like this:\n\n```\nGET /<removedid>?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22footage.m2ts%22&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream&x-amz-security-token=<token>&AWSAccessKeyId=<accessid>&Expires=1447083792&Signature=<signature> HTTP/1.1\nHost: cd-na-prod-content.s3.amazonaws.com\n```\n\nWhich then causes the HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request error that we've already seen in my first post:\n\n```\n<Error><Code>InvalidArgument</Code><Message>Only one auth mechanism allowed; only the X-Amz-Algorithm query parameter, Signature query string parameter or the Authorization header should be specified</Message><ArgumentName>Authorization</ArgumentName><ArgumentValue>removed</ArgumentValue><RequestId>requestid</RequestId><HostId>hostid</HostId></Error>\n```\n\nPerhaps, if rclone was to strip out the query strings containing the S3-related information that it receives in the 302 redirect response, the error might disappear?\n\nIf you need the full output, I can send it to you via

detective work - the error message now makes sense.\n\nThe redirected request is going to S3 - `cd-na-prod-content.s3.amazonaws.com`\n\nS3 is getting auth info from the URL but rclone will be adding an `Authorization:` line with the oauth credentials for ACD also which is confusing it.\n\nThe best way to fix this is for rclone not to put in the `Authorization:` header if it detects that it has been redirected to S3, or maybe if there is `Signature` in the URL string.\n\nI don't think stripping the query strings will work as then it will be sending ACD auth to S3.\n\nI'm not quite sure how to code this though! Perhaps putting in a redirect policy which stops redirecting when it gets a 301 with a `Signature` in the URL.  The 301 would be returned to the client and it could then do another fetch using a non oauth client...  It might be that this can be fixed in the oauth transport.

Some files will 504 three times and then rclone will exit (it only retries the command three times).... after the third time the file is just on ACD... as far as I can tell all three uploads worked perfectly. While the error message appears almost always on these files the unneeded repetitions only happens maybe 10-20% of the time? or looking over my test files it seems the unneeded repetitions happen always on files greater than 31gb and on files 10-31gb the error message appears but then in the second round the check realizes it doesn't need to repeat and so doesn't.\n\nI'm on ethernet not wireless which is why I didn't just post in this thread: https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/183\n\nedit: here's a quote of an exact error of this type:\n2015/12/24 20:59:52 gigatribe stuff 1.5.7z.003: Failed to copy: HTTP code 504: \"\n504 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT\", no response body\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/169089264","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/204#issuecomment-169089264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/204","id":169089264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTA4OTI2NA==","user":{"login":"JensMagnus","id":3398433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTg0MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3398433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus","html_url":"https://github.com/JensMagnus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JensMagnus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-05T18:27:11Z","updated_at":"2016-01-05T18:28:00Z","body":"Any news?

thanks for the links - I've done some investigation and I think the thing to do for large files on amazon cloud drive would be to request a `tempLink` and download them without auth from that link.\n\n[Getting file metadata section](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/experience/cloud-drive/content/nodes)\n\nThat should be a direct download from S3 which doesn't have any limits.\n\nI haven't tried it yet though - I'll let you know how it goes!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/176887973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
