I can, unless @ll3006 would like to have the honor?\n\nI am working on a prototype. I'll see if I can get it done, but I should mention I'm not overly familiar with Go.\n\nCommit f5f86786b has the original behaviour of 'sync everything, including empty dirs'. It's also the first commit to \"disrespect\" `copyEmptySrcDirs`, adding directories even if they're empty. I've been working on top of this as I find it's the cleanest state before all the emptydir fixes.\n\nCurrently, my implementation idea is as follows:\n- Keep a reference to all dirs that might have their modtime set (much like `setDirModTimes` does)\n- If a dir is verified to be not empty (i.e. when a file from that dir is added)\n    - try doing mkdir on it with metadata/modtime\n    - Otherwise defer metadata/modtime for later \n- Set all deferred metadata/modtimes\n- Eventually also copy empty dirs\n\nI'll have to see if special handling is needed for dirs that have _become_ empty, that is, if all the files in a directory are deleted between two syncs. Since rclone's behaviour is to keep the directory empty, I would expect dir modtimes to also be updated in this case, if changed.\n\nIt will need extensive testing to ensure current behaviour and performance is not impacted.\n\nDo you think this would work?
