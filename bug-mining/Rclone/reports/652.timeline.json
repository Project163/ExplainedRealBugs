Every time I try to do that I get Error 503: Backend Error and Error 500: Internal Error. Sometimes a few files will copy at first, but that's all it does. This command worked fine for me up until about three weeks ago, and has not worked since.

semantics.\r\n\r\nSo setting the mime type is perfectly allowed.  It not working must be classed a s a bug.\r\n\r\nWhat I conjecture is happening is that if you attempt to set the mime type (maybe to something different) then google is doing an actual copy of the file which is taking a very long time (since it is large) and failing after a 90s timeout.  When I tried the above on a large file without mime type it copied instantly indicating drive wasn't copying the actual data (kind of like a hard link on unix).\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure why rclone was setting the mime type - it isn't necessary on a copy at all.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/508376257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/508379281","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3070#issuecomment-508379281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3070","id":508379281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODM3OTI4MQ==","user":{"login":"darthShadow","id":6824881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MjQ4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6824881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow","html_url":"https://github.com/darthShadow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darthShadow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T07:50:31Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T07:50:31Z","body":"I am not really sure whether skipping the mime type is the correct solution, to be honest.
