So I assume this means rclone understands that the source/path are on the same remote? In which case it could also know not to do the delete?

I've fixed this in this beta: http://pub.rclone.org/v1.30-30-g4f2daa6%CE%B2/\n\nI've decided to re-work the way move works to make it more what people expect.\n\nHere is the new help\n\n### move source:path dest:path\n\nMoves the contents of the source directory to the destination\ndirectory. Rclone will error if the source and destination\noverlap.\n\nIf no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move\n`source:path` into `dest:path`. After this `source:path` will no\nlonger longer exist.\n\nOtherwise for each file in `source:path` selected by the filters (if\nany) this will move it into `dest:path`.  If possible a server side\nmove will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server side if possible)\ninto `dest:path` then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in\n`source:path`.\n\n**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the\n--dry-run
