But could not remove such filter and ensure there is no MinAge limit. I mean when you run rclone rcd there is no filter regarding the min age. And the MinAge is 9223372036854776000 by default.\r\n\r\n#### rclone version\r\nrclone v1.49.1\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.3\r\n\r\n#### OS\r\nMultiple OS and versions\r\n\r\n####  Storage\r\nSwift\r\n\r\n#### The command  trying to run\r\n`rclone rc options/set --json '{\"filter\":{\"MinAge\": 9223372036854775807}}\"`\r\n\r\n#### log\r\n\r\nERROR : rc: \"options/set\": error: failed to write options from block \"filter\": Reshape failed to Unmarshal: json: cannot unmarshal number 9223372036854776000 into Go struct field Opt.MinAge of type fs.Duration\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3783/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
