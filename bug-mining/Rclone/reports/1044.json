Here, type of `BytesUsed` is `int`, while it seems it should be `int64`. (Note that `BytesTotal` is `int64`). If I understand correctly (not fluent in Golang), `int` is platform dependent and probably defautls to (signed) 32-bit on my NAS ARM 32-bit CPU. Since I have ~110GB of data stored in mail.ru cloud, it overflows signed 32-bit int.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
