But the \"--stats\" option shows that data is being continuously uploaded (I/O is not idle).

ETA: -\n\nI suspected the \"--timeout\" option which is \"5m\" by default.  When I change \"--timeout\" to 0 (zero), the \"i/o timeout\" error occurs immediately (endless loop, but should disable timeouts).  When I change \"--timeout\" to a long time (ie: \"8h\"), the large files upload successfully without being interrupted.\n\nIt appears that the \"--timeout\" option is falsely interrupting the transfer even though data is being continuously uploaded.  Any insight appreciated.
