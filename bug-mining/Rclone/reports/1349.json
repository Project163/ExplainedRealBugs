We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone version v1.65.2\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nrclone is supporting IBM COS as one of the S3 provider.\r\nBut there is no option to use IBM IAM API key for authentication.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nIBM COS is supporting both [IAM and HMAC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-service-credentials) for authentication. \r\nIAM API Key is the preferred method of authentication for IBM Cloud Object Storage, \r\nas IAM provides better security controls. Onc can create a fine-grained access control policy for their buckets.\r\n\r\nrclone should provide an option to use IBM IAM API Key with IBM COS S3 API Endpoints.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
