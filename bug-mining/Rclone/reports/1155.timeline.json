run into this problem before, after some messing with the golang webdav library and rclone, I believe I found the cause.\r\n\r\nWhen creating webdav server, rclone delegate filesystem operations to vfs, [Mkdir](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/serve/webdav/webdav.go#L254), [OpenFile](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/serve/webdav/webdav.go#L254) etc.\r\n\r\nThe problem is when trying to create a file in a readonly-directory, vfs allocates a [file](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/vfs/file.go#L659), (according to my test, first a vfs file node is allocated, and a write handle is returned). When vfs flushes the content via [openPending](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/vfs/write.go#L59), which is in turn called by [Close](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/vfs/write.go#L185) (debug.PrintStack output, I wonder why none of the write related method is called, but perhaps [resp.Body implemented ReadFrom](https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/webdav/webdav.go#L271)), [rcat will fail](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/vfs/write.go#L71), and [file handle object won't be set](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/vfs/write.go#L203).\r\n\r\nNow that's the first part, when browsing the webdav server, client will send PROPFIND request to fetch the directory listing, which calls [walkFS](https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/webdav/file.go#L758), which in turn open file [read only](https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/webdav/file.go#L775), however openRead requires a [validObject wait](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/vfs/file.go#L511), this check will always fail because\r\n\r\n1. The underlying fs.Object is nil, it's only set when [file handle is closed without error](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/vfs/write.go#L203).\r\n2.
