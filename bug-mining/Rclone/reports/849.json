I'm uploading since 8 days straight now and currently the value is at about 400 MBPS (406479450.72536063). This is absolutely impossible because my upload is 80 times slower. When starting rclone the problem does not occur so this looks like the sum of a few million precision errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nv1.52.3-309-g47d08ac1-beta. I can't use the newest one since I have to let it run for a few days for the error to occur :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nRaspbian OS 32bit\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nJottacloud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4569/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
