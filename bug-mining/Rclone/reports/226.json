Is there an ability to reduce the amount of time/retries for these type of failures?  Currently it waits 24 times (about 2 minutes) to verify the file was not uploaded correctly.  In the end 99.9% of the time the file does not exist and it just re-uploads it.  I'd like to cut down on the time and only try a few times thus reducing the sync times.  \n\n┌[ ✓ robert [/tmp] $\n└─> cat rclone.out | grep Wildflowers\\/folder.jpg\n2016/09/09 09:32:32 &{Music/Tom Petty/Wildflowers/folder.jpg 0xc42013d8f0}: Error detected after finished upload - waiting to see if object was uploaded correctly: HTTP code 429: \"429 Too Many Requests\", reponse body: {\"message\":\"HTTP status code\\u003d[429] RequestId\\u003d[dc28ddba-7691-11e6-b3b6-43cce1d313ba] Rate exceeded\"}\n2016/09/09 09:32:32 &{Music/Tom Petty/Wildflowers/folder.jpg 0xc42013d8f0}: Object not found - waiting (1/24)\n2016/09/09 09:32:37 &{Music/Tom Petty/Wildflowers/folder.jpg 0xc42013d8f0}: Object not found - waiting (2/24)\n2016/09/09 09:32:42 &{Music/Tom Petty/Wildflowers/folder.jpg 0xc42013d8f0}: Object not found - waiting (3/24)\n2016/09/09 09:32:47 &{Music/Tom Petty/Wildflowers/folder.jpg 0xc42013d8f0}: Object not found - waiting (4/24)\n2016/09/09 09:32:52 &{Music/Tom Petty/Wildflowers/folder.jpg 0xc42013d8f0}: Object not found - waiting (5/24)\n2016/09/09 09:32:57 &{Music/Tom Petty/Wildflowers/folder.jpg 0xc42013d8f0}: Object not found - waiting (6/24)\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/712/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/712/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
