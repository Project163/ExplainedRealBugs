might go the following way as a short term solution:\r\n- rollback go.mod \"replace\" hack as per https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5810#issuecomment-972978266\r\n- have users open feature requests\r\n- create a feature branch `ftp` which will accumulate new fixes/features independent of master branch\r\n- open a series of pull requests against the branch with supporting ftp library patches on the `dev` branch of `rclone/ftp`\r\n- open separate pull requests to cherry pick patches from `ftp` when patches from `dev` get accepted upstream\r\n\r\nI'm not happy about it thou. Too much hassle. Higher odds of mistake.\r\nThe alternative is to:\r\n- have users open ftp feature requests\r\n- turn `rclone/ftp` into hard fork, modify backend code appropriately\r\n- maintain rclone master against the fork, add supporting library fixes on fork\r\n- backport library fixes upstream paced to suite their maintainer, stop worrying about dependency or diverging\r\n\r\n@ncw thoughts?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/973141205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5640686721,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M4-tQnCzwAAAAFQNgyB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5640686721","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-18T18:26:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
