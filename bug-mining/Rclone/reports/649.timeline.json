They end with empty object and 200 code result. Tested with both curl and rclone rc.\r\n\r\nYes I can verify this.  The error appears in the log\r\n\r\n    2019/05/07 13:29:58 ERROR : : error reading source directory: directory not found\r\n\r\nBut isn't propagated to the caller.\r\n\r\n> Same request made with CLI is reporting an error (with retries) and exiting with `1`. I've taken a look at the code and it seems that CLI calls are wrapped with `cmd.Run` function which integrates with `accounting` and has retries. This functionality is not available within handler for HTTP server so requests never fail. Although available in the server error logs.\r\n\r\nThat is a very good point.  `cmd.Run` does retries and it also checks the state of the global error flag.\r\n\r\nReading the source directory failing isn't being reported synchronously because you want the sync to run even if it can't read all the source directories.\r\n\r\nit would be easy enough to make an analog of `cmd.Run` for the operations to call.  It will need a lock though as running more than one at once isn't a good idea.\r\n\r\nOr the API of [fs/march](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/fs/march/march.go) needs reconsidering so it can report if anything failed at the end.  I see no reason why `March.Run` shouldn't return the listing error at the end - this would then make the error be returned properly.\r\n\r\nSo, I think you've identified two problems\r\n1. Not all errors are returned to the API\r\n2. Commands are not being retried when they should\r\n\r\nThis is all down to `cmd.Run` not being called.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions\r\n1. Make a version of `cmd.Run` for the API to call\r\n2. Try to make the errors be returned synchronously. We've identified one place in `fs/march` where this is the case, there may be others though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/490062482/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2324058239,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMjQwNTgyMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2324058239","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-07T12:41:01Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2324058366,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIzMjQwNTgzNjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2324058366","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-07T12:41:04Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.48"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/490376904","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3172#issuecomment-490376904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3172","id":490376904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MDM3NjkwNA==","user":{"login":"ajankovic","id":509084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic","html_url":"https://github.com/ajankovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajankovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-08T07:17:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T07:17:25Z","body":"I
