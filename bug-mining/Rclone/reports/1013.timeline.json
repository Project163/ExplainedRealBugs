We've updated the UI to more accurately describe this situation (thanks for the feedback!). Once the change is merged to master, benchmarks for future commits will be able to show the benchmark's diff against the latest successful benchmark on master.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/954244621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kirbyquerby","id":6455350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTUzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6455350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby","html_url":"https://github.com/kirbyquerby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirbyquerby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5536976156,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M48fY9UzwAAAAFKB40c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5536976156","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T21:41:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5536976159,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M48fY9UzwAAAAFKB40f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5536976159","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T21:41:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/954650319","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5659#issuecomment-954650319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5659","id":954650319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M445s7P","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-29T10:58:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-29T10:58:42Z","body":"@ivandeex

I admit I have problems using Github GUI to get from the CI actions page https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/actions/runs/1395533530 though to checks https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/runs/4037305887\r\n\r\nYeah, GitHub's UI is a bit weird in that respect -- unfortunately, while actions and checks behave somewhat similarly, they have some unintuitive differences. The  `Actions` tab of the repository only shows results from _actions_, not from _checks_. The way I got to your checks run from your commit was:\r\n1. I visited the commit's page: https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/commit/996247e33ebe41e82f2b433385c012a551fe12de\r\n2. I clicked the little green check mark to the left of the commit title (if the checks are still running, it will be a yellow circle. Or if any checks failed, it will be a red X):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6455350/139475175-57427856-698b-4612-bb0f-cdabc8473ffe.png)\r\n3. This brought up a scrollable list of all of the checks and actions. At the bottom was bencher's check:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6455350/139475245-2099599d-d678-46fb-a4e0-c8169e9f640e.png)\r\n4. I clicked the \"details\" link, which took me to https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/runs/4037305887\r\n\r\nOn a PR, the information is surfaced a bit more easily, as the `Checks` tab shows both _checks_ and _actions_ (eg https://github.com/kirbyquerby/test-gobencher/pull/17/checks) . Unfortunately I'm not aware of a more obvious way to get to the checks page without making a PR. We can definitely update our documentation to show how to get to the benchmark results page from a commit.\r\n\r\n> After fixing the benchmark I repeated the commit with a different commit message. Now I have two commits with working benchmarks. Still nothing on the Bencher dashboard:\r\n\r\nThe issue is that **there are no previous successful benchmarks on master** (the \"base branch\"), so we have nothing to compare against when showing benchmark results. Ordinarily, bencher would populate this itself but this step failed because the benchmarks on master currently fail:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6455350/139480269-20aa2d8c-018e-4a14-b62d-bf991dbb6606.png)\r\n\r\nOnce the change fixing the benchmarks is merged to master, new PRs/commits will have results, such as:\r\nhttps://dashboard.github.orijtech.com/benchmark/5138fac076f244b5b7dbae8aa5c36305\r\n\r\nThanks again for the feedback, and please let me know if anything's still
