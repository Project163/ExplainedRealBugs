As I said, not due to a rclone fault!\n\nLooks like that the issue can only be solved by the team of the used library.\n\nI know one cannot expect and should not ask for response times around FOSS. It would even not be polite. And moreover when the solution is depending on another party ...\n\nMy personal view, without any more insight, is that this might need long time for solution, if any... As such, this would imply that I (and anyone in the need) would be needing to find another solution for mega access.\n\nCould you share your view about a timeframe to expect a solution for the issue? (no commitment asked, only for your impression, no one to blame if prediction fails ...). Taking into account your knowledge/patching to the library, might be you can have an authoritative answer...\n\nBest,\nCT\n\nNB:\nNot trying at all to publicize any competing code, but anyone in the need, besides using browser access, I would try https://xff.cz/megatools/ and not MEGA proprietary headless code. MEGA being more oriented to sync, megatools is closer in use to rclone, and it is also open and free code. On the playing field since 2013.\nAccording megatools site, it caters with the 402 issue. (Changelog - megatools 1.11.5 - 2025-07-06 - This release implements mega.nz X-Hashcash to handle 402 status responses as suggested by a user. This should handle 402 errors returned by mega.nz.)\nNot that I recommend to ditch rclone at all!\nNot that I intend to press the rclone team at all!\nI used megatools in the past; pretty secure and robust; switched to rclone for many features one essential its ability to handle in a unified way many remotes. On the other hand, megatools (independent, free, open source, not based in libraries) is a solution focused in mega. No, I have no links to the developer, and yes, I am an ex-happy user.\nYour mileage might vary.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3236995151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"caspertone2003","id":4682903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODI5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4682903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003","html_url":"https://github.com/caspertone2003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19411544096,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M7GkZqGzwAAAASFBKgg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19411544096","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-29T13:11:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19411544113,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M7GkZqGzwAAAASFBKgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19411544113","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-29T13:11:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19411636598,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M7GkZqGzwAAAASFBhF2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19411636598","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-29T13:16:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19411636624,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M7GkZqGzwAAAASFBhGQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19411636624","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","grav
