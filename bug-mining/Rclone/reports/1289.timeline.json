Are there any test suites for rclone+s3 ?\r\n\r\nThe best way to test is using [the integration tests](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#backend-testing). In brief you can run `go test` while in the `backend/s3` directory provided you've set up a `TestS3:` remote. This tests nearly all the backend features, so iterate until this passes. (Or use your existing remote with `go test -remote mys3remote:`)\r\n\r\nTo run all the integration tests you would then (from the source root)\r\n\r\n    go install ./...\r\n    test_all -remotes TestS3:\r\n\r\nWhich will run rclone's integration tests for sync/operations/vfs/backend/etc against `TestS3:` which is the comprehensive test! The integration test machine is configured to run this against quite a few different s3 providers.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't test the incredibly varied matrix of client configurations though - there aren't unit tests for
