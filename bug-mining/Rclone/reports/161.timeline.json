didn't match for the local file system.\n\nSo when rclone came to copy the local file it didn't know it was supposed to be over-writing an existing file and hence created a duplicate.\n\nThis explains the consistent 409 errors perfectly.\n\nBut why is that happening?\n\nIs it possible that your excludefolder doesn't have the same case as the actual folder in your local fs?\n\nHmm, or I wonder if it is the `--min-age 30d` that is the problem.  ACD doesn't support date based syncing but it will still be applying `--min-age 30d` to the folder which it shouldn't be. So if your file on ACD is > 30d old, but the file on the local file system is < 30d old then this would explain the problem perfectly.  The dates on ACD are the time the file was uploaded.\n\nDoes that make sense to you?\n\nCan you verify this please?  If you send me the results of these two commands I can check the dates and make sure that makes sense (or you can if you prefer - just find a file whch had a 409 conflict and compare the dates for it).\n\n```\nrclone lsl /home/user/localfiles/\nrclone lsl remoteacd:backup/folder\n```\n\nSo assuming this is the problem, then I need to make the destination fs filtering ignore times and sizes (basically anything which could be changed by a new upload).\n\nI'm going to consider the whole copy logic too as the equivalent problem with google drive is a duplicated file.  Getting the Upload method to check for an existing file first would slow things down though.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/225348571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/225459530","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/483#issuecomment-225459530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/483","id":225459530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTQ1OTUzMA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-12T20:50:09Z","updated_at":"2016-06-12T20:50:09Z","body":"I realised the above approach won't work so here is a different tack - check in acd and drive to see if the file exists before uploading.
