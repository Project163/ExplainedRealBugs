Nick.\n\nThank you very much for your answer.\n\nYes, I had seen the issue #28, but I wanted to mention the inconvenience I was having in case it was not related to that.\n\nThis is the version of rclone I'm using:\n\n```\n# ./rclone -V\nrclone v1.13\n```\n\nIt is the binary version downloaded from [here](http://rclone.org/downloads).\n\nI found this problem by transferring a large amount of data (approximately 2.5 GB). After deleting all the data and re-do a new attempt, these were the results:\n\nInitial synchronization:\n\n```\nTransferred:   2814288092 Bytes ( 238.09 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 8\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:        23384\nElapsed time:  3h12m23.442490003s\n```\n\nHere I see a transfer time too high. Is  \"normal\" that it happen or it may be related to the retries? Considering the message `User rate limit exceeded, userRateLimitExceeded` that I mentioned above, I have conducted several tests using the `--bwlimit=` option (gradually decreasing the value looking to find some where I don't get this message) reaching values as low as 50k and still I got the message `User rate limit exceeded`.\n\nBut these errors appear randomly. For example, on a second synchronization on the data transferred earlier, no errors occur and 9 files are transferred (I guess the files related to the previous 8 errors):\n\n```\nTransferred:       468865 Bytes (   1.90 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:             23375\nTransferred:            9\nElapsed time:  4m0.498335311s\n```\n\nA third synchronization finishes without errors, but with a duplicate file:\n\n```\n[...]\n\n2015/05/19 16:55:35 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg: Duplicate file detected\n2015/05/19

errors, and two duplicate files (well, actually occurs twice the message of \"Duplicate file detected\" for the same file as in the previous synchronization)\n\n```\n[...]\n\n2015/05/19 17:02:11

interesting - thank you.\n\nDrive seems to have some quite serious rate limiting.  It will take large files very quickly but it doesn't like lots of small files.  In my testing the limit is about 2 per second which agrees quite well with your initial transfer.\n\nThe second transfer cleaned up the errors as expected, then in that and subsequent transfers it is uploading the same file again and again, duplicating it each time.\n\nThe problem almost certainly ocurred during the initial transfer.\n\nSo\n- rclone doesn't think that file has been uploaded for some reason\n- so it transfers it again\n- however it was there so becomes duplicated\n\nOnce you have a duplicate then I can see a mechanism for you getting another on each transfer.\n\nQuestions\n- That file has a non ASCII character in it.  Is it the only one or are there others with that character in?\n- Can you do an `rclone lsl remote:Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com` and grep out the lines which mention that file and post them here?

I'd expect there to be 5 or so.\n\nThis is the output I get:\n\n```\n# ./rclone lsl remote:Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com | grep fileadmin | grep upload | grep Zahntechnik_Aufza\n2015/05/20 05:02:51 \nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:              6557\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  1m0.392127617s\n\n   418806 2010-08-11 12:56:04.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg\n   418806 2010-08-11 12:56:04.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg\n   418806 2010-08-11 12:56:04.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg\n   418806 2010-08-11 12:56:04.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg\n   418806 2010-08-11 12:56:04.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg\n   418806 2010-08-11 12:56:04.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg\n   418806 2010-08-11 12:56:04.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg\n   492771 2010-08-11 12:55:58.000000000 zahnarzt.berlin.to/20150518/tree/fileadmin/user_upload/right_images/Zahntechnik_Aufzahlung-3.jpg\n2015/05/20 05:03:51 \nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:             10854\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  2m0.38624635s\n\n2015/05/20 05:04:51 \nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:             21170\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  3m0.387870185s\n\n\nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:             23390\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  3m23.162862096s\n```\n\nI think the first seven files are what interest us.\n\n> - Can you use the drive web interface to verify that the there are the same number and sizes of that file?

This limitation has nothing to do with the implementation of `rclone` itself, but will be a limitation that would affect any client attempting to connect to Google Drive, right?\n\nIn the latter case, I think it would be impractical try to use Google Drive as a repository for transfer of high volume of data. That is, now I'm trying to transfer the backup of only two sites (2.5 GB).

This limitation has nothing to do with the implementation of rclone itself, but will be a limitation that would affect any client attempting to connect to Google Drive, right?\n\nThat is correct.\n\n> In the latter case, I think it would be impractical try to use Google Drive as a repository for transfer of high volume of data. That is, now I'm trying to transfer the backup of only two sites (2.5 GB). But if I wanted to transfer the backup of all sites (30 GB or so), transfer times would be extremely high and would make this impractical.\n\nNote that it is only the upload of new files that appears to be rate limited.  So if you are repeatedly copying the same filesystem structure then rclone will only copy the differences and this will be quick provided not too many files have changed - that is what I'd recommend.\n\nNote that I'm planning to make a `--retry` flag which will automatically retry if there were errors in the transfer which would automate this process.\n\nI'm halfway through making a server side copy command which would mean you could do bandwidth efficient daily backups like this (without downloading everything and uploading it to copy it which is what will happen if you try these commands with the current rclone!)\n\n```\n# Do the sync - this will be an incremental\nrclone sync /path/to/directory drive:backup/current\n# Make a copy with todays date\nrclone copy drive:backup/current drive:backup/201505021\n```\n\n> Although perhaps there is some other storage system (compatible with rclone) which does not have this strong limitation on the transfer rate that has Google Drive.\n\nNone of the other rclone backends have this limitation. There are loads of swift providers (Memset Memstore, Rackspace Cloud Files, Runabove, etc) which are reasonably priced.  There is also Google \n Cloud Storage and Amazon S3.\n\n---\n\nThanks for trying out with `--transfers=1`.\n\n---\n\nThe mostly likely cause of duplicate files does seem to be the non ASCII characters...  rclone can handle UTF-8 characters just fine, but it looks like you have a character in the latin1 encoding since it isn't showing properly in my browser...\n\n**I've managed to replicate the problem**  - attempting to transfer an invalid utf-8 filename seems to cause the problem.  So what is happening is your filesystem encoding for file names is set to latin1 - however rclone assumes it is utf-8 so is reading what is invalid utf-8 strings and sending them to drive.  Drive doesn't like them so it converts them into the invalid unicode character '\\ufffd'.  So when rclone reads the files back the name it is expecting isn't there and it uploads it again.\n\nSolutions for rclone...\n- rclone can do this substitution itself - that will fix the problem however it is losing the meaning of the latin1 encoded files\n  - [encoding of file names](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2089/what-charset-encoding-is-used-for-filenames-and-paths-on-linux) is a bit of a mess on linux\n  - [mac encoding](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9757843/unicode-encoding-for-filesystem-in-mac-os-x-not-correct-in-python)\n  - [windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2050973/what-encoding-are-filenames-in-ntfs-stored-as)\n\nI need to check whether Go translates windows/mac filenames into UTF-8 (I think it does).\n\nWhich platform are you using?

That is, now I'm trying to transfer the backup of only two sites (2.5 GB). But if I wanted to transfer the backup of all sites (30 GB or so), transfer times would be extremely high and would make this impractical.\n> \n> Note that it is only the upload of new files that appears to be rate limited. So if you are repeatedly copying the same filesystem structure then rclone will only copy the differences and this will be quick provided not too many files have changed - that is what I'd recommend.\n\nYes, it works like `rsync`, as stated on the site (`rsync` for cloud storage) :-). I think I had it in mind. But my idea was to keep a history of backups per day. For this I was using a backup server which synchronized sites on a remote server with [Dirvish](http://www.dirvish.org) (do you know Dirvish?), minimizing the disk space used by implementing hardlinks to files that do not change regarding to the previous backup. But Google is not aware of this. For Drive these files in each directory are a full copy, which prolongs the time of transfer. But I think I've found a way to reduce the transfer time to Google. I make a tarball of each daily image generated by Dirvish and then I upload that images to Drive. Check this out:\n\n```\n# ./rclone copy /space/tarbackup_tmp remote:Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com\n2015/05/21 11:27:23 Google drive root 'Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com': Building file list\n2015/05/21 11:27:23 Google drive root 'Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com': Waiting for checks to finish\n2015/05/21 11:27:23 Google drive root 'Backup/ps382038.dreamhostps.com': Waiting for transfers to finish\n2015/05/21 11:28:23\nTransferred:    968097792 Bytes (15608.61 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            0\nElapsed time:  1m0.569663993s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz, zahnarzt.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:29:23\nTransferred:   1848886861 Bytes (14974.61 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            1\nElapsed time:  2m0.57433242s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz, zahnarzt.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:30:23\nTransferred:   2803091021 Bytes (15159.67 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            1\nElapsed time:  3m0.570781467s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz, zahnarzt.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:31:23\nTransferred:   3693325507 Bytes (14992.48 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            2\nElapsed time:  4m0.571558404s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz, zahnarzt.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:32:23\nTransferred:   4534283459 Bytes (14731.94 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            2\nElapsed time:  5m0.572198965s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz, zahnarzt.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:33:23\nTransferred:   5273837502 Bytes (14283.32 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            3\nElapsed time:  6m0.57660518s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:34:23\nTransferred:   5872836542 Bytes (13636.59 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            3\nElapsed time:  7m0.573628968s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:35:23\nTransferred:   6472622014 Bytes (13152.96 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            3\nElapsed time:  8m0.570143115s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz\n\n2015/05/21 11:36:23\nTransferred:   7047329645 Bytes (12731.09 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            3\nElapsed time:  9m0.57880906s\nTransferring:  kg.berlin.to_20150518.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150519.tar.gz, kg.berlin.to_20150520.tar.gz\n\n\nTransferred:   7138866563 Bytes (12321.15 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 0\nChecks:                 0\nTransferred:            6\nElapsed time:  9m25.819635937s\n```\n\nThus I did not get the message `User rate limit exceeded` or `Invalid Credentials, authError`\n\n> Note that I'm planning to make a --retry flag which will automatically retry if there were errors in the transfer which would automate this process.\n\nThat would be great! :-)\n\n> I'm halfway through making a server side copy command which would mean you could do bandwidth efficient daily backups like this (without downloading everything and uploading it to copy it which is what will happen if you try these commands with the current rclone!)\n\nThis sounds interesting. Could you elaborate a bit more about how it would work?\n\n> ```\n> # Do the sync - this will be an incremental\n> rclone sync /path/to/directory drive:backup/current\n> # Make a copy with todays date\n> rclone copy drive:backup/current drive:backup/201505021\n> ```\n\nIt has not been clear to me how this works in each of the two cases. `sync` would be a new option that you will implement? Because on the [documentation](http://rclone.org/drive/) I've only seen `copy` for Google Drive. For the second case I think you are copying the contents of a directory to another directory within the same account of Google Drive. But in the first case I'm not sure what it does.\n\n> > Although perhaps there is some other storage system (compatible with rclone) which does not have this strong limitation on the transfer rate that has Google Drive.\n> \n> None of the other rclone backends have this limitation. There are loads of swift providers (Memset Memstore, Rackspace Cloud Files, Runabove, etc) which are reasonably priced. There is also Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3.\n\nJust I chose the one that is limited. What a bad luck :-D But it is expected that the services are paid do not have these limitations. When you talk about _swift providers_ you mean services using [this](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift) protocol?\n\n> The mostly likely cause of duplicate files does seem to be the non ASCII characters... rclone can handle UTF-8 characters just fine, but it looks like you have a character in the latin1 encoding since it isn't showing properly in my browser...\n\nBut these files with non-ASCII characters can generate duplicates only when they themselves try to be transferred or can it generate duplicates on files without no-ASCII characters too? Because I still do not understand what may have been the cause of duplicate files without non-ASCII character mentioned in the initial message of this issue.\n\n> I've managed to replicate the problem - attempting to transfer an invalid utf-8 filename seems to cause the problem. So what is happening is your filesystem encoding for file names is set to latin1 - however rclone assumes it is utf-8 so is reading what is invalid utf-8 strings and sending them to drive. Drive doesn't like them so it converts them into the invalid unicode character '\\ufffd'. So when rclone reads the files back the name it is expecting isn't there and it uploads it again.\n\nIt is a great news that you could replicate this and already you have a new version that fixes this bug. I appreciate your time and it is also a pleasure to have contributed reporting this problem.\n\nThese are the `locales` that I'm using on the backup server, which matches with the `locales` used on the server that maintains the sites. As I said before, the files are synchronized by the backup server using Dirvish (`rsync`). Responding to one of your questions, both are GNU/Linux.\n\n```\n# locale\nLANG=\nLANGUAGE=\nLC_CTYPE=\"POSIX\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"POSIX\"\nLC_TIME=\"POSIX\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"POSIX\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"POSIX\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"POSIX\"\nLC_PAPER=\"POSIX\"\nLC_NAME=\"POSIX\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"POSIX\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"POSIX\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"POSIX\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"POSIX\"\nLC_ALL=\n```\n\nRegarding to where was that file created, I could not confirm. The file was an image (Zahntechnik_Aufza�hlung-2.jpg) so maybe it could have been created by a designer in his own computer.\n\nThanks again for your time.\n\nBest
