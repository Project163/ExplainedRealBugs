I am a developer in OCI and reached out to internal relevant team,  which confirmed that it is not supported to associate S3 compatible credentials for resource principals, instance principals. \r\n\r\nThis makes the use of rclone on OCI instances cumbersome as user credentials needs to be pulled down, saved to local disk to make rclone work. \r\n\r\nI am thinking to add native backend support for OCI Object Storage. Filing this issue as a prerequisite to receive any feedback or comments. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-a-new-backend","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6299/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
