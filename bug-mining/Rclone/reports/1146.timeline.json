What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nWhen using option `no_versions` with the Jottacloud backend, uploading a file will first delete any existing - using the permanent (\"hard\") delete option. In contrast to regular delete, the permanent delete api request will fail with 404 if path is not found. If, for whatever reason, this should occurr, it would lead to upload error:\r\n\r\n> Failed to copy: failed to remove old object: error 404: no.jotta.backup.errors.NoSuchFileException: File /xxxxxx/Jotta/Archive/test.txt does not exist (Not Found)\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nI think this will solve https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6857.
