I would love to see this functionality brought to Dropbox in the form of `--dropbox-impersonate <dropbox-account-id>`\r\n\r\n*Docs:* The feature is a a part of the [buisness api](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/teams#teams-member-file-access), \r\n\r\n*Creds:* A Dropbox admin needs to provision a key with the *Team member management* scope. \r\n\r\n*REST API Specifics:* The only real change to api calls is the addition of an extra header in the request; `Dropbox-API-Select-User: team_member_id`\r\nUnfortunately you are required to provide the member-id, rather than a email address, but this is the only odd bit.\r\n\r\n*[golang client](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-go-unofficial/blob/master/dropbox/files/client.go)*: You configure the client with `dbx.Config.AsMemberID`\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your time and happy rclone-ing :)\r\n\r\n-Jake","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
