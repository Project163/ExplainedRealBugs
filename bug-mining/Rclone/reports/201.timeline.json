So what I guess happened is that the first try failed but the second succeeded - hence the non-0 exit code.\n\n... and because you are using -q you won't be seeing the \"Attempt %d/%d failed with %d errors\" about to retry errors in the log. You'll see these without -q.\n\nInstead of using -q you could use `--stats=0` for a little bit more log but not much and you'll get to see the retries.\n\nMaybe the retry logs should be visible with -q since there will already have been a report of the error.\n\nNote that with -q mode you'll still get all error level reports.
