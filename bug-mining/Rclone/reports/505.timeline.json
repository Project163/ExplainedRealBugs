have given it a shot. I was a bit confused about the logic around default (and several of them) vs custom path, but made it so that the description of `--config` from `rclone -h` reports what would have been used as path by default if `--config` was not specified. E.g. `rclone --config \\path\\to\\my.config -h` reports default path to be according to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (or $HOME) and not considering the path given by `--config`. The main change is that when `--config` (or `RCLONE_CONFIG`) is specified there is no attempt at creating folders, so for instance if no existing config file or rclone config directory exists and XDG_CONFIG_HOME is specified then the default is reported to be $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf without checking that it is actually possible to create it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/417940926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1823648096,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgyMzY0ODA5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1823648096","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"09d7bd2d40a633d315c7a0e751b3a67ab8c85690","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/09d7bd2d40a633d315c7a0e751b3a67ab8c85690","created_at":"2018-09-03T14:30:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/418132711","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2514#issuecomment-418132711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2514","id":418132711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODEzMjcxMQ==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-03T14:33:08Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T14:33:08Z","body":"@albertony thanks for fixing it -
