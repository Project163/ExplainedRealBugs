Note that despite the folder path ending up escaped, the text file `｜.txt` is NOT escaped. \r\n```\r\n@echo off\r\nchcp 65001\r\n\r\nmkdir c\r\nmkdir ｜\r\necho \"hello world\" > c/｜.txt\r\nrclone --config=\"\" copy c ｜\r\ndir ｜\r\npause\r\n```\r\nSpecifically, it causes statements like `rclone copy <somewhere> .` to spontaneously miss if `.` expands to a path with a Full Width replacement character.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
