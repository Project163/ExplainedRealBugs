Here is a prioritized list:\n\n1) --max-size and --min-size.  Why? - with backing up to cloud storage, it is important not to waste time accidentally backing up a 2GB movie file or something when you're backing up someone's Documents folder...\n\n2) --exclude-from.  I hope you will stick as closely as you can to Rsync's exact behavior here.  The AWS CLI team is going off and reinventing the wheel with their exclude/include function and it's really frustrating/unecessary, when the rsync community has spent years coming up with an elegant and totally functional solution.  The best part about rsync's is you can list the excludes in a file, so the actual command remains elegant and easy to read.\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/27/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
