recently received https://github.com/anacrolix/dms/issues/73#issuecomment-606762705 to anacrolix/dms, and in following the link to https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/66e08e0cc8972000d84a61f262286f5644d9fdee/cmd/serve/dlna/cds.go found the code to be remarkably familiar. I see that this was copied in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/2648. I believe the BSD 3-Clause license allows modifications, but requires a copyright notice whether modifications are made or not, and there does not appear to be any such license notice in rclone. The changes since made look very positive, and it would be great if an attempt was made to upstream those, as there is significant overlap with issues currently reported against anacrolix/dms, and the internals which are currently copied and modified, and still linked into are intended to be used more broadly such as they are in rclone.
