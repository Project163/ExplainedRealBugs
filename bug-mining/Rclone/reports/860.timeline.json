What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nI am backing up some LucidLink storage (a cloud storage provider that mounts with its daemon as a fuse space) to Google Drive, and links don't get copied because of a \"detected corruption\". The issue seems similar to #4581, however it persists even in the last beta.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, it seems to be a problem only with files stored on the Lucid mount, as I confirm that copying symlinks that exist on a traditional filesystem works just fine. Copying a directory with links from the Lucid mount to my homedir and retrying the copy from there makes everything work, so the bug definitely exists between the interaction of the two tools.\r\n\r\nHowever, symlinks exist properly within the lucid virtual filesystem and are otherwise properly behaving and working in any other app I tried so far (I have been using them extensively since a while niw). I can't get my head around why rclone should fail.\r\n\r\nThis is the test layout I am trying to copy over:\r\n```\r\n~/Lucid \r\n❯ file testdir/*\r\ntestdir/link-dir:  symbolic link to test1\r\ntestdir/link-file: symbolic link to test2\r\ntestdir/test1:     directory\r\ntestdir/test2:     empty\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n`v1.54.0-beta.5087.3e986cdf5`\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux (Elementary OS - Ubuntu LTS)\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
