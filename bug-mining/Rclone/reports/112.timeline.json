have a Drive on Google Apps for Education - and sync is not catching all the files.\n\nInvestigating further, I noticed:\n# rclone@phoenix:/vol/kdldata/GoogleDriveBackup$ /usr/local/bin/rclone

0\n# Elapsed time:       59.8s\n\nStarting a recursive listing from one level higher in the drive tree is causing certain files AND folders lower down to disappear from the source listing. The missing files/folders are consistent with what is not on the local target after a sync operation.\n\nThis suggests a problem with the recursion algorithm.\n\nNB - files are owned by various people but I have access to all.\n\nTo see how many missing files there are:\n# /usr/local/bin/rclone --stats=0 ls 'twatts_kdl:/Shared Drive/' | wc -l\n#220\n# /usr/local/bin/rclone --stats=0 ls 'twatts_kdl:/' | grep 'Shared Drive' | wc -l\n#157\n\nSo it is missing 63 files!\n\nInvestigating further, I produced a list of the missing files.\n\nEvery single missing file is a Google Doc. Many of them were created or imported by me and reside in a tree where I created every node, so that seems to rule out it getting confused over permissions.\n\nIf I select my whole Google Drive in Chrome, do a \"Download\", unpack the zipfile and look in the \"Shared Drive\" directory and run \"find -type f | wc -l\" I get 220 files, the expected number, which is a further verification that I have permissions. My account is also the GA4Education admin account.\n\nHappy to help debug this -\n\nCheers, Tim Watts\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
