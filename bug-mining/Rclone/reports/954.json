:-) We understand you are having a problem with rclone; we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum:\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\ninstead of filing an issue for a quick response.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\n**rclone** attempts to connect via HTTPS on port 443 even when configured as HTTP.  This fails with a connection refused error, since this local SharePoint server is HTTP on port 80 only.  My ultimate goal is to bulk upload everything from this legacy on-premise SharePoint server to a secure cloud instance.  (**rclone** is working well for the cloud end, just not this local local end.)  I looked at the various available SSL related switches, none seemed appropriate.  Did I miss something important in the config?  Please advise, thank you.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat /home/user/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\r\n\r\n[localsharepoint]\r\ntype = webdav\r\nurl = http://sharepoint.example.org/\r\nvendor = sharepoint\r\nuser = user@example.org\r\npass = xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.48.0\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\n```\r\nLinux unit.example.org 5.3.11-100.fc29.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue Nov 12 20:41:25 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
