To respond with some thoughts:\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I like the user interface, but I really like the idea behind it.\r\n\r\nThank you! I'm far from insistent on the interface or the output, so feel free to play with the concept all you want. To differentiate, I'm thinking of \"interface\" as \"what I type to get the info\", and \"output\" as \"what info gets displayed\".\r\n\r\nOne thing you _could_ do is publish a JSON file with maybe a bit more data in it somewhere (where the aforementioned version file would go, or along-side it). Maybe it looks something like this:\r\n\r\n> Admittedly this is just a first crack without much (any) planning so probably not perfect\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"versions\":\r\n  {\r\n    \"latest\": \r\n    {\r\n      \"version\":\"1.4.1\",\r\n      \"release_date\":\"2018-MM-DD 13:54:00 UTC\",\r\n      \"source\":\"https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/tag/v1.41\",\r\n      \"platforms\":\r\n      [\r\n        {\r\n          \"macos\":\r\n          {\r\n            \"files\":\r\n            [\r\n              {\r\n                \"arch\": \"x64\",\r\n                \"download\": \"https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/download/v1.41/rclone-v1.41-osx-amd64.zip\",\r\n                \"checksums\":\r\n                [\r\n                  { \"md5\":  \"...\" },\r\n                  { \"sha1\": \"...\" }\r\n                ]\r\n              },\r\n              {\r\n                \"arch\": \"i386\",\r\n                \"download\": \"https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/download/v1.41/rclone-v1.41-osx-386.zip\",\r\n                \"checksums\":\r\n                [\r\n                  { \"md5\":  \"...\" },\r\n                  { \"sha1\": \"...\" }\r\n                ]    \r\n              }\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"windows\":\r\n          {\r\n            \"_comment\":\"repeat the structure, you get the idea\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"previous\":\r\n  {\r\n    \"_comment\":\"same as latest, just with appropriate values for that version\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Obviously that should be minified without whitespace for production.)\r\n\r\nBy doing something like this, you've got a canonical, singular source of truth for the _two most recent_ release versions, and by having this, not only can `rclone` fetch it and display whatever the user asks for (notes on that below), **but automation tools can count on this file being available too, so they can script against it and have an always up-to-date singular source of information** so they can automate builds, update installations, etc. however they want.\r\n\r\nSo now that we have more data in a way that's sort of \"universally\" useful...\r\n\r\n> Examples of my current thinking (unrefined)\r\n\r\nThe first thing that occurs to me is, perhaps: `rclone version --check [-v|-vv]`\r\n\r\nAdding a `--check` flag could be what we need to differentiate it enough so that some one has to _purposefully_ ask for this information before getting it unexpectedly. With `-v`, rclone could output a _little_ more information, or with `-vv` it could give them a _lot_ (as it pertains to the user's platform).\r\n\r\nExample concept:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone version --check\r\n   yours:   1.4.1\r\n   latest:  1.4.3\r\n   upgrade:\r\n       https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/tag/v1.43\r\n\r\n#\r\n# This example is for a MacOS x64 install.\r\n# For other platforms the output would be adjusted accordingly\r\n#\r\n\r\n$ rclone version --check -v\r\n   yours:   1.4.1\r\n   latest:  1.4.3 (released 2018-09-22)\r\n   upgrade:\r\n       https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/tag/v1.43\r\n   download:\r\n       https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/download/v1.43/rclone-v1.43-osx-amd64.zip\r\n\r\n#\r\n# An example for a Linux i386 run (for contrast) using -vv\r\n# Here I'm showing just the match of platform in \"latest\",\r\n# so as not to flood the user with way too much information about all the various\r\n# platform/arch combinations. Note that if the platform you're on is suddenly\r\n# discontinued, this would be a bit of an edge case where we should warn the\r\n# user somehow, maybe with an `exit 99` or something and a big warning in caps\r\n#\r\n\r\n$ rclone version --check -vv\r\n   yours:   1.4.1\r\n       platform: linux\r\n       arch: 386\r\n   latest:  1.4.3 (previous: 1.4.2, released 227 days ago)\r\n       platforms: linux \r\n       archs: [ \"i386\", \"x64\" ]\r\n   upgrade:\r\n       https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/tag/v1.43\r\n   download:\r\n       https://github.com/ncw/rclone/releases/download/v1.43/rclone-v1.43-linux-386.zip\r\n           checksums:\r\n             md5:  value\r\n             sha1: value\r\n   release metadata (JSON):\r\n       https://rclone.org/versions/latest.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm far from insistent on _anything_ here. I'm just throwing what's in my head at you in hopes that it'll spark some creativity in you and/or your team to carry this forward as you see fit.
