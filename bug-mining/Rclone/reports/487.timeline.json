It is likely that if clone had waited longer it would have worked. \r\n\r\nOn the retry we see\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018/02/06 08:44:48 DEBUG : traj.trr: Cancelling multipart upload: multipart upload failed to upload part: Put https://upload.box.com/api/2.0/files/upload_sessions/978436C11B373F25048523C8EA6E0C93: oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request\r\nResponse: {\"error\":\"invalid_grant\",\"error_description\":\"Refresh token has expired\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich I think must be the token expired but multiple threads refreshed it.  The box refresh token is only valid **once** though so the remaining threads got this error.  That is my guess as to what is going on.\r\n\r\nThis explanation doesn't quite add up as we don't see a `Saved new token in config file` DEBUG message so we didn't have a success.\r\n\r\nIn rclone.log.2.txt we see the same thing with rclone not waiting long enough.\r\n\r\nIn rclone.log.3.txt we see the token expiring and the refresh not working, again withouth a `Saved new token in config file` message\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018/02/06 12:06:45 ERROR : box root 'Jos/hamilton/MD-AB-surface/octacube/1.0/400K/0.85': Token refresh failed: couldn't list files: Get https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/45065466784/items?fields=type%2Cid%2Csequence_id%2Cetag%2Csha1%2Cname%2Csize%2Ccreated_at%2Cmodified_at%2Ccontent_created_at%2Ccontent_modified_at%2Citem_status&limit=1000&offset=0: oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request\r\nResponse: {\"error\":\"invalid_grant\",\"error_description\":\"Refresh token has expired\"}\r\n2018/02/06 12:06:48 DEBUG : combined.trr: Cancelling multipart upload: multipart upload failed to upload part: Put https://upload.box.com/api/2.0/files/upload_sessions/C1093086DA25A1101D0F81ABF4A1377C: oauth2: cannot fetch token: 400 Bad Request\r\n```\r\n\r\nrclone.log.4.beta.txt is the not waiting long enough problem...\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nSo, I think for big files transferred to box increasing `--low-level-retries` is necessary.  Can you try increasing it from 10 to 100 (say) and then send a log.  Hopefully it will succeed.  I can then use that to tune the time rclone waits for a file to be re-assembled.\r\n\r\n> I used to encounter the “range_overlaps_existing_part” error, but I didn't manage reproduce it today in debugging mode.\r\n\r\nIt might be that rclone needs to retry if that happens as it does if it gets a `parts_mismatch` error.  Interestingly that error isn't in the docs!\r\n\r\nIf you can send a log with that happening that would be very helpful

For large numbers of large files, you can use transfers=16, for small files (4kB), transfers above 12 results in throttling issues (probably because you're hammering many requests).\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018/05/10 19:57:37 DEBUG : Backup/RCBI/RCBI/auto-20180508.0300-4w/1525992712.591292: commit multipart upload failed 15/100 - trying again in 3 seconds (not ready yet)\r\n2018/05/10 19:57:38 INFO  : \r\nTransferred:    12 GBytes (19.481 MBytes/s)\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:                 0\r\nTransferred:            0\r\nElapsed time:    10m30.7s\r\nTransferring:\r\n *   .../auto-20180508.0300-4w/1525992712.591292: 100% /12G, 0/s, 0s\r\n\r\n2018/05/10 19:57:41 INFO  : Backup/RCBI/RCBI/auto-20180508.0300-4w/1525992712.591292: Copied (new)\r\n2018/05/10 19:57:42 INFO  : Backup/RCBI/RCBI/auto-20180508.0300-4w/1525992712.591292: Deleted\r\n2018/05/10 19:57:42 INFO  : \r\nTransferred:    12 GBytes (19.376 MBytes/s)\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:                 1\r\nTransferred:            1\r\nElapsed time:    10m34.1s\r\n\r\n2018/05/10 19:57:42 DEBUG : 6 go routines active\r\n2018/05/10 19:57:42 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.41\" finishing with parameters [\"rclone\" \"-vvvv\" \"--stats=30s\" \"--transfers=16\" \"--low-level-retries=100\" \"--exclude=tapedev\" \"--exclude=lastsnap\" \"--buffer-size=64M\" \"move\" \"/mnt/Backup/tapes\" \"URBox:/ZFS-SEND/\"]\r\nroot@zombie:/mnt/Backup/ZFS2rclone # \r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/388221210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"guruevi","id":1723625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1723625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi","html_url":"https://github.com/guruevi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guruevi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/402438640","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2054#issuecomment-402438640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2054","id":402438640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMjQzODY0MA==","user":{"login":"jmfrank63","id":3090462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63","html_url":"https://github.com/jmfrank63","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-04T10:31:55Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T10:31:55Z","body":"Hi Nick, my name is Johannes, I work for Box.

it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/403536201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/403811088","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2054#issuecomment-403811088","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2054","id":403811088,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzgxMTA4OA==","user":{"login":"jmfrank63","id":3090462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63","html_url":"https://github.com/jmfrank63","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-10T12:53:16Z","updated_at":"2018-07-10T12:53:16Z","body":"Hi Nick,\r\n\r\njust bumped in a file with little over 4GB that did not upload with 20 retries. To make sure it is 20 that is failing I added the parameter and set the value explicitly to 20, and it still failed. \r\nI tried to upload with 30 retries and it still failed, but it succeeded with 100. I did not take the time in seconds however. Do you know what a retry is worth in time?\r\nAdditionally I noticed the help text still identifies 10 as the default as well as rclone browser does (might not be your problem though).\r\n\r\nWith 100 I would like to do a little more investigation why this is taking so long and what the possible problem might be. As I work in User Services I would like to open a ticket on your behalf. May I use your support email address given for rclone?\r\nThanks Johannes","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/403811088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmfrank63","id":3090462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63","html_url":"https://github.com/jmfrank63","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmfrank63/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
