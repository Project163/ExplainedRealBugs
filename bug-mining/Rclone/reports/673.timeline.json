According to my tests the `full_control` scope is needed to issue the metadata PATCH command.\r\n\r\nSo going down from \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write\" to \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control\" has meant that we can't run PATCH on objects to set new metadata.\r\n\r\nI removed this in the oauth review because Google said\r\n\r\n> Thank you for submitting an OAuth App Verification request for the following Cloud scopes:\r\n>\r\n> - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control \r\n> - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform  \r\n>\r\n> Three-legged  OAuth2 scope grants are intended for human users to grant access to all  of their data hosted on a particular API.  Access to your requested  OAuth2 scopes would provide overly broad access for Google Cloud  Platform customers. Google Cloud Platform only supports grants to  specific resources for specific users/services, with access controlled  using Cloud IAM Policies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I failed to check updating the mod time.\r\n\r\nThere is a work-around for this - do the oauth again with v1.48 (use `rclone config` and edit the remote). The config file and generated token will work fine with v1.49.  However the oauth with v1.48 will give nasty errors.\r\n\r\nHere is the failing transaction\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019/08/28 10:15:58 DEBUG : HTTP REQUEST (req 0xc00013a400)\r\n2019/08/28 10:15:58 DEBUG :
