the forum we have a great help template which has the following categories\r\n\r\n1. What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n2. What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n3. Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n4.  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n5. The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)  \r\n6. The rclone config contents with secrets removed.  \r\n7. A log from the command with the `-vv` flag  \r\n\r\nOption 2 is covered by `rclone version`. Maybe we could get `rclone version` to deal with Option 3 also.\r\n\r\nHowever it was option 6 that the users could really do with help.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of a new command like `rclone config show` maybe `rclone config show --redacted` which could automatically redact sensitive information from the config file.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could combine `rclone version`, detecting which OS (might be too hard) and `rclone config show --redacted` into one super command which people can run and paste into the forum, maybe `rclone help me`\r\n\r\nThis could maybe even open up a forum post with these details already filled in if we can figure out how to do that.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nWhen running `rclone` with some configuration options set via environment variables, `rclone` will log sensitive values.  For example, if I run this command that runs `rclone` in docker, it will log my s3 access key id and secret key:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# docker run -it --rm \\\r\n  -e RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_REGION=\"us-east-2\" \\\r\n  -e RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\"<REDACTED>\" \\\r\n  -e RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"<REDACTED>\" \\\r\n  -e RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_TYPE=\"s3\" \\\r\n  -e RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_PROVIDER=\"aws\" \\\r\n  -e RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_ENV_AUTH=\"false\" \\\r\n  -e RCLONE_VERBOSE=2 \\\r\n  rclone-copy s3://rtr-data-models/stage/models/happy/v1.0/1652196245 /mnt/models\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.57.0\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"s3://rtr-data-models/stage/models/happy/v1.0/1652196245\" \"/mnt/models\"]\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"s3://rtr-data-models/stage/models/happy/v1.0/1652196245\"\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting type=\"s3\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_TYPE\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting provider=\"aws\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_PROVIDER\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting env_auth=\"false\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_ENV_AUTH\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting access_key_id=\"<REDACTED>\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting secret_access_key=\"<REDACTED>\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting region=\"us-east-2\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_REGION\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting region=\"us-east-2\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_REGION\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting region=\"us-east-2\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_REGION\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : s3: detected overridden config - adding \"{TrI48}\" suffix to name\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting provider=\"aws\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_PROVIDER\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting env_auth=\"false\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_ENV_AUTH\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting access_key_id=\"<REDACTED>\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting secret_access_key=\"<REDACTED>\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 DEBUG : Setting region=\"us-east-2\" for \"s3\" from environment variable RCLONE_CONFIG_S3_REGION\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:28 NOTICE: Config file \"/config/rclone/rclone.conf\" not found - using defaults\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"s3://rtr-data-models/stage/models/happy/v1.0/1652196245\" to be canonical \"s3{TrI48}:rtr-data-models/stage/models/happy/v1.0/165219624\r\n5\"\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/mnt/models\"\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 DEBUG : Local file system at /mnt/models: Waiting for checks to finish\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 DEBUG : Local file system at /mnt/models: Waiting for transfers to finish\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 DEBUG : 1/variables/variables.index: md5 = 7a60f2aa9a3abc2ef37a923f01e77a4c OK\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 INFO  : 1/variables/variables.index: Copied (new)\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 DEBUG : 1/saved_model.pb: md5 = a96abbefdc7d40a65ec48aed89723476 OK\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:29 INFO  : 1/saved_model.pb: Copied (new)\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:31 INFO  : 1/variables/variables.data-00000-of-00001: Copied (new)\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:31 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:       83.144 MiB / 83.144 MiB, 100%, 41.075 MiB/s, ETA 0s\r\nTransferred:            3 / 3, 100%\r\nElapsed time:         2.3s\r\n\r\n2022/08/04 13:38:31 DEBUG : 13 go routines active\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to run `rclone` with full verbose mode and not log sensitive values.  This PR is a step in that direction, it checks whether a given option we read from an environment value is marked `IsPassword`, and then sanitizes the output accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nIt isn't an issue yet in the rclone repo, but it originally came up in another repo as an issue:
