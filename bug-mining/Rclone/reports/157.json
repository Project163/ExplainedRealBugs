rclone v1.29\nOS: ubuntu 16.04\nCloud Storage: ACD\nCommand: rclone --log-file tmp.txt move src dst (same behavior with copy)\n\nWhen using the --log-file switch just about everything goes to the log file except the \"Starting bandwidth limiter at xxBytes/s\"  which goes to stdout regardless of the switch\n\nShould be a pretty easy fix to just switch that message output to log.printf from the current Log implementation in
