(e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nBackblaze\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p ~/mnt\r\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/test bs=1M count=300\r\nrclone -vv --config ~/.config/rclone/rclone-test.conf mount test:testbucketname ~/mnt > /tmp/rclone-mount.log 2>&1 &\r\nsleep 3\r\ncp /tmp/test ~/mnt/test\r\nsha256sum -b /tmp/test ~/mnt/test\r\nrclone --config ~/.config/rclone/rclone-test.conf deletefile test:testbucketname/test\r\numount ~/mnt\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith rclone 1.63.1 the SHA256 hash sums are equal, as expected. With rclone 1.64.0, however, they are different, and by looking at a hexdump it can be seen that 96 MiB chunks are shuffled in a wrong order.\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n[rclone-mount.log](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/files/12893689/rclone-mount.log)\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
