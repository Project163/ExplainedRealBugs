The use of spaces as separators in the `bwlimit` timetable syntax often leads to parsing problems within Docker configurations. This issue has been discussed on the rclone forum and various places on github, and I believe a simple yet effective change could significantly improve user experience in these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### The associated forum post URL\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/docker-volume-plugin-bwlimit-timetable/28219/4\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nrclone v1.65.1\r\n- os/version: arch (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.1.64-Unraid (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.21.6\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nThe problem is the conflict between rclone's `bwlimit` timetable syntax, which uses spaces as separators, and Docker's formatting. This leads to frequent parsing issues when configuring rclone within Docker environments.\r\n\r\n### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nI propose an enhancement to rclone's syntax to allow alternative characters, such as semicolons (`;`), as separators in the `bwlimit` timetable. This change would enable better compatibility with Docker and reduce the parsing issues currently experienced. The flexibility to use different separators would be a valuable addition for users working in various configurations and environments.\r\n\r\ninstead of just\r\n`--BWLIMIT=\"08:00,400k:off 23:00,off\"`\r\nalso allow:\r\n`--BWLIMIT=\"08:00,400k:off;23:00,off\"`\r\nwhich would eliminate the need for the double quote characters, thus making parsing that much more predictable\r\n`--BWLIMIT=08:00,400k:off;23:00,off`","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
