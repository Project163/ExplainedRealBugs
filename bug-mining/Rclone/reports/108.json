Also, if dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents go there.\n\nWhen I first used rclone, I used it like the Unix rsync command, where srcname (without trailing /) is sync'd to dest/srcname, not to dest/. So I did:\n\n```\nrclone sync somedir gcs:mybackup\n```\n\nInstead of sync'ing the somedir directory as a whole to create/sync mybackup/somedir, it sync'd somedir's contents to the mybackup level, wiping the whole previous contents of the bucket (80GB of data)  I didn't care because I was going to do that anyway, but it was a surprise!\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
