I would expect rclone to ignore the symlinks when they are stated in a filter. It looks like rclone first tries to resolve the links and only afterwards applies the filter. This is also stated by @ncw in the related forum post. I didn't find any related issue to the post by Tercio Filho therefore opening this one.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n1. Creating a broken symlink\r\n```\r\ntouch file1\r\ntouch file2\r\nln -s file1 link1\r\nln -s file2 link2\r\nrm file 1  # to break link1\r\n```\r\n2. Afterwards although specifically excluded by the filter the broken symlink still results in an Error\r\n```\r\n$ rclone ls -L . --exclude link1 -vv\r\n2022/08/11 10:07:11 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.53.3-DEV\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"ls\" \"-L\" \".\" \"--exclude\" \"link1\" \"-vv\"]\r\n2022/08/11 10:07:11 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \".\"\r\n2022/08/11 10:07:11 NOTICE: Config file \"/home/rothe/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\" not found - using defaults\r\n2022/08/11 10:07:11 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \".\" to be canonical \"/tmp/rclone\"\r\n2022/08/11 10:07:11 ERROR : link1: Listing error: symlink: stat /tmp/rclone/link1: no such file or directory\r\n        0 file2\r\n        0 link2\r\n2022/08/11 10:07:11 DEBUG : 2 go routines active\r\n2022/08/11 10:07:11 Failed to ls: symlink: stat /tmp/rclone/link1: no such file or directory\r\n```\r\nexit status is 6\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone version\r\nrclone v1.53.3-DEV\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.18.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nDebian 5.18.14-1 (2022-07-23) x86_64\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
