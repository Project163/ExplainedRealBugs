It can’t seem to export files larger that 5MB, might be 10MB (or some unspecific size; Google won’t say).\r\n\r\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36761333\r\n\r\nAnd this might be a better (or alternative) api call for copying from G Suite, if the file is too large. Maybe a \"alt_fallback\" switch in the command.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/FILE_ID/export/pptx\r\nThe downside is the file type has to be known.
