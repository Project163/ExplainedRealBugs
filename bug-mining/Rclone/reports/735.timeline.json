What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nAdd support for #3572 (public key auth with auth proxy)\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n#3572\r\n\r\nThis is a slight modification of the discussion on the ticket, I made it match the behavior of user/pass when the proxy is involved. Instead of spitting back public keys that are acceptable, the proxy returns a backend config and a zero if the public key is acceptable. I did it this way for two reasons #1 consistency of behavior and #2 I want to be able to log specifics of an auth request and while I definitely don't send user passwords on to logging, I see real value in having the successful or failed public key to help a user debug a connectivity issue.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any concerns or if I've goofed this up somehow, Thanks!\r\n\r\n####
