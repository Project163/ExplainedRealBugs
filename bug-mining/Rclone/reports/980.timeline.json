The documentation states you should choose 'external.'\r\n\r\nAttempted to start again from scratch. Internal was refused as an option because I don't have a GSuite subscription.\r\n\r\nSetting up external again, I am told \"While publishing status is set to 'Testing,' only test users are able to access the app.\"\r\n\r\nI am again presented with 403 when attempting to authorise rclone.\r\n\r\nAttempted to fix the problem by adding all available APIs to scope. Did not work, reverted.\r\n\r\n**Attempted to fix the problem by using the button \"Publish App\" which presents a dialogue reading thus:** \r\n\r\n> Push to production?\r\n> Your app will be available to any user with a Google Account.\r\n> You do not need to submit your app for verification. If you change your app's configuration in the future, like adding more than 10 domains, uploading a logo or requesting sensitive or restricted scopes, you will need to submit for verification.\r\n\r\n**SUCCESS!**\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be amended to include step to \"Publish App\" under the subtitle \"Publishing Status\" under the \"OAuth Consent Screen\" sidebar
