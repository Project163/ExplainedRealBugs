issue upstream https://github.com/jlaffaye/ftp/issues/342\r\n\r\nI added a comment there with the info above (thank you very helpful).\r\n\r\nI think what the error `TLS session of data connection not resumed` actually means is this...\r\n\r\nAs an extra security feature some FTP servers require that the data connection re-use the same TLS connection as the control connection. This is a good thing for security. However that message means that rclone failed to do that.\r\n\r\nGiven that this works when concurrency == 1 then what must be happening is that rclone or jlaffaye/ftp is mixing up the streams so we are attempting to do file transfers on the wrong TLS connection.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that we are re-using the session cache between connections so the TLS library has a chance of picking the wrong connection.\r\n\r\nTry this which uses a different session cache for each connection and should hopefully fix the problem.\r\n\r\n[v1.64.0-beta.7241.6efb5de13.fix-7234-ftp-tls](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-7234-ftp-tls/v1.64.0-beta.7241.6efb5de13.fix-7234-ftp-tls/) on branch
