This was an ongoing PR for weeks with \"this looks very good, but could you just adjust this part over there ... \" and then ... boom PR removed without any explanation.**\r\n\r\nThat is bad maintainer manners from @ncw -- and I would assume he has learned a lesson from it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/317131700/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bep","id":394382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/394382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep","html_url":"https://github.com/bep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1174671699,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE3NDY3MTY5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1174671699","actor":{"login":"hraban","id":137852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzg1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban","html_url":"https://github.com/hraban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-21T23:03:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1174671700,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNzQ2NzE3MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1174671700","actor":{"login":"hraban","id":137852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzg1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban","html_url":"https://github.com/hraban","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hraban/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-21T23:03:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1174671701,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE3NDY3MTcwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1174671701","actor":{"login":"leonwilliams","id":14914201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE0MjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14914201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams","html_url":"https://github.com/leonwilliams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonwilliams/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-21T23:03:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1174671702,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNzQ2NzE3MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1174671702","actor":{"login":"leonwilliams","id":14914201,"node_id":"MD
