Section 2.7.4.2. _Argument Descriptions_ says it should include `NumberReturned` and `TotalMatches`.\r\n\r\n[Current rclone code](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/3f3e4b055e322ed6b8c8686cc20948244d884c21/cmd/serve/dlna/cds.go#L291) only returns `Result`.\r\n\r\nThis was discovered using the [DLNA Digital Media Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dlna_dms) in Home Assistant.\r\n\r\nThis results in a failure to browse and inability to go further. Granted, the client could be more tolerant. But the fix seems trivial and would probably benefit everyone.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/assets/28158/cff1fe0a-4cca-4c45-be9c-2ded3442d5b3)\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.66.0\r\n- os/version: arch 24.0.1 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.7.12-1-MANJARO (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.22.1\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
