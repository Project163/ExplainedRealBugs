You can certainly help with testing things out!\n\nI'd like to fix the Google Drive problems as apart from those errors it works really well. The errors are caused by rclone doing too many requests per second as far as I can see.   Here is what my quota for rclone says, so that should allow 250 requests/second/user.\n\n```\nFREE QUOTA  10,000,000 requests/day\nREMAINING  9,933,268 requests/day 99.33% of total\nPER USER LIMIT  250 requests/second/user\n```\n\nI can try raising the number (I've already upped it from 100/s) or I could put some deliberate delays into rclone.  However I don't really think rclone is doing 250 requests per second.  It might be doing 25 in 100mS.\n\nI've just raised the quota to 1000 requests/s/user.  I don't know how long it takes to take effect, but it would be interesting if you have another go in a few hours.\n\nNext thing to try would be to pace the rclone requests so they always come more than 10 mS apart (say) which would be quite easy but require a bit of extra code.\n\nAs a workaround you can just run the rclone command again (and again) until it exits with no error - it will get there in the end - that is what I do! (I use Google Drive quite a lot.)\n\nAnother thing you could try is setting `--checkers 1` and `--transfers 1` - that might help.  Would be an interesting data point.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/71261455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/71261960","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/20#issuecomment-71261960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/20","id":71261960,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMjYxOTYw","user":{"login":"ChrisSLT","id":10635339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjM1MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10635339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSLT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-23T20:41:01Z","updated_at":"2015-01-23T20:41:01Z","body":"Hi

configure storage aliases in rclone for the same drive, right?\nIf it does not help then probably use multiple users (multiple Google Accounts) for the upload - this must run, unless the rate limit is on IP address network level, correct?\nOtherwise different users on different computers.\n\nIf we know where the limit really is, it should be possible to avoid it with multiple Access tokens / Refresh tokens / Users / Computers for uploading very large number of files faster...\n\nMaybe a command-line trick like starting rclone via xargs -n 25 on the list of files could make the workaround
