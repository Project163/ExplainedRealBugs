a strange issue with rclone VFS.\r\n\r\nVersion I am running: `v1.45-133-g291f2709-beta` (although this happened on stable as well)\r\n\r\nIt seems like the mount is not seeing a large chunk of my directories:\r\n\r\n> rclone mount 323 dirs\r\n> rclone vfs/refresh = 88 dirs\r\n> rclone vfs/forget = 323 dirs\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n\r\n> ls -lrth /mnt/remote/Media/TV |wc -l\r\n> 88\r\n>\r\n> rclone rc vfs/forget dir=Media/TV\r\n> {\r\n>     \"forgotten\": [\r\n>         \"Media/TV\"\r\n>     ]\r\n> }\r\n>\r\n> ls -lrth /mnt/remote/Media/TV |wc -l\r\n> 323\r\n> \r\n\r\nThis happens across any directory, here is another example:\r\n\r\n> ls -lrth /mnt/remote/Media/Movies/HD |wc -l\r\n> 435\r\n> \r\n> rclone rc vfs/forget dir=Media/Movies/HD\r\n> {\r\n> \t\"forgotten\": [\r\n> \t\t\"Media/Movies/HD\"\r\n> \t]\r\n> }\r\n> \r\n> ls -lrth /mnt/remote/Media/Movies/HD |wc -l\r\n> 628\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be appreciated","closed_by":{"login":"B4dM4n","id":448169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n","html_url":"https://github.com/B4dM4n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2946/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2946/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
