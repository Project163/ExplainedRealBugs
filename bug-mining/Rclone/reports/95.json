I've manage to make it work using an include-from filter. But then I keep getting a lot of noise about thumbs.db and .ds_store files and I'm trying to quiet that down. The -q flag doesn't seem to be doing anything about that, and using the exclude-from as posted below is also not causing those warnings/errors to go away.\n\n```\n~/rclone/rclone sync -q --include-from include-applications.txt --exclude-from exclude-applications.txt /Applications remote:#MAC/BACKUP/Applications\n```\n\nhere's my include-applications.txt (usually contains way more than one app but now only has one for testing)\n\n```\n4K Video Downloader.app/**\n```\n\nand here's my exclude-applications.txt\n\n```\nThumbs.db\n.DS_Store\n```\n\nand here's the console output\n\n```\n~/rclone  ./syncDropboxApplications.sh\n~/rclone/rclone sync -q --include-from include-applications.txt --exclude-from exclude-applications.txt /Applications remote:#MAC/BACKUP/Applications\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/.DS_Store: File name disallowed - not uploading\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/.DS_Store: Corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 6148 vs 0\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/5/.DS_Store: File name disallowed - not uploading\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/Versions/5/.DS_Store: Corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 6148 vs 0\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/.DS_Store: File name disallowed - not uploading\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/.DS_Store: Corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 6148 vs 0\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtNetwork.framework/.DS_Store: File name disallowed - not uploading\n2016/01/06 17:06:21 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtNetwork.framework/.DS_Store: Corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 6148 vs 0\n2016/01/06 17:06:22 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtNetwork.framework/Versions/.DS_Store: File name disallowed - not uploading\n2016/01/06 17:06:22 4K Video Downloader.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtNetwork.framework/Versions/.DS_Store: Corrupted on transfer: sizes differ 6148 vs 0\n2016/01/06 17:06:26\nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 5\nChecks:                76\nTransferred:            5\nElapsed time:      1m1.4s\n\n2016/01/06 17:10:37 Dropbox root '#MAC/BACKUP/Applications': Not deleting files as there were IO errors\n\nTransferred:            0 Bytes (   0.00 kByte/s)\nErrors:                 5\nChecks:               228\nTransferred:           15\nElapsed time:     5m12.1s\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
