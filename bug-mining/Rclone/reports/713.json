To be clear, I'm running rclone with the exact same config on a Windows machine, and rclone follows the Root Folder ID perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.50.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.4\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu 18.04.3 LTS \r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
