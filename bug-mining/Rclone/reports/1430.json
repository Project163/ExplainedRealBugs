We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.60.1\r\n- os/version: alpine 3.16.3 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.15.68.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.19.3\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nBackblaze B2 [server-side encryption](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/server_side_encryption.html) is currently available in rclone via the S3 API, but S3 uses MD5 which prevents the use of `--checksum` with SHA1 remotes (eg OneDrive personal).\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThe B2 Native API uses SHA1 and supports server-side encryption, so implementing it in rclone would allow the above combination of features.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add. It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\r\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"roucc","id":147946567,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNF8Rw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147946567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc","html_url":"https://github.com/roucc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
