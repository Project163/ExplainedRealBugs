I'm trying to pick up changes of the config file in order to always display the latest remotes using `config.FileSections()`. However after it cached the config it will use the cache, even if the underlying config file changes (by manually editing the file or using `rclone config`)\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to just call `LoadConfig()` before `FileSections()` but I noticed some other methods being called in `LoadConfig()` and I therefor was not sure if it's safe to call `LoadConfig()` multiple times. Is it safe to do so? And if not could you recommend an other way to ensure I always have the most up to date data from the config file?","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
