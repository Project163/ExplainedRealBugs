Examples use 1.52 as the current stable release.\r\n\r\n- 1.52.0 - first minor release\r\n- 1.52.1 - first patch release\r\n\r\nThat isn't controversial. Where I think we may be getting it wrong is the numbering of the betas...\r\n\r\nWe've always numbered the betas as previous stable version plus a bit, so 1.52.0-beta-NNN\r\n\r\nThis worked fine until we started making point releases which means that the beta numbering changes as we make a point release from 1.52.0-beta-XXX to 1.52.1-XXX which is strange and confuses users and complicates making a point release.\r\n\r\nReading the [semver spec](https://semver.org/) I think we should be calling the beta releases by the name of the release that they will become, so v1.53.0-beta-XXX rather than what it is currently called v1.52.3-beta-XXX\r\n\r\nIn particular [11.3](https://semver.org/#spec-item-11) says\r\n\r\n> When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version:\r\n> \r\n> Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0.\r\n\r\nSo this says that the 1.52.3-beta-XXX should be < 1.52.3 whereas it isn't at the moment.\r\n\r\nSo I think we should change so that the betas are called 1.53.0-beta-XXX\r\n\r\nThis makes the release sequence\r\n\r\n- 1.52.0\r\n- 1.53.0-beta-1\r\n- 1.53.0-beta-2\r\n- 1.52.1\r\n- 1.53.0-beta-3\r\n- 1.53.0-beta-4\r\n- 1.52.2\r\n- 1.53.0-beta-5\r\n- 1.53.0-beta-6\r\n- 1.53.0\r\n- 1.54.0-beta-1\r\n\r\n@rclone/rclone I'd love your opinion on this!","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
