Breaking down the detail of the hurdle, the two primary issues are: 1) Inputing the obscured password and 2) generating the oauth token.\r\n\r\nIn general, if we want to consider rclone (binary) to be usable in a hands off way, it needs to require a no input workflow. I saw that there are auto_config options in the internal functions, but the primary workflow (rclone config) definitely requires input (even to use the environmental variables) from what I understand.\r\n\r\nFor the Oauth portion: I think the path of least resistance would be to have a flag that would trigger the http server with the right id and name and await web input).\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\nrclone writeconfig --name NAME --TYPE ACD --OTHEROPT OTHERVALUE --auth http --httpPort 12345 --httpRedirect http://www.whatever.com --httpBind 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\nThis could write the initial config and then launch the http server that is there with the right variables (and maybe a timeout by default).\r\n\r\nI think all the parts are there, just needs a new workflow path.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/271691351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tcf909","id":1562915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjI5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1562915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909","html_url":"https://github.com/tcf909","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1839696293,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgzOTY5NjI5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1839696293","actor":{"login":"tcf909","id":1562915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjI5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1562915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909","html_url":"https://github.com/tcf909","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-11T21:50:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/453981148","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1010#issuecomment-453981148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1010","id":453981148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1Mzk4MTE0OA==","user":{"login":"tamama","id":17287685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjg3Njg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17287685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama","html_url":"https://github.com/tamama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tamama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-14T11:57:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T12:53:19Z","body":"As it is 2019 today, may I ask if there are any best practice for non-interactive config (or at least semi-interactive -
