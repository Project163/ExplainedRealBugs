are two options for adding regexp syntax to rclone filters.\r\n\r\n1. Find something which is currently illegal in the glob syntax and use that to mean regexp. Probably the most promising would be to wrap regexps in `{{}}` this would mean that then could be part of globs also. A Real glob supports nested `{}` though (which rclone's doesn't due to laziness on my part). Other alternatives would be to start a regexp with `]` or `}` or `***`\r\n2.

Then again we already have 144 global flags (not counting backend flags) so what is a few more! I'd probably be slightly more explicit on the flag names `--re-include`, `--re-include-from`, `--re-exclude`, `--re-exclude-from`, `--re-filter`, `--re-filter-from`. Let's call that option 3. You'd also have the problem that mixing `re` and non-`re` flags would do weird things in the same way that mixing `--include` and `--exclude` does now.\r\n\r\nI'm probably leaning towards the `{{regexp}}` option as it would be easy to implement (probably only half a dozen lines of code + some tests), could be mixed with the glob syntax so `*.{{[txt]{3}}}` and doesn't require a whole suite of new flags.\r\n\r\n> I don't use filters a lot but in my opinion, we should probably add the r-prefixed flags (rfilter, rinclude, rexclude) as mentioned by @asdffdsazqqq.
