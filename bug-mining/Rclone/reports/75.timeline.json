have same problem in my Buffalo NAS.\nI followed step by step in FAQ and I got error when tried to import ca-bundle.crt into ca-certificate.crt.\nThe workaround was using -k option in curl command and then copy paste to using nano create ca-certificate.crt. And it worked.\n\nThanks\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/184684139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bengki","id":17271499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17271499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki","html_url":"https://github.com/bengki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bengki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/184712547","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/196#issuecomment-184712547","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/196","id":184712547,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDcxMjU0Nw==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-16T14:52:25Z","updated_at":"2016-02-16T14:52:25Z","body":"@bengki I guess using `-k` aka `--insecure` makes sense if the platform doesn't have a ca-bundle.
