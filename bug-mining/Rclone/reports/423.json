Then I change the name on my local computer to `samefile`. Here's the output (slightly trimmed for conciseness):\r\n```\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:15 DEBUG : Using config file from \"/Users/username/.rclone.conf\"\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:15 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.39\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"-vv\" \"/Volumes/WD3TB/TV/Aerial America/\" \"gdrive:/TV/WD3TB/Aerial America/\" \"-vv\" \"--track-renames\" \"--size-only\" \"--transfers\" \"1\"]\r\n<snipped a few pacer rate limited errors>\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:20 INFO  : Google drive root 'TV/WD3TB/Aerial America': Modify window is 1s\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:20 INFO  : Google drive root 'TV/WD3TB/Aerial America': Making map for --track-renames\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:20 INFO  : Google drive root 'TV/WD3TB/Aerial America': Finished making map for --track-renames\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:20 INFO  : Google drive root 'TV/WD3TB/Aerial America': Waiting for checks to finish\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:20 INFO  : Google drive root 'TV/WD3TB/Aerial America': Waiting for renames to finish\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:22 INFO  : samefile: Copied (new)\r\n2018/01/23 20:03:31 DEBUG : America in Color - The 1920s.mp4: Sending chunk 0 length 8388608\r\n^C\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, rclone copied `samefile` over as if it were a new file. Then it begins sending over the next file (which also is already uploaded, just with a different name). \r\n\r\nCuriously, this also happens when a file is moved to another folder (which I thought was supposed to be covered as well by `--track-renames`). For example: Directory1/file is already on Google Drive. On my computer move file to Directory1/subdirectoryA/file and rclone begins a brand new upload (a duplicate copy). \r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Am I using `--track-renames` incorrectly? Thanks much\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
