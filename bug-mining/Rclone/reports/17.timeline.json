That is a pretty good assumption normally, and it saves lots of disk and network IO.\n\nrsync has a `-c` flag\n\n```\n    -c, --checksum              skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size\n```\n\nwhich checks checksums.  I should probably implement that for rclone at some point.\n\nWhen you run `rclone check` it does show the difference, but `rclone sync` refuses to update it because the mod-time and size are identical - is that what you are seeing?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/75631006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/75641327","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/32#issuecomment-75641327","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/32","id":75641327,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjQxMzI3","user":{"login":"ChrisSLT","id":10635339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjM1MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10635339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisSLT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisSLT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-23T21:43:05Z","updated_at":"2015-02-23T21:43:05Z","body":"Makes complete sense.
