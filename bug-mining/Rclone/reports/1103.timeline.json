Basically the server complains that credentials are invalid. \r\n\r\nWhat's more, I cannot login via old Mail.ru Cloud Windows software (with the same error text). It was syncing well, but after I logged out, I cannot log back in. Have not tried Disk-O as I don't have it.\r\n\r\nI hope that, like the original, the error is sporadic and will resolve by itself. Otherwise, it seems the server has changed (or stopped supporting \"cloud-win\" client_id) method of auth.\r\n \r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nv1.51.0\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nWin 10 x64\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
