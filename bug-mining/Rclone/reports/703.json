A log with -vv will make our day :-)\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Forum post:\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/some-bugs-with-drive-shared-with-me-flag/12401\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\n`--drive-shared-with-me` flag does not work as the way it should be when using without specifying any directory (Eg: `root`)\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.49.5\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.10\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nWindows 10, 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n**What exactly is happening:**\r\n\r\nWhen using the following command\r\n````\r\nrclone ls gdriveP: -vv --drive-shared-with-me --fast-list\r\n````\r\nRclone does not show the of \"Shared with me\" instead it shows the files of \"My Drive\". But if I specify a directory belongs to \"Shared with me\" then it works fine, eg:\r\n````\r\nrclone ls gdriveP:jordan -vv --drive-shared-with-me --fast-list\r\n````\r\n\r\n**Debug logs:**\r\n\r\n**When using without directory (1st command):**\r\n````\r\n2019/10/18 17:02:56 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.49.5\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"ls\" \"gdriveP:\" \"-vv\" \"--drive-shared-with-me\" \"--fast-list\" \"--log-file\" \"rclone.log\"]\r\n2019/10/18 17:02:56 DEBUG : Using config file from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\HARRY\\\\.config\\\\rclone\\\\rclone.conf\"\r\n2019/10/18 17:02:59 DEBUG : 9 go routines active\r\n2019/10/18 17:02:59 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.49.5\" finishing with parameters [\"rclone\" \"ls\" \"gdriveP:\" \"-vv\" \"--drive-shared-with-me\" \"--fast-list\" \"--log-file\" \"rclone.log\"]\r\n````\r\n\r\n**When using with directory (2nd command):**\r\n````\r\n2019/10/18 17:10:33 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.49.5\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"ls\" \"gdriveP:jordan\" \"-vv\" \"--drive-shared-with-me\" \"--fast-list\" \"--log-file\" \"rclone.log\"]\r\n2019/10/18 17:10:33 DEBUG : Using config file from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\HARRY\\\\.config\\\\rclone\\\\rclone.conf\"\r\n2019/10/18 17:10:36 DEBUG : 15 go routines active\r\n2019/10/18 17:10:36 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.49.5\" finishing with parameters [\"rclone\" \"ls\" \"gdriveP:jordan\" \"-vv\" \"--drive-shared-with-me\" \"--fast-list\" \"--log-file\" \"rclone.log\"]\r\n````\r\n\r\nAs you can there isn't much of a difference in the logs. The only difference I could see is 1st command has **9 go routines** active while the 2nd command  has **15 go routines** active.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** `--drive-shared-with-me` is ignored when using without specifying any directory. This affects **copy**, **sync**, other commands too.\r\n\r\nHowever there is some other things I need to mention. When using **lsd** command then everything works fine with/without directory..!! Eg:\r\n````\r\nrclone lsd gdriveP: --drive-shared-with-me --fast-list\r\n````\r\nIn the above command the directories of \"Shared with me\" shows without any issue. In case if you're interested in the log, here it is:\r\n\r\n````\r\n2019/10/18 17:18:31 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.49.5\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"lsd\" \"gdriveP:\" \"--drive-shared-with-me\" \"--fast-list\" \"--log-file\" \"rclone.log\" \"-vv\"]\r\n2019/10/18 17:18:31 DEBUG : Using config file from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\HARRY\\\\.config\\\\rclone\\\\rclone.conf\"\r\n2019/10/18 17:18:32 DEBUG : 5 go routines active\r\n2019/10/18 17:18:32 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.49.5\" finishing with parameters [\"rclone\" \"lsd\" \"gdriveP:\" \"--drive-shared-with-me\" \"--fast-list\" \"--log-file\" \"rclone.log\" \"-vv\"]\r\n````\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: The described bug does not seem to apply on `lsd` and `lsf` commands.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
