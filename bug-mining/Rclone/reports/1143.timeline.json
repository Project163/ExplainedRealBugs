https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/4865.\r\nFixes https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3666.\r\n\r\nFollow-up PR with parallel chunks upload: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/6179\r\n\r\n**Compared to the previous PR**:\r\n- Rebase changes on top of `master` & solve conflicts.\r\n- Fix uploading failures when the upload folder already exists. This happens when `rclone` is closed abruptly.\r\n- Fix chunks merge retries. NextCloud seems to sometimes need a bit of time before it's able to execute the `MOVE` operation without erroring out with `404`.\r\n- Rename `chunk_size` config to `nextcloud_chunk_size` and set it to NextCloud's default: `10 MiB`.\r\n- Set the chunked upload content type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` in order to follow the recommandations of NextCloud.\r\n\r\n**Known limitations**:\r\n- [x] Chunk uploads can't retry. See https://github.com/golang/go/pull/52603. If it doesn't get merged soon enough I'll do a workaround in this PR.\r\n  - **Update**: I implemented a workaround which uses `readers.NewRepeatableLimitReaderBuffer()`. This creates a buffer of chunk size, so it may use lots of memory if chunk size is set to a big value in the remote config. Maybe we could obtain a seekable reader from the upper-level abstraction instead of creating our own wrapper.\r\n- NextCloud keeps some weird locks on files which sometimes results in the error `423 Locked`. Need to figure out why this happens and if there is a workaround.\r\n  - WebDAV's [`UNLOCK` method](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918#section-9.11) may work to force the unlock (edit: it actually means that the file is still getting merged by NextCloud, nothing to do).\r\n- If an upload is aborted, it needs to be restarted from the beginning. Instead we could just retransfer the chunks that are missing/have an incorrect size.\r\n  - ⚠️ We would need to make sure to delete previously-uploaded chunks that are not in the current list of chunks. This is important if the chunk size was modified between invocations to avoid corrupting the file on merge with irrelevant chunks.\r\n\r\n**TODO**:\r\n- [ ] Add tests \r\n- [x] Don't purge long MOVE operations to work around server timeouts (`504 Gateway Time-out` then `423 Locked`).\r\n- [x] Fix crash https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/6133#issuecomment-1124579998 (see fix: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/6133/commits/5cf9b18c20550e1a9a49d3f00be87581af423873)\r\n  - Maybe see https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/1d6d41fb91e800fc10013b72cd601cb94976a316/backend/b2/b2.go#L1214-L1233 or https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/1d6d41fb91e800fc10013b72cd601cb94976a316/backend/box/upload.go#L232-L249 for inspiration. \r\n\r\n**In a follow-up PR:**\r\n- Upload chunks in parallel to boost the speed of sending big files with small chunks (#6179).\r\n- Automatically determine an appropriate chunk size using the max chunk size from the [server info API](https://github.com/nextcloud/serverinfo#api). Fallback to NextCloud's default 10 MiB limit if we fail to get it.\r\n\t```shell\r\n\tcurl https://[my_instance]/ocs/v2.php/apps/serverinfo_hetzner/api/v1/info?format=json |\r\n\tjq .ocs.data.server.php.upload_max_filesize\r\n\t\r\n\t> 10737418240\r\n\t```\r\n- Implement `fs.CleanUp()` to purge all the temporary upload folders.\r\n- When merging a transfer, if we receive 504 then start polling the MOVE operation regularly until it's not LOCKED anymore + output file exists (with a timeout). This workaround is required as NextCloud doesn't provide an API to check the progress of the chunks merging. Just returning a success doesn't work because rclone then checks the file, and restarts the transfer if it's not correct.\r\n- ~~[ ] Check the hash of the final merged file hash to make sure that the upload went well.~~\r\n  - NextCloud doesn't compute hashes yet so we can't do that. See https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/11138.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone!
