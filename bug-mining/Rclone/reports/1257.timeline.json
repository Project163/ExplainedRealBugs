What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis change officially adds bisync to the nightly integration tests for all backends.\r\n\r\nThis will be part of giving us the confidence to take bisync out of beta.\r\n\r\nA number of fixes have been added to account for features which can differ on different backends -- for example, hash types / modtime support, empty directories, unicode normalization, and unimportant differences in log output. We will likely find that more of these are needed once we start running these with the full set of remotes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, bisync's extremely sensitive tests revealed a few bugs in other backends that weren't previously covered by other tests. Fixes for those issues have been submitted on the following separate PRs (and bisync test failures will be expected until they are merged):\r\n\r\n- #7670\r\n- #7688\r\n- #7690\r\n- #7692\r\n\r\nRelatedly, workarounds have been put in place for the following backend limitations that are unsolvable for the time being:\r\n\r\n- #3262 (drive is sometimes aware of trashed files/folders when it shouldn't be)\r\n- #6199 (dropbox can't handle emojis and certain other characters)\r\n- #4590 (onedrive API has longstanding bug for `conflictBehavior=replace` in server-side copy/move)\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n- #7665 \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nSeveral fixes for the `bisync` integration tests:\r\n\r\n- use unique `initdir` and `datadir` for each subtest so concurrent tests don't interfere with each other\r\n- remove dots from dir names for bucket backends\r\n- ignore messages specific to `cache` backend\r\n- skip fix-case tests on backends that can't fix-case\r\n- don't expect `{hashtype} differ` messages on backends with no hash types\r\n- print timestamps in UTC local\r\n\r\nMore fixes will still be needed, but this should hopefully fix a good portion of them.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7665\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution
