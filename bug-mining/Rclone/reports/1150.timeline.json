What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nExtend linting in build pipeline to include checks from the Staticcheck tool, see https://staticcheck.io.\r\n\r\n##### About staticcheck and golangci-lint\r\n\r\nThe [Staticcheck](<https://staticcheck.io>) tool is the default golang linter in Visual Studio Code dev environment with the Go extension, and from my experience it gives many relevant suggestions that the existing linting performed by our build pipeline does not report. The existing ci linting in rclone is based on [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run), which supports running many different linters - and staticcheck is one of them. This means we can enable staticcheck in the existing golangci-lint configuration, instead of running it as a separate build step or something. This will probably be much easier to implement, and no additional build steps/scripts/configuration files etc.\r\n\r\nBut, the staticcheck feature of golangci-lint is not the same as the original/stand-alone staticcheck:\r\n\r\n> It's a set of rules from staticcheck. It's not the same thing as the staticcheck binary. The author of staticcheck doesn't support or approve the use of staticcheck as a library inside golangci-lint.\r\n\r\nStaticcheck is in fact a binary that somewhat similar to golangci-lint incorporates a set of different linter libraries used to perform the actual checks. The full overview of checks it performs is here: https://staticcheck.io/docs/checks. The linter that golangci-lint calls \"staticcheck\" is only a subset of these, but the rest are also available as separate configurable [golangci-lint linters](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/linters/);\r\n- Checks with [SA-prefix](https://staticcheck.io/docs/checks#SA) are labelled `staticcheck`, supported in golangci-lint as linter \"staticcheck\".\r\n- Checks with [ST-prefix](https://staticcheck.io/docs/checks#ST) are labelled `stylecheck`, supported in golangci-lint as linter \"stylecheck\".\r\n    - Note that some of these are disabled by default in staticcheck binary, enabling \"stylecheck\" in golangci-lint will by default enable all so to match staticcheck one must configure the [checks option](https://staticcheck.io/docs/configuration/options/#checks).\r\n    - One that is enabled is the following, which is very relevant to have in rclone: `ST1005: error strings should not be capitalized`.\r\n- Checks with [S-prefix](https://staticcheck.io/docs/checks#S) are labelled `simple`, supported in golangci-lint as linter \"gosimple\".\r\n- Check U1000 is implemented in `unused`, supported in golangci-lint as linter \"unused\".\r\n   - It is not documented in the staticcheck site, but in golangci-lint docs it is described as reporting unused constants, variables, functions and types.\r\n\r\nI have enabled the first three: `staticcheck`, `gosimple` and `stylecheck`. Configured `stylecheck` to only consider the same limited set of checks as the staticcheck tool does, as mentioned above. Did not enable `unused`, because there are currently some 15 occurrences of internal functions that are never called in the rclone codebase.\r\n\r\n##### Excludes\r\n\r\nSince staticcheck reports many issues not reported by the existing set of linters we are running, we need to:\r\n1. Fix as many of the reported issues as we can.\r\n2. Add excludes for any false positives, or issues that we otherwise don't want to fix, or don't want reported.\r\n\r\nRegarding 1:\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6273 contains information of work done, with links to individual issues fixing specific staticcheck-reported problems. This PR also includes a couple of additional minor fixes.\r\n\r\nRegarding 2:\r\n\r\nThere will typically always be some issues that must be ignored, i.e. actual false positives. One example is code passing a `nil` context, which staticcheck reports should instead be `context.TODO`, but when this is in a unit test specifically testing `nil` contexts we obviously can't do that. Such issues must be permanently excluded from the lint results.\r\n\r\nOther issues may be relevant to fix, but not important enough to \"red flag\" a PR, for example, they may be \"known issues\" that are not easy to fix but should not be completely forgotten either, or it may not be obvious if they are false positives or not and we need developers/time to find out. These issues could be relevant to show in the lint result, but as information, or warning, not as a regular lint error (though some may argue that, like with unit tests, either it should be an error or not and not build up a backlog of \"unknowns\"). If staticcheck proves to be too \"noisy\", we could also consider the possibility to make it purely advisory. Golang-ci does actually support [configuring severity](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/configuration/#severity-configuration), but unfortunately it does not affect the exit code - i.e. as long as there are any issues found, regardless if none are reported as errors, but only warning or notice, the golangci-lint execution will still fail with \"Error: issues found\". There are several issues/PRs at [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) discussing this, but for now it seems we either have to ignore issues entirely or let them fail (and fix them asap).\r\n\r\nTo ignore issues there are two main strategies:\r\n- Configure excludes in `.golangci.yml`.\r\n   - In [linter-specific settings](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/linters/#staticcheck) configuring specific staticcheck [checks](https://staticcheck.io/docs/configuration/options/#checks), or in issue settings [exclude/exclude-rules](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/configuration/#issues-configuration).\r\n   - There are many possible ways to achieve similar things, where one can choose to consider path, text (issue message), source code, regex-matching, specific linters, etc.\r\n- Write special ignore comments in the source code.\r\n   - Note that golangci-lint does not (currently) consider the same format as the original staticcheck (as discussed in several [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) issues):\r\n      - Stand-alone staticcheck supports ignoring specific checks using format `//lint:ignore SA1012 explain reason here` ([ref](https://staticcheck.io/docs/configuration/#ignoring-problems)).\r\n      - Golangci-lint staticcheck does not support the above, but can disable all checks from staticcheck for a given line using format `//nolint:staticcheck // Explain reason here` ([ref](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/false-positives/#nolint-directive)). Note that this disables all staticcheck issues on the line, while the lint:ignore format supported by staticcheck itself allows ignoring specific lint checks.\r\n   - To support both tools, i.e. both golangci-lint linting on GitHub and staticcheck linting done in dev environment from VSCode etc, both must be specified. Note that my experience is that they must be on separate lines, in a comment section before the line containing the issue to be ignored, i.e. cannot be combined at the end of the code line despite I've seen examples of this claiming to work. Working example:\r\n      ```\r\n      //lint:ignore SA1012 false positive when running staticcheck, we want to test passing a nil Context and therefore ignore lint suggestion to use context.TODO\r\n      //nolint:staticcheck // Don't include staticcheck when running golangci-lint to avoid SA1012\r\n      config := GetConfig(nil)\r\n      assert.Equal(t, globalConfig, config)\r\n      ```\r\n- See golangci-lint/issues/741 for more info and other alternatives.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- Look into reported issues that are not obvious - fix code, or exclude - but only if we can conclude it is really a false positive.\r\n   - This mainly boils down to the following:\r\n      - argument should be pointer-like to avoid allocations (SA6002)\r\n   https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/58b327a9f6382f1c104c7ed8e1355ad14806d20d/backend/crypt/cipher.go#L242\r\n      - infinite recursive call (SA5007)\r\n   https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/58b327a9f6382f1c104c7ed8e1355ad14806d20d/fs/pacer.go#L76\r\n      - argument err is overwritten before first use (SA4009), backend/onedrive/onedrive.go:1671:3: assignment to err\r\n   https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/58b327a9f6382f1c104c7ed8e1355ad14806d20d/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L1670\r\n   - 🆘 I really need help on this one.\r\n- So, how do we choose to define excludes?\r\n   - Some arguments I can think of:\r\n      - Do we want to maintain excludes spread around the source code, or do we want to bloat the .golangci.yml with exclude rules?\r\n      - In comment it pinpoints the exact line, while a .golangci.yml exclude-rule is more or less global, or at least one entire file.\r\n      - In comment it must be repeated for each occurrence, though a special comment can be added at top of a file to cover the entire file.\r\n      - In comment it is easier to lose overview of what we have actually excluded, but (see next point)...\r\n      - With comment-based excludes, staticcheck has dedicated checks for unnecessary excludes and will report them as errors, so it is easy to maintain them and keep them relevant! - But not sure if the golangci-lint variant supports the same?\r\n      - Exclude-rules in .golangci.yml only affects golangci-lint, so separate runs with staticcheck, such as from VSCode, will not consider these.. Which may be seen as positive or negative... Negative if the excludes are false positives, which will just be noise in VSCode etc. Positive if not definitively classified as false positives, because in a VSCode dev env you get the complete list of possible problems and can look into them. \r\n   - For \"temporary\" excludes, e.g. some of the ones reported when I now first enable these checks which I can't figure out myself, I leaning towards adding them as excludes in the .golangci.yml. This makes them more visible, we have the full overview in the yml file, they will all still be reported in VSCode dev env, i.e. more likely to be picked up and actually considered and not just forgotten.\r\n   - For \"permanent\" excludes, i.e. reported issues that have been investigated and found to be false positives, I think exclude by code comments is good.
