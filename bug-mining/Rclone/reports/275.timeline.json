\r\nAbout the cpu, as far as I know the RT-N56U has mediatek MIPS 1004Kc or 74Kc depending on revision, mine's is V1. In the case of this asus the official datasheet [ shows a FPU on second page](http://www.bdti.com/MyBDTI/pubs/74k.pdf) \r\n\r\nThe xiaomi router , has mediatek with MT7620A that seems to be 24KEc that doesn't have HW FPU , but it runs too, so the only possibilities that I'm thinking now:\r\n\r\na)-Master of go compiler supports FPU emulation or is supported by some hack-kernel emulator.\r\n\r\nb)-The gdrive code and its dependencies doesn't do any FPU compute, that is mostly improbable because it uses https, graph algorithms,and other dependencies that for sure there are floats... \r\n\r\nc)-The binary runs, lists files and help, but since I have no tested the connecting part because I have to integrate the root certificates on tomato, the code part that uses FPU was still not invoked. This is because I have to fix the requirements for https connection (root certificates). Anyway I can test on openwrt first that is easier to integrate the root certificates.\r\n\r\nAnyway if you want and you have root certificates installed, you can test my binaries for gdrive (sorry for
