going to write this up in a new FAQ entry, something like this\n\n### Why doesn't rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync?\n\nRclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote\ncloud storage system.  This means that you can see the files you\nupload as expected using alternative access methods (eg using the\nGoogle Drive web interface).  There is a 1:1 mapping between files on\nyour hard disk and objects created in the cloud storage system.\n\nCloud storage systems (at least none I've come across yet) don't\nsupport partially uploading an object. You can't take an existing\nobject, and change some bytes in the middle of it.\n\nIt would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs\ninstead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the\n1:1 mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud\nstorage system.\n\nAll the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so\nit would be possible to make partial downloads work.  However to make\nthis work efficiently this would require storing a significant amount\nof metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of files to objects.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/136347700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":406352772,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDA2MzUyNzcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/406352772","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"cbc6bf6a89d1941accd1a470f5c739e88f96e2c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/cbc6bf6a89d1941accd1a470f5c739e88f96e2c4","created_at":"2015-09-10T19:27:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/140312586","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/113#issuecomment-140312586","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/113","id":140312586,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDMxMjU4Ng==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-15T07:55:22Z","updated_at":"2015-09-15T07:55:22Z","body":"@mrschyte Thanks for the report -
