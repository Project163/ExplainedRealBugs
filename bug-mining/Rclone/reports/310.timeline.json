interested in using this feature as currently the output of ls is a bit difficult to parse into a mysql db because there seems to be no way to specify the desired formatting from ls so it just seperates by space, but weirdly the first field which is the filesize in bites is center aligned when piping out to a text file?\r\n\r\nis there a work-in-progress version of this json output? Or is there any other way to tell the rclone ls command what type of formatting is desired? EG comma separated at the least?\r\n\r\nWould be great to be able to output the dates and mime type as well!\r\n\r\nLooking forward to using this as it would help with using a better advanced search
