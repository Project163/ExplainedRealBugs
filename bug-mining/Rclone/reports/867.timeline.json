I would have thought when you delete the file on the remote, the change notify should tell rclone and it will remove the file from the directory entry.\r\n\r\nHowever If I use `--poll-interval 0` to turn off change notify I can replicate this problem.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening is that a virtual directory entry gets made when you upload the file. The virtual entries normally get removed if you read the directory and the file is missing.\r\n\r\nHowever if you don't read the directory and delete the remote file the virtual directory entry will remain indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI have a potential fix for this but it doesn't work yet :-(\r\n\r\n(sorry forgot to press

It will be stuck in your mount well past the default polling and dir-cache times (possibly forever). However if it's been a while (10+ mins in my testing) since you last accessed/cached the file on the VFS mount and then you delete it externally, it will almost immediately be removed from your mount
