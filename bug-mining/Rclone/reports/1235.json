What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nWhen calling bisync with a remote, but a leading `/` in the remote path like so\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrclone bisync remote:/path/with/unneeded/slash /some/local/path --resync\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe path will be normalized by Rclone and the command will be executed without throwing any error (or warning).\r\n\r\nIf you then try to run `bisync` without `--resync` however, it will not behave as expected. Running the exact same command without `--resync` will always yield:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nERROR : Bisync critical error: cannot find prior Path1 or Path2 listings, likely due to critical error on prior run\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis suggests that `bisync` failed previously, when in fact it didn't. It seems to name the listings after the normalized path, while checking for existing listings with the non-normalized path, as provided by the user.\r\n\r\nThis seems likely, because running the command again, but without the leading slash and `--resync`, will work:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrclone bisync remote:path/with/unneeded/slash /some/local/path\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.64.2\r\n- os/version: arch Soaring (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.6.1-zen1-1-zen (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.21.3\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nArch Linux, 64 bit\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\nProton Drive\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
