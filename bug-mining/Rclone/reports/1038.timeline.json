is for discussion. This is causing a real problem in rclone https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5806 but there may be a better way of fixing.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBefore this change, ReadFromWithConcurrency would very often submit writes to the server out of order due to small timing differences when lots of blocks were queued and ready to send.\r\n\r\nThis causes more work for the server as seeking about the file isn't free. Writing chunks of a file out of order can also cause fragmentation and consequently loss of performance on that file.\r\n\r\nThis patch causes the write to the channel to be handled synchronously but the acks are received asynchronously allowing for many write packets to be in flight as
