There is no time so rclone returning the current time is the correct thing to do.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the 404 status is doing there, maybe it means that the date isn't available. Either way the object does exist doesn't it?\r\n\r\nThis could potentially cause excess syncing. This is easy to work around with the --size-only flag though.\r\n\r\nHowever your workaround is a soft fail which means that things will carry on copying which is good user experience.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should warn the user once that the remote isn't returning modtimes. I probably wouldn't bother though as there are many other places in the rclone backends which do exactly the same thing. Maybe a debug would be a good idea.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/411500672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/411526584","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2420#issuecomment-411526584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2420","id":411526584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTUyNjU4NA==","user":{"login":"buergi","id":1948339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDgzMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1948339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi","html_url":"https://github.com/buergi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buergi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-08T19:37:35Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T19:37:35Z","body":"The question is shall files with missing modtimes be skipped or forcefully copied (which is what setting modtime to now actually means, does it?).
