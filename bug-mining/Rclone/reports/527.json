We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.43.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nI am unable to copy files from a WebDAV server which is returning 302 response followed by a Location header. The WebDAV server (Apache-Coyote/1.1) has RFC4437 enabled which describes the WebDAV behavior. In my example, the location is an AWS S3 bucket (not another location on the WebDAV server).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nWhen the endpoint returns 302 Found, rclone cannot actually \"retrieve\" the file without following the 302 to the new location. \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2635/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
