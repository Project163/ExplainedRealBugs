I am reposting this issue/bug report from rclone forum here where i hope it can get some love.\r\nHi! I'm new but since 1.51 i can not use Elgiganten cloud, they used same login as jottacloud and their storage servers, just rebranded i guess.\r\nFrom 1.52 notes: \"removed remains from old auth\" Is there a chance to get this back?\r\nAs Elgiganten Cloud still use the old Jottacloud login and that still works for me with 1.50.2. but 1.51 and later breaks that so i can't use with Elgiganten Cloud anymore.\r\nMaybe reintroduce old jotta login/setup and add new remote option for Elgiganten Cloud?\r\nI think eventually elgiganten cloud will change their login to the one Jotta currently uses, but i am unsure of that.\r\nHeres the client from windows store, basically jotta with old login: https://i.imgur.com/XbTaH3b.png\r\nI would love to be able to keep rclone updated past 1.50.2 and still having this remote continuing to work :)\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n1.51 and newer versions of rclone no longer work with jottacloud \"rebrands\" like Elgiganten Cloud/Com Hem Cloud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nCurrent version in use is 1.50.2 that still works with Elgiganten Cloud\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nWindows 10, 64-bit\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nElgiganten Cloud (jottacloud)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nA remote can not be set up due to Elgiganten cloud still using the old Jottacloud rclone remote setup that was removed/updated since version 1.51\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"buengese","id":4004974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDQ5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4004974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese","html_url":"https://github.com/buengese","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
