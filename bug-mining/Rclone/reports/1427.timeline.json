week ago, i made an issue about cromite's abp-filters-anti-cv filter list https://gitlab.com/eyeo/anti-cv/abp-filters-anti-cv/-/issues/260 the devs fixed it almost immediately, yet a week later the version of this filter list that cromite hosts https://www.cromite.org/filters/abp-filters-anti-cv.txt has STILL not been updated. The ui breakage that the eyeo devs fixed A WEEK AGO has STILL not reached cromite, it's been like 9 days! Cromite's filter says Last Modified October 7.\nThis isn't the only filter list having this issue tho. I also made multiple issues about the Badblock Lite filter list and the dev fixed them quite fast. And yet, cromite's versions have not received the update either. So those sites are still broken for me when using Cromite. Why are cromite's lists not being updated? It's even more frustrating since only the cromite-hosted abp-filters-anti-cv is allowed to inject javascript snippets. If i want to directly import the original url of the filter list, it won't have this snippet functionality and it will be useless.\n\nIn fact, none of cromite's filterlists have been updated since October 7th, not even easylist. If they will only update once every 10 days or whatever it negates all the benefit of being hosted on cromite.org\n\nI have now resorted to manually adding the lists to get proper updates\n\n<img

abp-filters-anti-cv list since it requires snippet functionality to work","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uazo/cromite/issues/2411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/uazo/cromite/issues/2411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20377613164,"node_id":"AE_lADOAQ-n5M7QyIaNzwAAAAS-mbNs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/20377613164","actor":{"login":"roucc","id":147946567,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNF8Rw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147946567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc","html_url":"https://github.com/roucc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-20T10:58:13Z","assignee":{"login":"roucc","id":147946567,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNF8Rw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147946567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc","html_url":"https://github.com/roucc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20457530232,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M7QyIaNzwAAAATDXSN4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/20457530232","actor":{"login":"roucc","id":147946567,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNF8Rw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147946567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc","html_url":"https://github.com/roucc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"188a061090d02387340d218bf3252ca994e6524c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/188a061090d02387340d218bf3252ca994e6524c","created_at":"2025-10-23T15:26:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3437663034","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8892#issuecomment-3437663034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8892","id":3437663034,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M7M5pM6","user":{"login":"roucc","id":147946567,"node_id":"U_kgDOCNF8Rw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147946567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc","html_url":"https://github.com/roucc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roucc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-23T15:30:35Z","updated_at":"2025-10-23T15:30:35Z","body":"Hi
