What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n1.35\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nPreventing clone/sync of duplicate files, for which only the casing differs, regardless if the source/target file-systems having cases sensitive filesystems (e.g. most/all linux systems)\r\n\r\ne.g. files “Application A.doc” and “application a.doc” are now treated as two different files, I hope to be able to set a flag so they are treated as one and the same.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAdd a flag that can either be combined or superseded with/by \"--ignore-existing\" so a file will NOT be copied/synced when the existing filename is the same, even if the casing is different \r\n(e.g. --ignore-existing-case-insensitive)\r\n\r\nForum link:
