What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.53.1\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nCopy the contents of the shortcut when server side copying (google drive)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAdding a flag to change this default action of copy to copy the contents of the shortcut.\r\nAnd for the circular things, maybe we can combine such flag with a number to limit the tracking depth of shortcuts or the default depth of 1?\r\nSee more
