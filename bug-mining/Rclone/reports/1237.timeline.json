Intro\r\n\r\nThe bisync pull request #5164 appeared too large to fulfil in a single rclone release.\r\n\r\nPlan is to merge it right after the rclone v1.57 release. The command will be available in the beta builds for a limited circle of beta testers until official release with rclone v1.58.\r\nDuring the beta period we can merge a number of postponed items, **in particular breaking changes**.\r\n\r\nThis ticket will keep track of the most beta time changes. Large and critical changes will be split into separate tickets.\nHigh priority items reflect changes breaking user experience and must be completed before 1.58. Medium priority items are required but not guaranteed by 1.58. Optional and low priority items will be implemented on best effort basis. Optional items don't even have dedicated tickets yet.\r\n\r\n### High priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Track critical flags in saved sessions - #5678\r\n- [ ] Support imprecise or absent modtimes - #5679\r\n- [ ] Use hashsums, honor `--checksum` - #5683\r\n\r\n### Medium priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check file sizes - #5684\r\n- [ ] Respect `--backup-dir` - #5685\r\n- [ ] Align `--max-delete` semantics - #5680\r\n- [ ] Optimize resync - #5681\r\n- [ ] Track renames - #5690\r\n\r\n### Low priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Handle deletion conflicts - #5691\r\n- [ ] Honor `--interactive` and `--auto-confirm`\r\n- [ ] Recover after transient failures - #5676\r\n- [ ] Use **trie** for listings to reduce footprint - #5686\r\n- [ ] Maintain session history - #5692\r\n- [ ] Handle Google Docs better - #5696\r\n\r\n### Optional items\r\n\r\n- [ ] Parallelize move/rename operations\r\n- [ ] Honor special `.rcignore` files\r\n- [ ] Revisit progress display for bisync\r\n- [ ] Handle case-insensitive filenames.

to this ticket (and also #5676), `--check-sync` should also support comparing `modtime` (and eventually, when [`checksum`](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5683) and [`size`](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5684) are supported, it should use the same sync key used for the bisync run.)\r\n\r\nCurrently, `--check-sync` only compares filenames, not `modtime`, `size`, or `hash`. It can detect whether a file from one Path is missing on the other, but not whether both Paths have different versions of a file. This can cause issues such as [this one](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-missed-syncing-changed-file-no-error-no-warning/41174/2).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, perhaps this would be better handled by outsourcing it to the more robust [`rclone check`](https://tip.rclone.org/bisync/#concurrent-modifications), rather than attempting to duplicate the same functionality in `--check-sync`.\r\n\r\nHere's

sometimes normalizes NFD to NFC and sometimes does not, causing errors in some scenarios (particularly for users of macOS). See https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-question/41434/12\r\n\r\nHere is a bare-minimum case to reproduce:\r\n```\r\n% rclone touch NFD/ö \r\n% rclone touch NFC/ö\r\n% rclone bisync NFD NFC --resync\r\n2023/09/02 18:23:08 NOTICE: bisync is EXPERIMENTAL.

Don't use in production!\r\n2023/09/02 18:23:17 ERROR : -          Path1 file not found in Path2       - ö\r\n2023/09/02 18:23:17 ERROR : -          Path2 file not found in Path1       - ö\r\n2023/09/02 18:23:17 ERROR : Bisync critical error: path1 and path2 are out of sync, run --resync to recover\r\n2023/09/02 18:23:17 ERROR : Bisync aborted. Must run --resync to recover.\r\n% \r\n```\r\n\r\nAs background context: most of the world uses NFC, but macOS prefers NFD for some reason, and will sometimes ([but not always](https://eclecticlight.co/2017/04/06/apfs-is-currently-unusable-with-most-non-english-languages/)) convert NFC filenames to NFD invisibly. (See also: #7072)\r\n\r\nRclone's `copy` and `sync` commands (including the ones used by `bisync` under-the-hood) automatically normalize to NFC, unless `--no-unicode-normalization` is specified. This is why you can usually `rclone sync` between mac and non-mac without issue -- rclone will recognize the NFC and NFD versions as the same filename.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that there are three places where bisync does NOT do this:\r\n\r\n1. When building the list of files that need to be transferred during `--resync`\r\n2. When building the list of deltas during a non-resync, but only for so-called [\"Unusual sync checks\"](https://tip.rclone.org/bisync/#unusual-sync-checks)\r\n3. When comparing Path1 to Path2 during `--check-sync`\r\n\r\n1 and 2 end up being (mostly) harmless, because although it will try to copy the NFC and NFD versions as different files, the underlying `copy` function it calls is smart enough to realize they are the same file. It will therefore leave the files alone (if already equal) or update one of them (if not equal), but never create a duplicate.\r\n\r\n3 is where the problem is most visible. Because `--check-sync` never normalizes, it thinks the NFC and NFD versions are different files. It therefore thinks something went wrong during the bisync run, because at the end of the run the Path1 file list does not exactly match Path2. Accordingly, it throws a critical error. (`--check-sync` is true by default, but can be overridden with `--check-sync=false`.)\r\n\r\nThe long-term solution is probably that `bisync` should support normalization in the same manner as `sync` (i.e. always normalize when comparing between paths, unless `--no-unicode-normalization` has been specified.) In the mean time, as a short-term solution, the issue can be bypassed by using `--check-sync=false`.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting: in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5679#issuecomment-1689295692 we are contemplating whether `--check-sync` should perhaps just be replaced by outsourcing it to the more robust [rclone check](https://tip.rclone.org/bisync/#concurrent-modifications), which duplicates a lot of the same functionality, but does it better. That may ultimately be the answer here too, at least for item 3 (`--check-sync`). But I think items 1 and 2 do still need to be addressed regardless, as they are (at best) misleading to users (for instance, dry runs indicate that files will be transferred when they are not in fact new/changed and won't really be transferred.)\r\n\r\nOne more note: it seems that macOS will accept NFC filenames when created via terminal commands, but not when created via apps or Finder. This is why we don't tend to see these issues at first with files synced from cloud to mac via rclone, but the same files could present issues later if edited by an app or Finder. (This is also why `rclone touch NFC/ö` in the above repro will work, even on mac.)\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

this is likely when resync is run when data is already present vs copying the data itself.. There are no changes made to files when moving between a --resync and normal run.  \r\n\r\ndefaults:\r\n\tresync: 10m47.0s\r\n\tnormal: 6m44.7s\r\n\r\ndefaults with ignore checksum: (--ignore-listing-checksum --ignore-checksum)\r\n\tresync: 10m36.5s\r\n\tnormal: 6m31.9s\r\n\r\n### overview\r\n\r\nSo as you can see bisync is orders of magnitude slower than `copy` or `sync` . `ls` is incredibly fast as is `sync` and `copy` in both directions (e.g. uses up almost 100% of bandwidth)\r\n\r\nI only ran the test of `lsl` and `ls` at the very end and now thinking that bisync relies on lsl as this so incredibly slow (as I believe bisync does not use checksum so would need `lsl` info to compare?).\r\n\r\nI can do a local to crypt (local) bisync in 15s (--resync) and 8.7s for subsequent. \r\n\r\nIs there something I am doing wrong? If not, are there plans/options available to rclone to improve the speed of bisync so that it is more in line with 2 x sync/copy commands (e.g. one upload, one download) or is this a limitation that is unlikely to be overcome? Also, if this is due to lsl taking so long is there a way to speed up lsl? \r\n\r\nThanks to you all for your hard work and a special thank you @nielash for all you've been doing on bisync and continue to do. I as many others massively appreciate it and when this tool is out of experimental stages it will be a game changer for so many. If I had any free time or money right now I would help out but unfortunately the best I can do is give you some benchmarks and user feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks
