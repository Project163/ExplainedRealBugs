would be great if bisync could recover from an exit (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL) without the need of a `--resync`.\r\n\r\ne.g. powercut, Ctrl+C, shutdown\r\n\r\nThis would save the extra work to get it to play nice with everyday usage. Currently, have to run a script to wait for sync(s) to finish then shutdown/restart/etc. In some cases there is nothing that can be done to prevent this such as as system crash or power cut resulting in `--resync` being required. Or sometimes you just want a quick restart due to a kernel/application update or other issue and instead you have to wait or accept the consequences. \r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7470/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7470/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
