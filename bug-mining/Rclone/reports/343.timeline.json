been integrating sftp package into [rclone](https://github.com/ncw/rclone) and it is working very well - a very nicely designed package, thank you.\r\n\r\nHowever a user has noticed a performance problem which I've confirmed - the more latency in the internet connection, the slower the transfers.\r\n\r\nI've been using [netelem](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/networking/netem) to set delays on localhost and trying transfers to and from a local sftp server.\r\n\r\n  * At 1ms delay I get 100 MB/s\r\n  * At 10ms delay I get 73 MB/s\r\n  * At 100ms delay I get 9 MB/s\r\n\r\nrclone uses the `File.ReadFrom` method to upload data.\r\n\r\nI tried increasing `MaxPacket` in the client using a delay of 100ms, but anything greater than the default 32k just seemed to make things
