False alarm. It randomly worked… now it doesn't. I am confused. I need to debug this more.\r\n\r\nEdit2: Okay, super wired. Today I wanted to re-check if the --attr-timeout 10s option influence it. But when I first mounted it, everything worked like a charm. No issues whatsoever. I was using the master version and happily announced here that master has it already fixed.\r\n\r\nThen I tried bisecting it. The old version showed the flawed behavior. Reverted to the latest master version - and it was still broken! :-(\r\n\r\nI am not able to get it to work again correctly. I cannot think of anything I changed. Which could mean it is some wired fuse bug that triggers only if certain state of caches or kernel things… which would be a PITA to debug.\r\n\r\nAt least I can confirm that --attr-timeout 10s does delay the issue by 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nEdit4: I tested using nano which fails to save and only leaves a temporary file.

rclone user discovered that getcwd() fails in subdirectories of rclone mounts https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4104\r\n\r\nI've managed to track this down a bit more precisely.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce with rclone first mount a local directory\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p /tmp/src/sub\r\nrclone mount /tmp/src /mnt/tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn another window\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /mnt/tmp/sub ; ls -l /proc/self/cwd\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 ncw ncw 0 Apr 29 15:55 /proc/self/cwd -> /mnt/tmp/sub\r\n$\r\n$ # wait a few seconds\r\n$ ls -l /proc/self/cwd\r\nrwxrwxrwx 1 ncw ncw 0 Apr 29 15:55 /proc/self/cwd -> '/mnt/tmp/sub (deleted)'\r\n```\r\n\r\n`/proc/self/cwd` being deleted means that for example the `getcwd()` system call fails\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.getcwd()'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nRclone sets attribute timeouts of 1 second by default and if you increase the attribute timeout (with `--attr-timeout`) then the current working directory lasts for longer so it is related to that attribute timeout.\r\n\r\nRclone has a another mount command (you compile it using `--tags cmount`) using libfuse and this does **not** have the same problem which is puzzling, making me think it is something that this library is doing, or maybe something extra that libfuse does.\r\n\r\nI could fix this by increasing the attribute timeout (maybe just for directories) but I don't want to make it very large otherwise changes won't be noticed.\r\n\r\nAny ideas or suggestions much appreciated -
