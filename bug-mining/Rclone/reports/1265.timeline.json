https://github.com/rclone/rclone/actions/runs/8572078457/job/23493782434 - this is partly due to the hard to use web page which involves lots of scrolling within windows, but I think we can do better.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like the tests to print nothing by default, except actual test failures. If we want to see more info then there is the `-verbose` flag (`fstest.Verbose`) which by default enables DEBUG logging, but in bisync's case you can use it to print as much stuff as you want.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @nielash ?\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
