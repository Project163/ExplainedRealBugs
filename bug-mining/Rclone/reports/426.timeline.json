Ubuntu 16.04 x64\n- rclone v1.32\n- Dropbox\n- Command: `rclone -v sync Dropbox:Folder/ ~/www/Folder/`\n- Log (last 5 lines): \n\n> 2016/08/18 15:29:41 [redacted]: Unchanged skipping\n> 2016/08/18

on all three attempts. On every sync.\n#### I have the following situation:\n\nI wan to sync this folder from my Dropbox account down to my server. Which works, but whenever I change something in the Dropbox and run the sync again it will not delete files and folders. \n#### What the problem is:\n\nI also have BitTorrent Sync running on this folder to share it with other people. But BTSync requires a '.sync' folder inside the folder it is supposed to share. I made this folder manually and set the permissions to btsync:btsync (the btsync user) to avoid it being deleted by tools like rclone and other file operations like rm. rclone now wants to delete this folder because it does not exist in the Dropbox, and because it can't, it fails and doesn't delete anything at all. Not even the files I deleted from my Dropbox, it will just leave them there for me to clean up manually, which isn't very convenient with 70000> files.\n\nThe same also happens when I delete the folder contents (minus the .sync folder) and let rclone redownload all the files. Is there any way to exclude the .sync folder (or any local folder it can't access) from rclone?  (--exclude .sync did not work)\n\nI also tried it out a second time. I made a new folder, put a .sync folder inside and changed the owner to www-data:www-data. rclone failed in the same way.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/624/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":847733481,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDg0NzczMzQ4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/847733481","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-04T11:05:19Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.35"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":847733482,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50ODQ3NzMzNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/847733482","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-04T11:05:19Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.34"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-05T17:37:17Z","updated_at":"2016-11-05T17:37:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/848","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/848/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/848/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/848/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/848","id":187130985,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODcxMzA5ODU=","number":848,"title":"ACD

I do not tell it to backup /etc/folderB, which is a system folder with special permissions. (For, I use an --include-from flag and file, and that file does not include that folder.)
