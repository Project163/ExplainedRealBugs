We don't know the size of them in advance so they have to be uploaded with the multipart streaming.\n\nI see that you've set `--streaming-upload-cutoff 100Mi` which is a great idea so what should have happened is that they were streamed into memory and uploaded as a single part.\n\n> ```\n> 2025/05/07 14:10:06 NOTICE: file.xlsx: Failed to cancel multipart upload: itemNotFound: The upload session was not found (upload failed due to: HTTP error 404 (404 Not Found) returned body: \"{\\\"error\\\":{\\\"code\\\":\\\"itemNotFound\\\",\\\"message\\\":\\\"The upload session was not found\\\"}}\")\n> ```\n> \n> I [notice](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/9d55b2411f4c37c3bb3922b7f1177c91f081a3e7/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L2620-L2626) that all uploads are multipart uploads, which I think happens for a file of any non-zero size. The [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-createuploadsession?view=graph-rest-1.0#upload-bytes-to-the-upload-session) says this:\n> \n> _Using a fragment size that doesn't divide evenly by 320 KiB results in errors committing some files._\n> \n> In these cases, the files are smaller than 320 KiB, and the chunk size is the file size, which does not divide evenly by 320 KiB. I can't be sure, but it would seem that files smaller than that threshold should be uploaded outside of the multipart semantics, but I can't find a way to make that happen.\n\nYour last segment is allowed to be less than 320KiB\n\nLooking at the code, we upload all files (except 0 sized files) with multipart upload and have done since 2018 7f744033d8eae0fa916c3207e05cf56d7708fd09 so I don't think this can be the problem.\n\nHere are some edited highlights from the log you sent me uploading `file.xlsx`. I went back to the first time stuff went wrong.
