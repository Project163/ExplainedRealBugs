tool! Thanks for all your work on this and making it available. \n\nUsing `rclone sync` to a drive location, I'm seeing many copies of the same file/same name being created. Saw in the release notes that this was a fix in 1.06, but I've only ever used versions 1.07 and 1.09 (just downloaded 1.10 and will try that as well). \n\nPossible causes include: \n- interrupted transfers? (it's a huge directory and hasn't finished)\n- maybe the deletions only occur after a sync is successful/complete?\n\nAny thoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":243765726,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI0Mzc2NTcyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/243765726","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-02-28T14:30:37Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":243765739,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNDM3NjU3Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/243765739","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-02-28T14:30:43Z","assignee":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/76699340","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/33#issuecomment-76699340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/33","id":76699340,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2Njk5MzQw","user":{"login":"madralphw","id":11233015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjMzMDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11233015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw","html_url":"https://github.com/madralphw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madralphw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-02T11:52:03Z","updated_at":"2015-03-02T11:52:26Z","body":"New

SugarSync (# 33 in 1.56.0) and accepting all defaults and supplying my sugarsync username (email) and password when prompted results in an error message \r\n`Error: failed to get token: HTTP error 401 (401 Unauthorized)`\r\n\r\nI created a new question on the forum here....\r\n[https://forum.rclone.org/t/trouble-getting-sugarsync-remote-configured/25864](url)\r\n\r\nA very helpful person finally confirmed that a sugarsync remote could not be created successfully using rclone 1.56.0 but when rclone was rolled back to 1.55.1, then a sugarsync remote could be created successfully.  I have not independently confirmed this result yet but plan to as soon as I can figure out how to roll back my rclone.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
