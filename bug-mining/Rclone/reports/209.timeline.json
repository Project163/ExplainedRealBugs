My reasoning is that the content-type for a file sitting in a filesystem will generally (with few exceptions for some filesystems) do not have any \"content-type\" metadata associated with them. This is the case, for example, with the extN filesystems running in Linux, and with FAT and NTFS running on Windows: to figure out the content-type, Linux programs (eg, \"file\") look at the file data for signatures, and Windows guesses based on the file extension. I know Macs are (were?) different, with each file having a \"data fork\" for its data and a \"resource fork\" for metadata (presumably including content-type), but this is the exception, not the rule. \n\nIn summary: rclone transfers the _data_ for the file, and a very limited set of the file's metadata (basically just the file name and perhaps the timestamp, but nothing much more). It will almost certainly not try to transfer a content-type even if one is available (eg, Macs) even if the remote cloud storage supports it.  Therefore, what is happening in your case is that the Amazon HTTP server is guessing the content-type wrong (probably because the file has no extension). To prove that, just transfer the file to a cloud filename ending in .JPG and repeat the CURL test: I bet Amazon's HTTP server will return an \"image/jpeg\" for the content-type. \n\nHope that helps. \n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/247883351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DurvalMenezes","id":5405638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDU2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5405638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes","html_url":"https://github.com/DurvalMenezes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DurvalMenezes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/247884592","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/733#issuecomment-247884592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/733","id":247884592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0Nzg4NDU5Mg==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-18T22:17:42Z","updated_at":"2016-09-18T22:17:42Z","body":"Good explanation by @DurvalMenezes though it isn't Amazon guessing the content type from the name, it is rclone (via the go runtime). \n\nI could add an interface to the object which could return the content type.
