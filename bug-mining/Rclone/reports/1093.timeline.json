Pre-Migration Checklist\n\n- [X] I've read the [Migration Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/migrating/).\n- [X] I've checked [AWS Forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-sdk-go) for similar migration issues.\n\n### Go Version Used\n\ngo 1.22\n\n### Describe the Migration Issue\n\nIn the s3 package `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3` the input to the `SSECustomerKey` field in `s3.HeadObjectInput`, `s3.CopyObjectInput`, `s3.GetObjectInput` and `s3.PutObjectInput` (there may be others but I tested those ones) needs to base64 encoded, whereas in the v1 SDK it did not.\r\n\r\nThis is not mentioned in the docs, eg\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/blob/5f159bb2f5f5d8a9c9160869ccdda35be050930f/service/s3/api_op_GetObject.go#L340-L361\r\n\r\nAnd it is not mentioned in the Migration Guide\r\n\r\nSo I can only assume it is either a bug or an undocumented change.\n\n### Code Comparison\n\n_No response_\n\n### Observed Differences/Errors\n\nSDKv1 sends this (note the `X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption-Customer-Key` here is a test key so not sensitive)\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024/08/07 09:56:52 DEBUG : HEAD /README.md HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:

`X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption-Customer-Key` in the SDKv1 is a base64 encoded version of that sent by the SDKv2\r\n\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No
