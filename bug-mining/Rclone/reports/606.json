We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4.

Google drive seems to detect this and when the file is accessed using File-Stream that suffix is put prior to the file extension (Ensuring that the file will still open as normal), However this behavior is not consistent and when viewed from the google drive UI it will show the proper name (as adjusted by rclone when using --suffix).\r\n\r\n![explorer_2019-03-06_09-02-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47841759/53980694-9b0cd800-40d6-11e9-8f12-e279b5f2b475.png)\r\n\r\nIt would actually be useful for rclone to be able to deliberately put the suffix prior to the extension.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/odd-suffix-behavior-team-drives/9034\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nA new flag --suffix-preserve-extension\r\nTo re-locate the added string prior to the extension (if it exists)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Nestar47","id":47841759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQxNzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47841759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47","html_url":"https://github.com/Nestar47","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nestar47/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
