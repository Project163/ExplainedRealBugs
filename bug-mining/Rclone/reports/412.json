The state after this log is the following:\r\n- Test/JD/rand4/rand.bin size=0 mtime=2018-01-29 21:25:18.826 +0100 (mtime of the source)\r\n- Test/JD/rand4/rand.bin size=0 mtime=2018-01-30 14:46:04.??? +0100 (mtime of upload time)\r\n\r\nI assume the problem is `*vfs.RWFileHandle.close()` not being synchronized between multiple files.\r\nThe log file above shows two `close()` executing in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe first `RWFileHandle` belongs to a new empty file. The second one the handle being written to. During the `close()` of the first handle, the empty cache file gets `Move`'ed to the backend. After the move is completed the cache file get's deleted.\r\nWhen the second `close()` tries to move the cache file, which is already gone.\r\n\r\nThis could also be related to #1181.\r\n\r\nI think, `close()` should check whether there is another `RWFileHandle` opened for it's file. Hopefully this fixes the race condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.39-096-gcf6d522d\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux 4.14.13-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Jan 10 11:14:50 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using?
