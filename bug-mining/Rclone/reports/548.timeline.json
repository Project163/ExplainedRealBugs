Could'nt you keep this information for the upload (and detect that here my 28MB file is far from the 5G limit !) ?\r\n\r\nInteresting observation.\r\n\r\nI suspect it is somewhat dependent on what application you use to do the copying so I'm not sure it would be reliable.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind a bit of in-memory buffering then you can increase this\r\n\r\n      --streaming-upload-cutoff int   Cutoff for switching to chunked upload if file size is unknown. Upload starts after reaching cutoff or when file ends. (default 100k)\r\n\r\nOr on disk buffering with `--vfs-cache-mode writes`\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to make a new swift flag say `--swift-stream-no-chunks` which would mean that it would use non chunked uploads.  This would limit the streamed upload to 5GB which is pretty large - maybe that should be the default mode.\r\n\r\nI agree that chunked files in swift are really annoying...  Perhaps the better flag might be `--swift-disable-chunked-upload` which never does a chunked upload and fails for files bigger than 5GB.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/442064876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/442326573","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2776#issuecomment-442326573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2776","id":442326573,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjMyNjU3Mw==","user":{"login":"131","id":13545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/131","html_url":"https://github.com/131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-28T05:39:15Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T05:39:15Z","body":"Ok, using fruncate informations is tempting, but i understand now that it cannot be relied upon.
