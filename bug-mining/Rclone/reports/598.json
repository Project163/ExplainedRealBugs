I have added the source drive to the destination drive as a view only folder, so the remotes are \"gdrive1:RemoteCopy\" and \"gdrive1:LocalCopy\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of a rclone sync-job, rclone tries to delete files from the remote copy. The folder is added as \"view only\", so this of course fails, but why would rclone try to delete from source in the first place:\r\n\r\ncommandline is:\r\n\r\n`rclone -vvv --drive-impersonate user@example.com sync \"gdrive1:RemoteCopy\" gdrive1:LocalCopy\"`\r\n\r\nI am using a service account on gdrive to impersonate user@example.com\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
