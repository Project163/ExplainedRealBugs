The summary should include the following on separate lines:\r\n\r\n1. total amount of data to be transferred,\r\n2. Total files that will be added\r\n3. Total files that will be modified \r\n4. Total files that will be deleted\r\n5. Size of the smallest file and \r\n6. Size of the largest file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, display the size of each file (currently only the file names are displayed in the list format when running with -v)\r\n\r\nThis should work for both regular log formats as well as JSON log formats. It should also work if using cli or in remote control mode\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the dry run does not display any of this information. Change the code to display the summary block as outlined above at the end of the current dry run output. Also, display the file size next to each file displayed currently.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4624/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
