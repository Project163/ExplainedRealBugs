What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.52.3\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.14.7\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nAdd Zoho WorkDrive to supported cloud providers.\r\n\r\nHere is an API: https://writer.zohopublic.com/writer/published/ankqibdb934759c6446bca8899b2f426428fc\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nWhile Zoho have TrueSync Beta (Streaming) and WorkDrive Sync (Full downloads) it would be good if rclone can integrate it as a source/dest without having to mount the drive using the Zoho sync tools.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4533/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
