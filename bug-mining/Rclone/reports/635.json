What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nWhen uploading a single file to a OneDrive folder, it can get skipped if the file already exists in the root folder and the destination folder does not exist.\r\n\r\nThis happens because [readMetaDataForPath](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/b9e16b36e5208dc7460af59d9e75dc8234caca27/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L356) calls `f.dirCache.Get(\"\")` and assumes the it got the right folder ID.\r\n\r\nIf `f.root` (`foldera` or `foldera/folderb` in the log below) does not exist, the returned folder ID is actually the drive root and `f.dirCache.foundRoot` is still false.\r\n\r\nI assume the right function in this case should be `f.dirCache.FindRoot(false)` instead of `f.dirCache.Get(\"\")`, but I'm not sure if this would break the issue in [onedrive.go#L379](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/b9e16b36e5208dc7460af59d9e75dc8234caca27/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L379) again.\r\n\r\n@Cnly any thoughts how this should be fixed?\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n`v1.47.0-032-gb9e16b36-beta`\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64
