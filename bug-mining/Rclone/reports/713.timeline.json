What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nSince ba7c2ac443233ec4b73eed1054bd68c59eb3d8dd, accessing a Google Drive remote adds a root_folder_id to the config file. Thereafter, thanks to 473a437163027ae6116b948a71d2de467890f2d2 , the `--drive-team-drive` flag (or equivalent environment variable) is ignored on that remote. I'm not entirely clear on the motivation behind the second change (nor have I used `--drive-shared-with-me`), but surely a manually specified team drive should take precedence over the autogenerated root folder id?\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nThe issue occurs with 1.51.0 and 1.50.2. Rolling back to 1.50.1 fixes it.\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu 18.04, 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nAny command using --drive-team-drive, after running any command without it once on the same remote.
