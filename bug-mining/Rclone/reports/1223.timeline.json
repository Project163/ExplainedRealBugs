The size is wrong though 13,561,509 is smaller than the correct size of 13,563,975 by 2,466 bytes\r\n\r\nDirectly on the mount the file looks like this, so the size looks correct\r\n\r\n```\r\n# md5sum /mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\na3d432d95acb1b27fbe61a034a5291a0  /mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n# ls -l /mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 13563975 Mar 22 16:51 /mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is a different hash again!\r\n\r\nIf I try downloading that file with wget\r\n\r\n    wget https://beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n\r\nit doesn't work with the server stopping at `Connection closed at byte 13561509` which is what you might expect\r\n\r\nCopying the file direct from the mount truncates it\r\n\r\n```\r\n# cp -av /mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip /tmp/z\r\n'/mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip' -> '/tmp/z'\r\n# ls -l /tmp/z\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 13561509 Mar 22 16:51 /tmp/z\r\n# ls -l /mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 13563975 Mar 22 16:51 /mnt/beta.rclone.org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file in the cache looks like this on the server\r\n\r\n```\r\n# md5sum /home/www-data/.cache/rclone/vfs/memstore/beta-rclone-org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\na3d432d95acb1b27fbe61a034a5291a0  /home/www-data/.cache/rclone/vfs/memstore/beta-rclone-org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n# ls -l /home/www-data/.cache/rclone/vfs/memstore/beta-rclone-org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n-rw------- 1 www-data www-data 13561509 Mar 22 16:51 /home/www-data/.cache/rclone/vfs/memstore/beta-rclone-org/rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it is the incorrect short size (matching the metadata) but not the actual file.\r\n\r\nSo what looks like happened is the cache and the actual file system got out of sync. What will have happened is that the `rclone-beta-latest-freebsd-arm.zip` will have got updated in the swift bucket, but somehow rclone did not notice the new size. It clearly did notice the new fingerprint because it has that.\r\n\r\nIf I look at a diff between the downloaded file and the correct file I see\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ diff -u <(hd
