Make sure you test with the [latest beta of rclone](http://rclone.org/downloads/).\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question then please use the [rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/) instead of filing an issue.\r\n\r\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\nrclone v1.34\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nDebian 8 Jessie 64 bit\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n> The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrclone mount gdrive: /mnt/gdrive --allow-other\r\n> A log from the command with the `-v` flag (eg output from `rclone -v copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nMy issue is that rclone needs a max size on mount much like acd_cli does it. With no max size samba reports that there is errors due to the way df works on the mount. \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/N7oTw4o.png\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/894/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/894/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
