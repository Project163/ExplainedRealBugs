We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.50.2\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nAdd a flag for copyurl to check if there is not an existing file on the destination with the same name to prevent overwriting. Additionally, check if `--auto-filename` will not overwrite an existing file on destination. It was also discussed [here](https://forum.rclone.org/t/copyurl-same-file-name-overwrite/13660).\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nHere is the source of the copyurl command: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/copyurl/copyurl.go\r\n\r\nAdding the `--no-clobber` flag at the source of the copyurl command it on to operations.CopyURL @ https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/fs/operations/operations.go\r\nAlso, I'd need to implement a destination check to prevent overwriting with the `--auto-filename` .\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
