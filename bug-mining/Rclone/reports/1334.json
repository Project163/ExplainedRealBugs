We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n1.67\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nI have 3 vfs remotes and the log looks like this:\r\n```\r\n2024-07-15T14:11:59.014244+02:00 node2 rclone[33627]: INFO  : vfs cache: cleaned: objects 8822 (was 8822) in use 3055, to upload 2981, uploading 4, total size 9.910Ti (was 9.910Ti)\r\n2024-07-15T14:11:59.691251+02:00 node2 rclone[33627]: INFO  : vfs cache: cleaned: objects 61 (was 61) in use 31, to upload 0, uploading 0, total size 39.361Gi (was 39.361Gi)\r\n2024-07-15T14:12:00.234393+02:00 node2 rclone[33627]: INFO  : vfs cache: cleaned: objects 28 (was 28) in use 1, to upload 1, uploading 0, total size 89.346Gi (was 89.346Gi)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nThe name of the remote should be added to the log line so I can identify to which remote the statistics belong to.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
