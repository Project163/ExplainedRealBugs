(30mins vs 2mins with Powershell)\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the code I found that lsf calls lsjson and lsjson steps through and performs each hash sequentially on the file.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/8e91f83174cc4011158c596d0c8569cd226fc36d/fs/operations/lsjson.go#L155-L162\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to rewrite this in a few ways, \r\n\r\n- One to pass a command line option to perform an array of hashes e.g. something like MD5,SHA256,SHA512 etc (from the list of already supported hashes) defaulting to all if not supplied\r\n- Two to read the file once and perform all requested hashes concurrently to reduce disk access wear and IO bottle necks\r\n- Three to perform the multiple hashes in a way where each one is on it's own thread to make use of multicore CPU's and reduce CPU as a bottle neck\r\n\r\nUnfortunatly my Go skills will allow me to build a custom rclone binary that only does an MD5 hash but I don't think I would be able to add the above functionality to a pull request.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
