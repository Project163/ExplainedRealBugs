It somehow ignores the `B` suffix and interprets the value as `KiB`.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nI tested it with v1.68.2 and with beta.\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nI tried it on my local Arch Linux machine and with docker\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nBug occurs when just copying from local file system to local file system, but I think it will occur for any storage system.\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nThe easiest to reproduce is using this docker command that show cases the full problem without any required pre-setup:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run --entrypoint sh rclone/rclone:1.68.2 -c \"\r\nmkdir /tmp/source && \\\r\nmkdir /tmp/target && \\\r\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/source/file-with-1023-bytes.txt bs=1023 count=1 status=none && \\\r\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/source/file-with-1024-bytes.txt bs=1024 count=1 status=none && \\\r\nrclone copy /tmp/source /tmp/target --min-size 1B -vv && \\\r\nls /tmp/target\r\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried also with beta replacing `rclone/rclone:1.68.2` with `rclone/rclone:beta` in above call but the result is the same. Also if I replace `rclone copy` with `rclone sync` the result is the same. Furthermore, if I replace `--min-size 1B` with `--min-size 2B` both files get excluded which shows that the value gets interpreted as `KiB` instead of `B`\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nThe output I get with above docker command is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.68.2\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"/tmp/source\" \"/tmp/target\" \"--min-size\" \"1B\" \"-vv\"]\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/source\"\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 NOTICE: Config file \"/config/rclone/rclone.conf\" not found - using defaults\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/target\"\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : file-with-1023-bytes.txt: Excluded (Size Filter)\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : file-with-1023-bytes.txt: Excluded\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : file-with-1024-bytes.txt: Need to transfer - File not found at Destination\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/target: Waiting for checks to finish\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : Local file system at /tmp/target: Waiting for transfers to finish\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : file-with-1024-bytes.txt: md5 = 0f343b0931126a20f133d67c2b018a3b OK\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : file-with-1024-bytes.txt.1a99980b.partial: renamed to: file-with-1024-bytes.txt\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 INFO  : file-with-1024-bytes.txt: Copied (new)\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:   \t        1 KiB / 1 KiB, 100%, 0 B/s, ETA -\r\nTransferred:            1 / 1, 100%\r\nElapsed time:         0.0s\r\n\r\n2024/11/27 22:55:02 DEBUG : 8 go routines active\r\nfile-with-1024-bytes.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we see the 1023 bytes large file gets excluded by the size filter although the size filter is 1B which should be 1 byte.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

:-) We understand you are having a problem with rclone; we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum:\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\ninstead of filing an issue for a quick response.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nIn general it is not possible to configure size (SizeSuffix type) options with a value less than 1K. E.g. `--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit=1B` will set the option to 1024 bytes  (1K) instead of 1 byte as requested (ignore the meaning of the option, it is just a random example). Perhaps only an \"academic\" issue, if there currently are no options where values less than 1K is relevant?\r\n\r\nPart of the explanation is that the \"ToString\" and \"FromString\" of SizeSuffix are \"mismatched\": The `String()` function will output a value without suffix if < 1K. The `Set()` function will default interpret strings without suffix as KiB, and expects strings with suffix \"B\" for byte values.\r\nThe other part of the explanation is the handling and parsing of option: The input \"1B\" is correctly parsed into a SizeSuffix value 1, but it is somewhere along the way (via `Set` function in configstruct, I think) made into a string and back to a SizeSuffix - which triggers the first part of the explanation.\r\n\r\nThe following test (which has not been committed anywhere) illustrates the first part of the explanation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc TestSizeSuffixStringSet(t *testing.T) {\r\n\tfor _, v := range []float64{\r\n\t\t0,                         // \"0\"\r\n\t\t102,                       // \"102\" <-- FAILS: expected: 102 (\"102B\"), actual: 104448 (\"102Ki\")\r\n\t\t1024,                      // \"1Ki\"\r\n\t\t1024 * 1024,               // \"1Mi\"\r\n\t\t1024 * 1024 * 1024,        // \"1Gi\"\r\n\t\t10 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,   // \"10Gi\"\r\n\t\t10.1 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // \"10.100Gi\"\r\n\t} {\r\n\t\tss1 := SizeSuffix(v)\r\n\t\tss1s := ss1.String()\r\n\t\tss2 := SizeSuffix(0)\r\n\t\terr := ss2.Set(ss1s)\r\n\t\trequire.NoError(t, err, ss1s)\r\n\t\tassert.Equal(t, int64(ss1), int64(ss2))\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDetected as part of testing https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5087. I *may* look further into the case as part of that pull request, but no promises... :)\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.55.0-DEV (built from master as of 25 Mar 2021)\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n \r\nWindows 10, 64-bit\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16731141614,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M6tJIOuzwAAAAPlQPXu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/16731141614","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-13T09:58:58Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16731142510,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAQ-n5M6tJIOuzwAAAAPlQPlu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/16731142510","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-13T09:59:02Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.70"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2720668188","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8437#issuecomment-2720668188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8437","id":2720668188,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6iKhoc","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-13T10:02:51Z","updated_at":"2025-03-13T10:02:51Z","body":"Thanks for pointing those out @albertony \n\nYour initial diagnosis in #5169 is correct - it is the non value preserving roundtrip through string that is the problem. I tried fixing that first which worked but it broke too many other things with `B` suffixes appearing where they shouldn't. My second attempt is laser focussed on the Option parsing which fixes this issue, #5169 and #8212 \n\nWhile I was thinking about it I make a wiki page for backwards incompatible changes we should make to any potential v2 of rclone.
