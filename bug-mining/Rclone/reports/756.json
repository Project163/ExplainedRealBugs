We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nv1.48\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nWhen calling rclone move (or similar commands) and there is nothing for rclone to upload, it prints this log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019/08/18 06:11:43 INFO  : Starting HTTP transaction limiter: max 10 transactions/s with burst 1\r\n2019/08/18 06:11:43 INFO  : Google drive root '': Waiting for checks to finish\r\n2019/08/18 06:11:43 INFO  : Google drive root '': Waiting for transfers to finish\r\n2019/08/18 06:11:43 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:             0 / 0 Bytes, -, 0 Bytes/s, ETA -\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:                 0 / 0, -\r\nTransferred:            0 / 0, -\r\nElapsed time:          0s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ends up being super confusing for users, they look at this and think something is wrong, when nothing is wrong. I've so far worked around it by doing a check on the number of files in the upload directory, but it's not ideal.\r\n\r\nThey find these lines in particular confusing `Google drive root '': Waiting for checks to finish`\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nInstead of printing this zeroed out log entry, perhaps just print \"No files were found that needed action for this operation\" or something along those lines.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
