It sounds like this normalization is necessary in many (most?) cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, this means that if a file is not in a normalized form its name will be different after a round-trip through a storage system. This can cause issues if you expect filenames to be match byte-for-byte.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a new flag (e.g. `--no-unicode-normalization`) to disable normalization?    I imagine the flag would cause issues in some situations but in others it seems like it would allow you to retain the original filenames. For example, if you are using a `crypt` remote (w/encrypted filenames) and a filesystem that stores filenames as a sequence bytes it seems like you could get away without normalization.\r\n\r\nAre there other issues with skipping normalization that I'm not aware of?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
