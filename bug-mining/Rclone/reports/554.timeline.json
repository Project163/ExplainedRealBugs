For user-linked apps this means rate limits apply per user who has linked your app. Multiple apps that a user may have linked don’t contribute to each other’s rate limiting.`\r\n\r\nIf we re-issue a `rclone authorize \"dropbox\"` it regenerate the api token but the app remains the same. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if there could be a trick to have multiple rclone apps inside dropbox to bypass this rate limit and have in the rclone config file several remote sections for dropbox: `dropbox`, `dropbox2`,

But... It is always 300 sec it seems... So it triggers a wait of 5min each time dropbox asks to sleep... Which is quite big... So here are some tests I did with one of my big sync task.\r\n\r\nWith the latest rclone and `--skip-links --modify-window 2s --log-level INFO --tpslimit 9`: sync time is ~54mins\r\n\r\nWith the modifications from #2622 and `--skip-links --modify-window 2s --log-level DEBUG`, it uses the Retry-After value that is sent back by dropbox and then we can see some wait during 5 minutes, as seen below in the logs. This same big sync task finishes in ~30mins...\r\n\r\nIn both cases, no transfer happens, only checks.\r\n\r\nSo I see value in supporting Retry-After for sync tasks that are short and thus would benefit of a higher request rate, but also that are long, like in this case. So generally speaking, even if Dropbox 5mins wait time seems big, using it instead of a low request rate (`--tpslimit 9`) is better.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018/10/03 15:13:05 DEBUG : ovea/testatoo/.git/objects/67/dd222c58a8ad556c6d3955ef0e98047f12da67: Unchanged skipping\r\n2018/10/03 15:13:05 DEBUG : too_many_requests/...: Too many requests or write operations.
