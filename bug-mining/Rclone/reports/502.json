The policy reported as causing the issue was: \r\n\r\n```\r\n{  \r\n   “Version”:“2012-10-17”,\r\n   “Id”:“PutObjPolicy”,\r\n   “Statement”:[  \r\n      {  \r\n         “Sid”:“DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads”,\r\n         “Effect”:“Deny”,\r\n         “Principal”:\"\",\r\n         “Action”:         “s3:PutObject”,\r\n         “Resource”:\"arn:aws:s3:::YourBucket/\",\r\n         “Condition”:{  \r\n            “StringNotEquals”:{  \r\n               “s3:               x-amz-server-side-encryption”:               “aws:kms”\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am submitting the issue on behalf of the original reporter and do not have answers to the standard issue questions.\r\n\r\nIt appears rclone needs to support the `--server-side-encryption aws:kms` and `--sse-kms-key-id <value>` flags as available in the AWS S3 CLI. See [AWS S3 Sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html) for an example.\r\n\r\nI’m not 100% sure, but a quick look at the SDK looks like the s3crypto service may contain what’s needed to implement this: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/s3/s3crypto/\r\n\r\nGood general AWS documentation about S3 and KMS encryption is available at:\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-s3.html#sse\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html\r\n- https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-prevent-uploads-of-unencrypted-objects-to-amazon-s3/","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2217/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
