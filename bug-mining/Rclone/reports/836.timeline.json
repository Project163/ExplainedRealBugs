What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThe traditional OpenSSH `sftp` command supports specifying the SSH subsystem or the SFTP server via the `-s` option. This PR adds two options to the sftp backend: `subsystem` and `server_command`. \r\n\r\nThe `subsystem` option is useful if the target server has multiple SFTP subsystems defined for users.\r\n\r\nThe `server_command` option can be useful if `sudo` is required to elevate the user sftp session, without the need to SSH as root user.\r\n\r\nThe new `newSftpClient()` function is essentially a just reimplementation of [sftp.NewClient](https://godoc.org/github.com/pkg/sftp#NewClient) to support custom subsystem or execution of a custom SFTP server on the remote host.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nIt was briefly discussed in 2017 in issue #1801.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution
