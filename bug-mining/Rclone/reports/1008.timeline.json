What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n````\r\n>>= rclone --version\r\nrclone v1.55.1-DEV\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.16.4\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n````\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nI am trying to use rclone to automate backing up public, but endanged files. Once I had my build system breaking since file\r\ndisappeared from CTAN, so I'd rather mirror files I care about on multiple free hostings.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nrclone has \"link\" subcommand, but links generated with this subcommand are links to web-interface, not to file itself (at least I tried Microsoft OneDrive and  Koofr), so they can't be downloaded automatically with, e.g curl. \r\n\r\nI worked a lot with Dropbox and know that their public links end with \"?dl=0\", and if you replace it with \"?dl=1\", resulting link becomes direct. I think something similar should exist for other services, and this knowledge -- how to convert link to web-interface into direct link (I doubt usefulness of web-interface links in general, but this is another story) -- should be embedded into rclone code.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to introduce new option \"--direct\" to \"link\" subcommand, that should return direct link if it supported by service, or error-out if it is not supported or it is impossible to get it automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with this idea, I would probably be able to provide patch for dropbox and koofr (I think I got their link logic).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4872146123,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0ODcyMTQ2MTIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4872146123","actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-10T15:19:28Z","assignee":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4873005021,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ4NzMwMDUwMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4873005021","actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3713e4927ef8e712c5f95fd14dbc5be8bc950024","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/albertony/rclone/commits/3713e4927ef8e712c5f95fd14dbc5be8bc950024","created_at":"2021-06-10T17:47:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-10T17:48:41Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T17:48:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issue

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nTwo small improvements to Jottacloud backend:\r\n1. Add support for UserInfo feature\r\n   - Not sure exactly what information to return... Docs says \"details of the person logged in to the cloud storage system\". Not many backends seem to implement this feature, so not much precedence to look at. Is it for specific \"information about person\", or is it for a wider scope - dump of any user/account/person related information?\r\n   - I'm currently returning username, name, email, account type and subscription type, from the CustomerInfo response from backend: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/92b3518c78848d454a7352707fa7c849fd93403a/backend/jottacloud/api/types.go#L146-L164\r\n2. Change link command from returning web url to returning a direct download link, which is the preferred strategy as mentioned here: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5381#issuecomment-856935146\r\n    - If the shared path is a directory, then the download will be a zip archive.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #5391\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution
