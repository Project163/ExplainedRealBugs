(eg Google Drive)\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrclone copy gdrive:test/ copy2/ --files-from ls2.txt -v -v --stats 10s --log-file log.download2.5m.fastlist --fast-list\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nAttached. It's large, because this problem only shows up once you have a certain number of files in your remote, that you're trying to pull.\r\n[rclone.log](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/files/3051890/rclone.log)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
