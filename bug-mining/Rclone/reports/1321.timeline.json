A more elegant solution would be to implement this within the oauthutil module.\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed in #6197.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6197\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [ ] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [ ] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [ ] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6343/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1295662330","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6197#issuecomment-1295662330","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6197","id":1295662330,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5NOjz6","user":{"login":"gursharan001","id":3032971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzI5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3032971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001","html_url":"https://github.com/gursharan001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gursharan001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-29T00:33:20Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T00:33:20Z","body":"My apologies for disappearing. @martin-redmaple, please let me know if you plan to fix the conflicts with your PR.
