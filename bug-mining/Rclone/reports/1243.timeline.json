This is great feedback. I think there are two issues here, both with easy fixes:\r\n\r\n- Bisync should reset the error count in between each retry (it currently does not -- this is why it kept retrying after you unlocked the file.)\r\n- Bisync should implement support for `--retries-sleep`\r\n\r\nI should be able to address these pretty quickly (and post a new version to try, if you'd like!)\r\n\r\n> anything causes tons of verbose output.\r\n\r\nIt is verbose because the `-v` flag was included -- you can omit this flag to make it less verbose (or add `-q` for even less). That said, if there are certain messages you think should be downgraded from `NOTICE` to `INFO` or `INFO` to `DEBUG`, let me know and I'm happy to consider changing them 🙂 \r\n\r\n> stability seems good. next run recovers automatically.\r\n\r\nGlad to hear it! 🙂

(Your last `-v` log cuts off at `NOTICE: will retry in 10s at 2024-01-10 08:59:25 CET`, so I can't see what happened after that... did the retries succeed or fail?) \r\n\r\nSo far, I have not seen anything unexpected in my tests, or in the excerpts you posted from your logs. Your OS failed to copy the file, so rclone logged this as an error and exited with an error status. That is what I'd expect to happen.\r\n\r\n> When i set up `--log-level ERROR` then i expect nothing in relation to my tests. But i see many error logs in verbose mode.\r\n\r\n`--log-level ERROR` still reports errors -- it just suppresses everything else. It sounds to me like the log-level is more of a side-effect, and the real issue here is that rclone is considering something to be an error that you do not consider to be an error. I think what you are saying is that you are not concerned about this `Couldn't delete` error, because bisync can try again on a future run, and sooner or later it will succeed, once the file is closed. Is that right? That sounds reasonable to me. What is tricky though is: how should rclone decide which errors are concerning to the user, and which errors are not? From rclone's perspective, its job was to copy a file, and it failed to do so. Rclone's expectation is that the dest should always match the source at the end of a sync, or else something went wrong.\r\n\r\nI think probably the best solution would be a new flag to allow these kinds of errors to be ignored. But we still have to give rclone some criteria to determine which errors to care about. Do you have suggestions for how it should decide? (What is an example of an error you _would_ want to be fatal?)\r\n\r\n> `2024/01/10 08:59:15 ERROR : Local file system at //?/C:/TBD/Test: not deleting files as there were IO errors`\r\n> Is not an error, it's a result of the above one.\r\n\r\nThis one I am pretty sure can be ignored with the `--ignore-errors` flag. Or rather, the error will still be reported, but it will not be considered fatal and will not prevent the deletions. Let me know if you have a chance to try it.\r\n\r\n> My idea using `--suffix datetime` like microtime or `--suffix date` only date. For scenarios that no data loss can be accepted, this flag renames the files unique before move to `--backup-dirN`\r\n\r\nIt's a great idea, and I think it would be useful for `sync` and `move` as well. `--conflict-suffix` already supports all of [these formats](https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants).\r\n\r\n> Yes that's correct! The idea is seen global - not to a specific sync. purge all where the `--min-age` filter is applicable.\r\n> Then users can plan with a storage budget and doesn't purge manually.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. I think if it's global and not specific to a sync, then probably it makes more sense to just schedule a new cron job for `rclone delete [some:dir] --min-age [x]`. I'm not sure I see an advantage to triggering this from `sync` or `bisync`, and I think it could be problematic for a sync to be deleting things from a backup-dir that weren't related to the sync. But that's just my opinion -- feel free to open a new issue for it if you like, and it can be discussed!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1886082125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11519566051,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M57e9jRzwAAAAKunqDj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/11519566051","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1fa12701d67363a93b77d25002917999916b8319","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nielash/rclone/commits/1fa12701d67363a93b77d25002917999916b8319","created_at":"2024-01-18T03:19:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-18T03:25:23Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T03:25:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7577","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7577/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7577/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7577/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7577","id":2087405336,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAQ-n5M5kYLDQ","number":7577,"title":"bisync: add support for `--retries-sleep` -
