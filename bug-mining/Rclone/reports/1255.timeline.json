At least this will prevent the user from falling into the trap, as it is now: the files are uploaded, but there is actually no access to them.\r\n2. Add a new encoder for file names with a function to shorten the name length, even if it is not crypto-resistant.\r\n3.

Store the IDs of directories and files locally instead of constantly using the `api/open/file_search` request (perhaps such  option is already in rclone somewhere?)\r\n5. Somehow, the UI Explorer (http://127.0.0.1:5572/#/remoteExplorer) can show a list of files in directories with long names, but `rclone ls` cannot. (However, the explorer fails to download these files). Perhaps it's possible somehow to use some functionality from there.\r\n\r\nIt just turns out that Linkbox is now on the list, but in fact it is not working / not

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nLinkBox API does not allow searching by more than 25 Unicode characters in the name, for this reason it is currently impossible to work with files and folders named longer than 8 Unicode chars (if encoded in base32). This fix queries all files in a long named directory and checks names there one by one, thus solving the issue.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum
