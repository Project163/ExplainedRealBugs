You can already so this with env variables so adding a command line flag for this would be easy I think.\r\n\r\nYou could then specify everything you need for a transfer on the command line\r\n\r\n    rclone sync /path b2:bucket --make-remote b2=b2 --b2-account=12312312 --b2-key=12312123\r\n\r\nAnother idea was to use the special remote syntax `:type:path` eg `:b2:bucket` which would create a b2 remote using the command line parameters.  This is less typing, but less flexible as you wouldn't be able to configure two b2 remotes on the command line.  Eg\r\n\r\n    rclone sync /path :+1: b2:bucket --b2-account=12312312 --b2-key=12312123\r\n\r\nThis would be very useful syntax for one off sftp or http remotes.\r\n\r\nFrom [this thread](https://forum.rclone.org/t/can-rclone-be-run-solely-with-command-line-options-no-config-no-env-vars/6314/) in the forum.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2449/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
