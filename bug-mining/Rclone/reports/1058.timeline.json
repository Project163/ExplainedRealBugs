What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nMain purpose is to updated according to Go version 1.17: Use `go install` instead of `go get`.\r\n\r\nIncluded additional information regarding cmount buildtag, required winfsp installation on windows, and \"optimized builds\" with `-ldflags -s`.\r\n\r\nMaybe the text should be split into subsections now? E.g. the \"git + go build\" method vs the \"go install/go get\" method? (Not sure what to name the headers then)\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #5809\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution
