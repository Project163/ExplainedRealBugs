See https://forum.rclone.org/t/unexpected-deletions-in-gdrive/3421 for user-level discussion. This issue is about rclone itself.\r\n\r\nA new user just getting to know rclone may naturally explore the sync command. A typical such user will try out the arguments, using trial and error until they are just right.\r\n\r\nFor example, they may do this:\r\nrclone sync to from\r\n\r\nAnd of course that won't work. The order of the arguments is:\r\nrclone sync from to\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no second chance. The first command will have wiped out the \"from\" directory. \r\n\r\n- The deletion is permanent. There is no undo or trash can. \r\n- The deletion is recursive. If you are looking to sync from the root of your remote directory, everything is gone.\r\n- The deletion is massive. Thousands or tens of thousands of files can disappear.\r\n- The deletion includes git history, so no restore will be possible.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix: \r\n\r\n1. A prompt should ask the user to confirm they want to delete the target permanently \r\n2. A -f flag should suppress the prompt\r\n3. Consider an undo feature\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1574/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1574/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/319658143","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1573#issuecomment-319658143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1573","id":319658143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTY1ODE0Mw==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-02T12:31:40Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T12:31:40Z","body":"Here is a beta which should fix the issue.
