What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\nReserve possibility for future chunker/rclone releases to add more control information (which can be used to implement resumable uploads etc) in a way that future types of hidden chunks don't play jack-in-the-box in file listings of unaware past releases.\r\n\r\nSubgoals:\r\n* keep metadata format estableshed earlier\r\n* postpone creation of internal structures for future, only prepare chunk name and metadata validators\r\n* rectify validation so that future control structures can't be accidentally corrupted by past releases\r\n* polish terminology in docs and comments (in fact 70% of the diff).\r\n\r\nSecurity fixes:\r\n* reject or report attempts to corrupt chunks (in fact remaining 20% of the diff)\r\n* reject huge numbers in chunk name, prevent memory overflow\r\n* specially handle user files containing valid chunker metadata  (currently treated as corrupted composites upon upload)\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n* implement consistent hashing option\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nNo, but it's good :)\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution
