Wish I could contribute actual code, but for now can only contribute testing results.  It's great to be able to create simple scripts that interact with these different cloud storage services.  I'm surprised this seems to be one of the few cross platform command line tools doing this.\n\nI'm using it mostly with Google Drive for now but plan to use with S3 as well.  With Google Drive, I'm experiencing the error I think you are aware of when it operates over several GB worth of data and a large directory tree - Drive seems to not like all of the requests or something and it throws an error.\n\nInterestingly, when I map Google Drive using Expandrive, and then use rsync, I don't get this error.  This may be because Expandrive slows down the requests due to it's own internal workings?  There are other problems with mapping a drive and then using the command line so I'd much rather not have to involve the drive mapping and just use the command line.\n\nIf there is some way I can help please let me know.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
