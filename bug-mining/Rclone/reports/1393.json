We love that!\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\n\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\n\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\n\n  1.
