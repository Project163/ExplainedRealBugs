now only Google Drive and Dropbox are included.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this command is to quickly get a sharable link to hand to friends. Drive supports full ACLs, Dropbox offers password protection and automatic expiry (paid accounts). Not sure if it makes sense to implement these provider specific features. The most likeliest feature to add would probably to \"unshare\", which could be equally universal.\r\n\r\nIt's an optional interface for `Fs`, although it would probably fit nicely on `Object` as well. As it is now, it supports sharing directories. Getting dir sharing to work via `Object` would likely benefit from having a standardized `Directory` type first. I haven't surveyed the other storage providers yet, so maybe demanding directory sharing through the integration tests will have to change.\r\n\r\nNote that the Google Drive intergration test fails for me at `TestObjectRemove`, even on master.\r\n\r\nThere is one edge case in the Drive implementation that I left unsolved: on a team drive, if I lack permissions (i.e. `canShare: false`) this implementation will bail. Instead, it could check what permissions the file/dir already has, and return the link if they are already sufficient. I'd revisit this if someone actually runs into this issue.\r\n\r\nAs always, I am happy to address any feedback.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1539280088,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1MzkyODAwODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1539280088","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-24T17:10:02Z","label":{"name":"Remote: Drive","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/375910722","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2177#issuecomment-375910722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2177","id":375910722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTkxMDcyMg==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-24T17:35:06Z","updated_at":"2018-03-24T17:35:06Z","body":"Using the magic of git bisect...\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit bisect start\r\ngit checkout 572ee5ec\r\n( cd backend/drive && go test -v ) #
