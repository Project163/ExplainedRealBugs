What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nPrograms that use the `getcwd()` syscall fail when inside an rclone mount with `ENOENT`.\r\n\r\nFor example I go into a rclone mounted drive `cd ~/dropbox/Documents`, then run something like `node -p \"process.cwd()\"`, this fails with `ENOENT`.\r\n\r\nI even made a basic C script with nothing but the syscall:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <limits.h>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  char cwd[PATH_MAX];\r\n  if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)) != NULL) {\r\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", cwd);\r\n  } else {\r\n    perror(\"getcwd() error\");\r\n    return 1;\r\n  }\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich also fails, so this confirms it's the syscall failing and not something in Node/Python.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This only fails in a subdirectory, it does not fail in the mount directory itself e.g. `~/mount/` is fine, but `~/mount/subdirectory/` is not.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n1.51.0\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04 and 19.10 both fail.\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nMultiple, failed for WebDAV (nextcloud), Dropbox and Google Drive.\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nThe WebDAV (nextcloud) is mounted as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n/usr/bin/rclone mount nextcloud:/ /home/jamesernator/nextcloud\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe google drive is mounted as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n/usr/bin/rclone mount googleDrive:/ /home/jamesernator/googleDrive --dir-cache-time 30s --cache-dir /home/jamesernator/.rclone-mount-cache/ --vfs-cache-max-age 720h0m0s --vfs-cache-mode full --vfs-cache-max-size 2G\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd dropbox is mounted using a [cache remote](https://rclone.org/cache/) with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n/usr/bin/rclone mount dropbox-cache:/ /home/jamesernator/dropbox\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: All are mounted automatically through systemd services, however manually mounting does not fix the situation.\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nThis logs contains the results of running `rclone mount -vv \"nextcloud:/\" ~/nextcloud-test/ 2> out.log\" followed by the following two commands in `zsh` (in a separate shell):\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\ncd nextcloud-test/Documents\r\nnode -e 'process.cwd()'\r\n```\r\n\r\n[out.log](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/files/4419026/out.log)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4104/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
