famously doesn't allow user access to FUSE mounts, because google and the phone companies are full of shit and call it a security flaw, as if they couldn't force setuid off everytime.\n\nAs a mulligan for the backlash, google created the much slower, memory hungry and awkward (I'm not going to say this is anything but a workaround) SAF API, that allows selected applications that code support of it to plug in support for \"exotic filesystems\" into googles filechooser.\n\nThis lead to apps like [RSAF](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/RSAF) to be able to use networked filesystems to deliver a view of networked files to programs that didn't expect to be handed networked files, which is useful (if not as useful as actual nfs), in this case using rclone.\n\nUnfortunately rclone can't actually mount squash files without root. \n\nSo this is a request to use [backhand](https://github.com/wcampbell0x2a/backhand) (a library to read and uncompress squash files from user space) to add a command for that. \n\nI'm aware this is unlikely to be coded because it's complex and fiddly and backhand is a rust library not Go, and not exactly in rclone main interest of networked filesystems, but rclone mount does exist, and it doesn't work in non rooted android, so I might as well open it for the main use case I'm interested in.
