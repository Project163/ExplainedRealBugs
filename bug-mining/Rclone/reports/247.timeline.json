The deployed package creates the folders and shares. Then...\n2.) Downloads rclone + config file from google drive.\n3.) Initiates the download of the files with a download rate I've set and logs it to a file.\n4.) Once the download is complete it uploads the log file with the computer name and timestamp.\n\nThis gives me the ability to see the progress across multi pal wan sites and if there are no log files then its either busy downloading still or failed. \n\nIn a nut shell.\n\nControl all the files on google and it mimics at the destinations.

The way I was envisioning this was to always scan the\n\"time slots\" and see where we currently fit, setting the bw limiter to that\nvalue.\n\nSo, say, someone says 08:00,1M, 23:00,5M, it means that at any point in the\nday, we'll be doing 1M (08:00 to 22:59) or 5M (23:00 to 07:59). Of course,\nif only one time slot is used, then we'll be at that limit for the whole\nday. :)\n\nOn Sun, Oct 30, 2016 at 1:01 PM, Nick Craig-Wood notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @marcopaganini https://github.com/marcopaganini I guess the default\n> limit is what you get until you get to one of the trigger times when the\n> bandwidth limit changes.
