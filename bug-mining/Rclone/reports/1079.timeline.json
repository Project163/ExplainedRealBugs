This change removes the close() call from Flush() and replaces it with FlushWrites() so that the file only gets closed when Release() is called. The new FlushWrites method takes care of actually writing the file back to the underlying storage.\r\n\r\nFixes #3381\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3381\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-mount-vfs-cache-doesnt-appear-to-handle-dup-calls-gracefully/11030\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4527896569,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ1Mjc4OTY1Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4527896569","actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-30T13:58:38Z","label":{"name":"good first issue","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1175254787","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3270#issuecomment-1175254787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3270","id":1175254787,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5GDPcD","user":{"login":"FiloSpaTeam","id":2974561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzQ1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2974561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam","html_url":"https://github.com/FiloSpaTeam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FiloSpaTeam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-05T16:30:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T16:30:49Z","body":"@ncw Can you check the commit above?
