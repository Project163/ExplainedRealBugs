Intro\r\n\r\nThe bisync pull request #5164 appeared too large to fulfil in a single rclone release.\r\n\r\nPlan is to merge it right after the rclone v1.57 release. The command will be available in the beta builds for a limited circle of beta testers until official release with rclone v1.58.\r\nDuring the beta period we can merge a number of postponed items, **in particular breaking changes**.\r\n\r\nThis ticket will keep track of the most beta time changes. Large and critical changes will be split into separate tickets.\nHigh priority items reflect changes breaking user experience and must be completed before 1.58.

Path2 files that do not exist in Path1 will be copied to Path1, and the process will then sync the Path1 tree to Path2.\r\n\r\nIn terms of how to refer to your remote, this notice explained it pretty well:\r\n\r\n> NOTICE: \"google-drive-remote\" refers to a local folder, use \"google-drive-remote:\" to refer to your remote or \"./google-drive-remote\" to hide this warning\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, we can use the following command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ rclone bisync google-drive-remote: ~/google-drive/ --resync --drive-acknowledge-abuse\r\n# Wait for it to finish...\r\n2023/05/08 14:24:54 INFO  : Bisync successful\r\n2023/05/08 14:24:54 INFO  : \r\nTransferred:   \t   31.500 KiB / 31.500 KiB, 100%, 117 B/s, ETA 0s\r\nChecks:              6411 / 6411, 100%\r\nTransferred:            1 / 1, 100%\r\nElapsed time:      6m39.8s\r\n\r\n\r\n# If it fails, ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# we can double-check what it will do on resync with a dry-run and then do a `--resync` again\r\n$ rclone bisync google-drive-remote: ~/google-drive/ --resync --drive-acknowledge-abuse --dry-run --verbose\r\n# Inspect the output to make sure it's doing sane things\r\n$ rclone bisync google-drive-remote: ~/google-drive/ --resync --drive-acknowledge-abuse\r\n# Wait for it to finish...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Automatically run the sync periodically/regularly\r\n\r\nThen we need to setup a scheduled task to run the sync periodically. We're going to be using a `systemd` timer instead of a cron for a [variety of benefits](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30638499).\r\n\r\n 1. First create the service and timer unit files:\r\n    `/etc/systemd/system/eric-rclone-bisync.service`\r\n    ```\r\n    [Unit]\r\n    Description=Run rclone bisync to sync Eric's Google Drive\r\n    \r\n    [Service]\r\n    User=eric\r\n    Group=eric\r\n    ExecStart=rclone bisync google-drive-remote: ~/google-drive/ --drive-acknowledge-abuse\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    `/etc/systemd/system/eric-rclone-bisync.timer`\r\n    ```\r\n    [Unit]\r\n    Description=rclone bisync service timer\r\n    \r\n    [Timer]\r\n    OnBootSec=0min\r\n    # Run every 6 hours\r\n    OnCalendar=*-*-* */6:00:00\r\n    Unit=eric-rclone-bisync.service\r\n    \r\n    [Install]\r\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\r\n    ```\r\n 1. Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to make `systemd` aware of the new files (this makes `systemd` reload all files and re-consider their dependencies)\r\n 1. Enable the timer unit so the timer is enabled at boot every time: `sudo systemctl enable eric-rclone-bisync.timer`\r\n 1. To start the the timer unit immediately (without booting): `sudo systemctl start eric-rclone-bisync.timer`\r\n 1. To see the status of the timer and service: `sudo systemctl status eric-rclone-bisync.timer eric-rclone-bisync.service`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther references:\r\n\r\n - https://www.reddit.com/r/rclone/comments/v93mxu/comment/j6v3amf/\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\n\r\n### Unable to bisync Google Docs\r\n\r\nWhen trying to sync after `--resync`, a bunch of `Ignoring incorrect line`  for every file that then turns into `Path2 file not found in Path1` later.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5696","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MadLittleMods/linux-notes/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MadLittleMods/linux-notes/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1685269166","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5696#issuecomment-1685269166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5696","id":1685269166,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5kcyqu","user":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-20T12:14:20Z","updated_at":"2023-08-20T12:14:20Z","body":"> The problem comes up if we attempt to upload a modified exported document, with the same name,\r\nback to Google Drive: \"Failed to copy: can't update a google document\". Similarly, deleting the\r\nlocal copy and then rclone syncing local to Drive: results in \"Couldn't delete: can't delete a google\r\ndocument\".\r\n\r\nThis appears to no longer be true. It looks like the quoted comment is from 2018, and a few months later Rclone [greatly improved](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/1#issuecomment-417935785) its handling of Google Docs, but the Bisync code was never updated to reflect this new reality (even despite being translated in 2021, after these changes). \r\n\r\nSo, it looks to me like all we really need to do here is remove the code that was added to detect and skip Google Docs, and just let Rclone handle them the same way it would for `sync`. (A quick test on my end seems to confirm this, but I want to test further and just make sure I'm not missing something.)\r\n\r\nThat said, I will still personally be keeping `--drive-skip-gdocs` on all my Bisync runs, as I'm not keen to have my Google Docs overwritten by local `.docx` versions, nor do I want my actual `.docx` files converted to Google Docs. But it should be supportable for people who do 😃 \r\n\r\nAlso, when we fix #5683 and #5684 we'll have to handle this case with special care...

Would you be interested in helping to beta-test it and give feedback?\r\n\r\n> Also a bit unrelated… If I understood correctly it is already possible to convert Google Doc files to links. But this still creates a syncing issue as rclone then also copies those links to Google Drive.\r\n\r\nI think you're referring to the `--drive-export-formats=url` option, right? If so, I think for the most part this should already work how you want it to, with some important caveats I'll explain below. For example, if you currently run the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone sync drive:somefolder local/somefolder --drive-export-formats=url\r\nrclone sync local/somefolder drive:somefolder --drive-export-formats=url\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe `.url` files will be created locally during the first command, and not duplicated in drive during the second command (because rclone finds a gdoc with the same name and understands they are the same file). Where you do have to be careful is if you manually create/rename a `.url` file on the local side, because if you sync with local as the source and then rclone doesn't find a matching gdoc on the drive side, it won't know what you want it to do -- so in that scenario it would copy the literal `.url` file to drive.\r\n\r\nAs far as bisync is concerned, my proposed fix essentially just lifts the current bisync-specific restrictions on google docs and allows rclone to handle them the same way it would in `sync`. This means that `--drive-export-formats=url` should also work as expected (just be sure to only create/edit/rename your google docs on the google drive side, because of the above.)\r\n\r\n> Also I think it is possible via Chrome's API to download all Google Doc files into web storage. If you edit files there Chrome should automatically take care of synchronization. So only thing rclone would have to do is convert Google Docs into links that open that specific file from web storage. I think this would be a more elegant solution than converting Google Docs into completely different formats.\r\n\r\nThat is an interesting idea. Since it affects the `drive` backend as a whole (not just bisync), I would suggest opening a new issue to request and discuss it further.
