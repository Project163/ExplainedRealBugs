I'm sorry if it ends up being messy.\r\n\r\nThat would be great :-)  Here are some hints\r\n\r\nWhat you'll have to do...\r\n- write a parser for the output of `df`\r\n- write a unit test for that\r\n- Implement About - this could should call `df` and parse the output\r\n\r\nOpen questions\r\n- should `df` be called with a parameter? I think so but I'm not sure exactly what! Maybe `df root` where root is the defined `f.root`.\r\n- should `df` be called with any flags? We need to be careful with cross platform stuff here... Note that GNU df outputs in 1k blocks but POSIX df outputs in blocks of 512... So it might be nice to collect some examples from Linux/MacOS/FreeBSD for the unit tests.\r\n- Should we detect whether df is available (like we do for md5sum/sha1sum) at Fs initialisation then remove the About call?\r\n\r\nUse this bit of code as a guide for calling `df` and getting the output\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/aba15f11d85dbb0b137f4b9f8d009d4c6fd7e47a/backend/sftp/sftp.go#L866-L881\r\n\r\nAnd here is an implemention of `About` for you to look

#3107\r\nThis adds support for using about with SFTP remotes.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this does not check to ensure that it is possible to invoke `df`. Should this be added, and if so, when should the check occur?\r\n\r\nThe `-k` flag in `df -k` should ensure even non-GNU `df` returns with 1k-blocks.\r\n\r\nI've tested this on my Ubuntu Linux server. It still needs to be tested on other platforms.\r\n\r\nAlso, for some reason, [my Travis build](https://travis-ci.com/gary-kim/rclone/builds/108866098) is passing but the one here is not?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone!
