Inspecting `multiThreadCopy()` in `fs/operations/multithread.go`, we see that `concurrency` is set to the lesser of itself and `numChunks`, then it is set to the greater of itself and the backend concurrency:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tnumChunks := calculateNumChunks(src.Size(), info.ChunkSize)\r\n\tif concurrency > numChunks {\r\n\t\tfs.Debugf(src, \"multi-thread copy: number of streams %d was bigger than number of chunks %d\", concurrency, numChunks)\r\n\t\tconcurrency = numChunks\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Use the backend concurrency if it is higher than --multi-thread-streams or if --multi-thread-streams wasn't set explicitly\r\n\tif !ci.MultiThreadSet || info.Concurrency > concurrency {\r\n\t\tfs.Debugf(src, \"multi-thread copy: using backend concurrency of %d instead of --multi-thread-streams %d\", info.Concurrency, concurrency)\r\n\t\tconcurrency = info.Concurrency\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe these two sections should be reversed, so that concurrency can never exceed the number of chunks:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\t// Use the backend concurrency if it is higher than --multi-thread-streams or if --multi-thread-streams wasn't set explicitly\r\n\tif !ci.MultiThreadSet || info.Concurrency > concurrency {\r\n\t\tfs.Debugf(src, \"multi-thread copy: using backend concurrency of %d instead of --multi-thread-streams %d\", info.Concurrency, concurrency)\r\n\t\tconcurrency = info.Concurrency\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tnumChunks := calculateNumChunks(src.Size(), info.ChunkSize)\r\n\tif concurrency > numChunks {\r\n\t\tfs.Debugf(src, \"multi-thread copy: number of streams %d was bigger than number of chunks %d\", concurrency, numChunks)\r\n\t\tconcurrency = numChunks\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.64.0\r\n- os/version: debian 11.7 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.10.0-23-amd64 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.21.1\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
