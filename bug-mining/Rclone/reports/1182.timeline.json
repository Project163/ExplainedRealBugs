you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nSeveral `bisync` bug fixes and new features including `--create-empty-src-dirs` and equality check.\r\nDescribed in (excruciating) detail [here](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636). And further articulated in the [proposed documentation changes](https://github.com/nielash/rclone/blob/256892d85c0f13934988bd64731e19e119836be5/docs/content/bisync.md).\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=1.%20Dry%20runs%20are%20not%20completely%20dry) causing dry runs to inadvertently commit filter changes\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=2.%20%2D%2Dresync%20deletes%20data%2C%20contrary%20to%20docs) causing `--resync` to erroneously delete empty folders and duplicate files unique to Path2\r\n* `--check-access` is now enforced during `--resync`, preventing data loss in [certain user error scenarios](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=%2D%2Dcheck%2Daccess%20doesn%27t%20always%20fail%20when%20it%20should)\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=5.%20Bisync%20reads%20files%20in%20excluded%20directories%20during%20delete%20operations) causing bisync to consider more files than necessary due to overbroad filters during delete operations\r\n* [Improved detection of false positive change conflicts](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=1.%20Identical%20files%20should%20be%20left%20alone%2C%20even%20if%20new/newer/changed%20on%20both%20sides) (identical files are now left alone instead of renamed)\r\n* Added [support for `--create-empty-src-dirs`](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=3.%20Bisync%20should%20create/delete%20empty%20directories%20as%20sync%20does%2C%20when%20%2D%2Dcreate%2Dempty%2Dsrc%2Ddirs%20is%20passed)\r\n* Added experimental `--resilient` mode to allow [recovery from self-correctable errors](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=2.%20Bisync%20should%20be%20more%20resilient%20to%20self%2Dcorrectable%20errors)\r\n* Added [new `--ignore-listing-checksum` flag](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=6.%20%2D%2Dignore%2Dchecksum%20should%20be%20split%20into%20two%20flags%20for%20separate%20purposes) to distinguish from `--ignore-checksum`\r\n* [Performance improvements](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=6.%20Deletes%20take%20several%20times%20longer%20than%20copies) for large remotes\r\n* Documentation and testing improvements\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes, mainly in this forum post:\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636\r\n\r\nIt also fixes #6109 and addresses several other open issues: #6841 #5683 #5681 #5676 #5675 #5674\r\n\r\n####
