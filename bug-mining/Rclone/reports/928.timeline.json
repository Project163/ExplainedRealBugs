think the algorithm can look like:\r\n- check whether self executable is writable by process user id (there may be windows specific tricks)\r\n- if not writable, ask to rerun as _root_ (Administrator)\r\n- parse https://downloads.rclone.org/version.txt\r\n- parse [https://downloads.rclone.org/[VERSION]/SHA1SUMS](https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.54.0/SHA1SUMS)\r\n- download architecture-compatible zip into `/tmp` from [https://downloads.rclone.org/[VERSION]/](https://downloads.rclone.org/v1.54.0)\r\n- validate hash\r\n- extract executable into self binary directory with temporary suffix (not to `/tmp`, to ensure atomicity of name swap  below)\r\n- clone permissions from original to new binary, warn but continue in case of errors\r\n- atomically swap name (similar to `mv -f` on Unix, I expect trickery on Windows)\r\n\r\nWhat will NOT be implemented by this ticket:\r\n- any kind of `--stable`  vs `--edge` flag -- rclone site currently provides only one `version.txt` with single line and I don't want to introduce fragile version number heuristics\r\n- detection of whether current binary was installed directly, via package or via `install.sh` -- any such detection will be fragile, it will _not ease_ maintenance\r\n- `.deb`, `.rpm`, etc package install -- this ticket is only about binary, I want to keep things simple, do not duplicate `apt-get install` or `yum install`\r\n- auto self update -- it's probably enough to add `rclone self-update`  into unix cron, windows task scheduler, or whatever will be implemented by #3269\r\n- package repositories have their dedicated requests #136 #2153\r\n\r\nTodo: use reference ideas from:\r\n- https://github.com/restic/restic/blob/master/cmd/restic/cmd_self_update.go\r\n-
