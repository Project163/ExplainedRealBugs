For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone mount B2:jik-test ~/tmp/mnt &\r\n[1] 111847\r\n$ cd ~/tmp/mnt\r\n$ echo foo > foo.txt\r\n$ echo bar >| foo.txt\r\n$ rclone ls --b2-versions B2:jik-test\r\n        4 foo.txt\r\n        4 foo-v2021-04-13-183633-000.txt\r\n$ \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't quite have the correct behavior for dot-files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo foo > .bash_profile\r\n$ echo bar >| .bash_profile\r\n$ rclone ls --b2-versions B2:jik-test\r\n        4 .bash_profile\r\n        4 -v2021-04-13-183730-000.bash_profile\r\n        4 foo.txt\r\n        4 foo-v2021-04-13-183633-000.txt\r\n$ \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the file name starts with a period, then that period should not be considered the start of an extension.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone version\r\nrclone v1.56.0-beta.5398.964c3e073\r\n- os/version: ubuntu 21.04 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.10.0-14-generic (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.16.3\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nUbuntu 21.04 amd64\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
