Instead, an error is thrown:\r\n\r\n    DEBUG : : Sizes differ (src 32 vs dst 25)\r\n    ERROR : : Failed to copy: Error \"item_name_in_use\" (409): Item with the same name already exists\r\n\r\nThe command is something like:\r\n\r\n    rclone copy boxRemote:path1 boxRemote:path2\r\n\r\nwhere path2 is intended to have a copy of all files that exist in path1.\r\n\r\nThe first time this copy is called, everything works because there are no existing files of path1 in path2. However, if later, a file is updated in path1 and then the above copy command is attempted, this `item_name_in_use` error is thrown.\r\n\r\nThis is with rclone 1.48 on Ubuntu x64 16.04.\r\n\r\nI suspect this is not desired behavior, because the same types of copy commands work just fine if src is local instead of a box remote.","closed_by":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
