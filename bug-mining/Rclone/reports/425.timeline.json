tools like the the AWS S3 Console, S3 network drives / fuse filesystems and various other tools create \"directories\" on S3 by creating zero byte keys that end with a slash to emulate empty directories.\n\nrclone currently can't handle these keys, because it tries to treat them like a file instead of a directory and fails with an error if a local directory with the same name exist.\n\nInstead rclone should detect these keys and treat them like a directory.\n\nThe keys are easy to detect, because they always end with a slash and have a content-length of 0 bytes.\n\nHere's an example key listed with the python aws cli:\n\n```\naws s3api head-object --bucket bito-pim-images --key 'images/WebShop/ita_IT/'\n{\n    \"AcceptRanges\": \"bytes\",\n    \"ContentType\":

{}\n}\n```\n\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\n\nv1.33-DEV\n\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nmacOS 10.12.1\n\n> Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\n\ns3\n\n> The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\n`rclone sync --size-only --delete-after remote:tmp /tmp`\n\n> A log from the command with the `-v` flag (eg output from `rclone -v copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\n```\n2016/09/30 22:09:55 Local file system at /Volumes/EXT4TBA/images: Waiting for transfers to finish\n2016/09/30 22:09:55
