I am trying to use the functionality that was implemented in #4419  to set the root sync to the folder Id, as I already have the ID of the particular folder I want to sync.\r\n\r\nCurrently I cannot see a way to pass the \"drive-root-folder-id\" param via RC. Is this a possibility with the way that RClone has been structured?\r\n\r\nI suppose I could spin up rclone with a command but it would be much cleaner to communicate with it with the API, especially with the async job system.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAdd the ability to set global flags via the RC api.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
