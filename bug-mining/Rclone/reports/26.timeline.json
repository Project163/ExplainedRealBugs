How about re-wording like this?\n\n```\n    Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.  Doesn't transfer\n    unchanged files, testing first by modification time then by\n    size.  Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary.\n    Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run flag.\n```\n\nAs for versioning - I wasn't actually aware what rclone does created a version, but I've verified it does just now.  What it does (on google drive) is if the destination doesn't exist it creates it, but if it does then it updates it.  I guess this is causing the versions.  The [api docs for update](https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/files/update) don't state it makes a new version but it makes sense that it does.\n\nI can document that in the google drive

Yes, the reword covers it nicely.\n\nAbout versioning, it is documented under the \"newRevision\" parameter:\n\n> If true or not set, a new blob is created as head revision, and previous revisions are preserved  (causing increased use of the user's data storage quota).\n\nI must note, however, that the information on that API doc is incorrect: adding the version/revision does not increase the usage of the user's data storage quota. That would only happen if the \"pinned\" parameter is passed as \"true\" (it defaults to \"false\") of if the user manually enter the version management interface and ticked the \"Keep forever\" checkbox, as per [this link](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2490100?hl=en).\n\nThis could be an interesting addition to rclone: having the option to set the revisions as pinned by default. This would be particularly useful for Google Apps for Business with unlimited storage (Google Drive for Work or whatever they're calling it now). I might look into it in the future, though I probably won't have to time to do so until late May (specially since I don't know a thing about the Go language).\n\nIn case you're not familiar with the version control system on Google Drive, non pinned revisions are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first). These revisions do not count towards a user storage quota.\nPinned revisions are kept indefinitely, but they do count towards a user storage quota. A file can have a maximum of 200 pinned revisions.\n\nI was using a few alternative solutions before trying rclone (mainly a few forks of Grive), but whenever a file changed, it would delete the file on Google Drive and upload the new one. \nBy adding it as a revision,  if I find out that I made a mistake before the last sync, I can download specific older versions and roll back. This is a fairly useful feature.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/83038491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gustavorochakv","id":11430927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDMwOTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11430927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv","html_url":"https://github.com/gustavorochakv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gustavorochakv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":258322547,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjU4MzIyNTQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/258322547","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-18T16:11:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":258322548,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI1ODMyMjU0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/258322548","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-18T16:11:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/83107769","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/39#issuecomment-83107769","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/39","id":83107769,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTA3NzY5","user":{"login":"zeshanb","id":6672739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzI3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6672739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb","html_url":"https://github.com/zeshanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeshanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-18T18:17:52Z","updated_at":"2015-03-18T18:17:52Z","body":"Will
