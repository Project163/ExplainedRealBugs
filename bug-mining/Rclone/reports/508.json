bug as described in the title can be reproduced with the current repo version (with Graph) of code.\r\n\r\nThe direct cause of the bug is that when `size` is `0` in the function [`uploadMultipart`](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/backend/onedrive/onedrive.go#L1329), the upload for-loop is skipped. Therefore, `info` is `nil`. Then when `info` is dereferenced, there will be SEGV.\r\n\r\nGraph's multi-part upload API does not support 0-size files (`{\"error\":{\"code\":\"invalidRequest\",\"message\":\"The Content-Range header is missing or malformed.\"}}`). So to allow upload of empty files, we must use [single-part upload](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/api/driveitem_put_content). But the [problem](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/pull/2472#issuecomment-414108942) with single-part upload is we'll either lose `modtime`, or create two versions of the same file. I think this needs to be discussed before changes can be made.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would prefer allowing single-part upload for empty files and setting `modtime` afterwards. Creating multiple versions of empty files won't occupy space, after all.\r\n\r\nI believe this bug is related to [this failure](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/pull/2472#issuecomment-417960848) and [this forum post](https://forum.rclone.org/t/onedrive-impersonation/6576/5).\r\n\r\nUpdate: The current code can download empty files without any problem.","closed_by":{"login":"Cnly","id":3103188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly","html_url":"https://github.com/Cnly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
