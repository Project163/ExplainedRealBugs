currently vendored version of `github.com/stretchr/testify` in the `rclone` repository is at commit https://github.com/stretchr/testify/commit/4d4bfba8f1d1027c4fdbe371823030df51419987 (2017-01-30).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, `github.com/stretchr/testify` has gained commit https://github.com/stretchr/testify/commit/46b3c8225b20f01377eeefe3e6b7b147bb742eff, which breaks your tests:\r\n```\r\n% go test github.com/ncw/rclone/fs       \r\n--- FAIL: TestSetDefaults (0.00s)             \r\n\tError Trace:\thttp_test.go:27\r\n\tError:      \tInvalid operation: (func(string,

ensure -update`) :)\r\n\r\nI noticed this when investigating why the Debian packaging for `rclone` fails to build (Debian’s `github.com/stretchr/testify` is more recent than your vendored version, and Debian un-vendors everything).","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1550/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
