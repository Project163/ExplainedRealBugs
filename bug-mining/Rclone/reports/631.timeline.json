has this concept of devices which are supposed to represent different instances of the official client. Mount points are specific to a device. We currently don't support this concept at all instead we use the \"Jotta\" device for all operations. The \"Jotta\" device is special and contains the Archive, Sync and Shared mount points visible in the Web UI but has no access to backup mount points of other devices. What is required here is proper support for different devices which I'd planned for a while but just haven't had the time to do yet.\r\n\r\nAlso I really couldn't think of an intuitive way the implement this when I initially wrote the Jottacloud client given the fact that both devices and mount points are can technically by the user and are almost (but not quite) like normal directories. Also I never used the official client so this hasn't been a priority to me

We switched to api.jottacloud.com to support resume of uploads. That's the only reason.\r\n\r\nMy gut feeling is the following, the upload to backup is only allowed for the same device. So, if you have the offical JottaClient doing backups for a certain device, this devices gets an unique client_id/client_secret similar to the new setup process in rclone. I assume that when you try to upload a file into a backup (directory) from a another client the backend will not allow this.\r\n\r\nSince Archive and Sync are suppose to be used from multiple client the upload/download from any client registered for the account works.\r\n\r\nYou might can try using an pre 1.4.6 version of rclone to play around which is not using the API endpoint at all or try to sniff the client_id / client_secret from the device your want to access the backups from.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/492981270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olihey","id":372454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey","html_url":"https://github.com/olihey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olihey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2345723205,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM0NTcyMzIwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2345723205","actor":{"login":"BartSiwek","id":1504709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDQ3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1504709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek","html_url":"https://github.com/BartSiwek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T08:57:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2345723208,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzNDU3MjMyMDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2345723208","actor":{"login":"BartSiwek","id":1504709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDQ3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1504709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek","html_url":"https://github.com/BartSiwek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BartSiwek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-16T08:57:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2348052183,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNDgwNTIxODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2348052183","actor":{"login":"buengese","id":4004974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDQ5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4004974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese","html_url":"https://github.com/buengese","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/buengese/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cfd491bfe8ad4833c0dad4703507b25ae96c7e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/buengese/rclone/commits/6cfd491bfe8ad4833c0dad4703507b25ae96c7e6","created_at":"2019-05-17T01:06:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":23496
