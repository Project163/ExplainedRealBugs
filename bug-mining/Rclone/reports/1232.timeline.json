Intro\r\n\r\nThe bisync pull request #5164 appeared too large to fulfil in a single rclone release.\r\n\r\nPlan is to merge it right after the rclone v1.57 release. The command will be available in the beta builds for a limited circle of beta testers until official release with rclone v1.58.\r\nDuring the beta period we can merge a number of postponed items, **in particular breaking changes**.\r\n\r\nThis ticket will keep track of the most beta time changes. Large and critical changes will be split into separate tickets.\nHigh priority items reflect changes breaking user experience and must be completed before 1.58. Medium priority items are required but not guaranteed by 1.58. Optional and low priority items will be implemented on best effort basis. Optional items don't even have dedicated tickets yet.\r\n\r\n### High priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Track critical flags in saved sessions - #5678\r\n- [ ] Support imprecise or absent modtimes - #5679\r\n- [ ] Use hashsums, honor `--checksum` - #5683\r\n\r\n### Medium priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check file sizes - #5684\r\n- [ ] Respect `--backup-dir` - #5685\r\n- [ ] Align `--max-delete` semantics - #5680\r\n- [ ] Optimize resync - #5681\r\n- [ ] Track renames - #5690\r\n\r\n### Low priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Handle deletion conflicts - #5691\r\n- [ ] Honor `--interactive` and `--auto-confirm`\r\n- [ ] Recover after transient failures - #5676\r\n- [ ] Use **trie** for listings to reduce footprint - #5686\r\n- [ ] Maintain session history - #5692\r\n- [ ] Handle Google Docs better - #5696\r\n\r\n### Optional items\r\n\r\n- [ ] Parallelize move/rename operations\r\n- [ ] Honor special `.rcignore` files\r\n- [ ] Revisit progress display for bisync\r\n- [ ] Handle case-insensitive filenames. Respect `--ignore-case` and `--ignore-case-sync` ([rcsync#54](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/54), [#4854](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4854))\r\n- [ ] Synchronize empty dirs if supported by backend ([rcsync#63](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/63))\r\n- [ ] Fix tests for Google Photos ([rcsync#53](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/53), [G.Photos issues](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Google+Photos%22))\r\n- [ ] Enable CI tests with OwnCloud (according to @cjnaz it's stable)\n- [ ] Test should handle Dropbox \"touch quirks\" in a generic way\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nSeveral `bisync` bug fixes and new features including `--create-empty-src-dirs` and equality check.\r\nDescribed in (excruciating) detail [here](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636). And further articulated in the [proposed documentation changes](https://github.com/nielash/rclone/blob/256892d85c0f13934988bd64731e19e119836be5/docs/content/bisync.md).\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=1.%20Dry%20runs%20are%20not%20completely%20dry) causing dry runs to inadvertently commit filter changes\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=2.%20%2D%2Dresync%20deletes%20data%2C%20contrary%20to%20docs) causing `--resync` to erroneously delete empty folders and duplicate files unique to Path2\r\n* `--check-access` is now enforced during `--resync`, preventing data loss in [certain user error scenarios](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=%2D%2Dcheck%2Daccess%20doesn%27t%20always%20fail%20when%20it%20should)\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=5.%20Bisync%20reads%20files%20in%20excluded%20directories%20during%20delete%20operations) causing bisync to consider more files than necessary due to overbroad filters during delete operations\r\n* [Improved detection of false positive change

(identical files are now left alone instead of renamed)\r\n* Added [support for `--create-empty-src-dirs`](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=3.%20Bisync%20should%20create/delete%20empty%20directories%20as%20sync%20does%2C%20when%20%2D%2Dcreate%2Dempty%2Dsrc%2Ddirs%20is%20passed)\r\n* Added experimental `--resilient` mode to allow [recovery from self-correctable errors](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=2.%20Bisync%20should%20be%20more%20resilient%20to%20self%2Dcorrectable%20errors)\r\n* Added [new `--ignore-listing-checksum` flag](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=6.%20%2D%2Dignore%2Dchecksum%20should%20be%20split%20into%20two%20flags%20for%20separate%20purposes) to distinguish from `--ignore-checksum`\r\n* [Performance improvements](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=6.%20Deletes%20take%20several%20times%20longer%20than%20copies) for large remotes\r\n* Documentation and testing improvements\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes, mainly in this forum post:\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636\r\n\r\nIt also fixes #6109 and addresses several other open issues: #6841 #5683 #5681 #5676 #5675 #5674\r\n\r\n####

had the same thought recently:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/156c372cd760460f419708c75506434c48decfc8/cmd/bisync/operations.go#L426-L433\r\n\r\nI tend to think it would be better to change it, as in addition to being simpler and more symmetrical, it would also make `--resync` substantially faster for users of `--create-empty-src-dirs`. However, it would be a breaking change, and I'm not sure how concerned we should be about that. It's possible that some users have come to depend on the asymmetry in some way. For instance, imagine a scenario where you're bisyncing one central server with multiple devices, and the server is the source-of-truth. The asymmetry allows you to declare that the server should take priority in the event of a `--resync`, even if the corresponding file on the other path is newer.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best compromise is to make the behavior configurable with a flag?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1685551683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10280825685,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAQ-n5M483tnIzwAAAAJkyPNV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10280825685","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-05T08:52:11Z","label":{"name":"needs

this is likely when resync is run when data is already present vs copying the data itself.. There are no changes made to files when moving between a --resync and normal run.  \r\n\r\ndefaults:\r\n\tresync: 10m47.0s\r\n\tnormal: 6m44.7s\r\n\r\ndefaults with ignore checksum: (--ignore-listing-checksum --ignore-checksum)\r\n\tresync: 10m36.5s\r\n\tnormal: 6m31.9s\r\n\r\n### overview\r\n\r\nSo as you can see bisync is orders of magnitude slower than `copy` or `sync` . `ls` is incredibly fast as is `sync` and `copy` in both directions (e.g. uses up almost 100% of bandwidth)\r\n\r\nI only ran the test of `lsl` and `ls` at the very end and now thinking that bisync relies on lsl as this so incredibly slow (as I believe bisync does not use checksum so would need `lsl` info to compare?).\r\n\r\nI can do a local to crypt (local) bisync in 15s (--resync) and 8.7s for subsequent. \r\n\r\nIs there something I am doing wrong? If not, are there plans/options available to rclone to improve the speed of bisync so that it is more in line with 2 x sync/copy commands (e.g. one upload, one download) or is this a limitation that is unlikely to be overcome? Also, if this is due to lsl taking so long is there a way to speed up lsl? \r\n\r\nThanks to you all for your hard work and a special thank you @nielash for all you've been doing on bisync and continue to do. I as many others massively appreciate it and when this tool is out of experimental stages it will be a game changer for so many. If I had any free time or money right now I would help out but unfortunately the best I can do is give you some benchmarks and user feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1741029638","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5681#issuecomment-1741029638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5681","id":1741029638,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5nxgEG","user":{"login":"crocinsocks","id":88002608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDAyNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88002608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks","html_url":"https://github.com/crocinsocks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crocinsocks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-29T14:59:02Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T14:59:02Z","body":"@nielash I've moved my comments over from #7332 regarding bisync.. \r\n\r\nI agree with both @ivandeex  @cjnaz that the correct implementation for bisync should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone copy --update Path1 Path2 (--create-empty-src-dirs)\r\nrclone copy --update Path2 Path1 (--create-empty-src-dirs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what would happen if I was using Dropbox, OneDrive, GDrive, etc (e.g. the newest file will always survive on init and where the local directory already has data). \r\n\r\nAs bisync is still experimental I seem no harm in changing this to be the default behavior. Also, I believe this would be inline with the expectations of any new users of bisync and would also benefit existing users. \r\n\r\nThis also makes a --resync far less destructive. Currently, Path1 will always take precedent which is the last thing I believe anyone would want from a bisync (existing or new users) rather they are stuck with the current implementation. If there are current users that would like this functionality perhaps either a --legacy flag or simply they can run a sync manually to have the desired effect based of your comments:

I agree with both @ivandeex @cjnaz that the correct implementation for bisync should be:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> rclone copy --update Path1 Path2 (--create-empty-src-dirs)\r\n> rclone copy --update Path2 Path1 (--create-empty-src-dirs)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI generally agree as well, although I have a slight concern about the use of `--update` for the same reasons articulated in [our other thread](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7332#issuecomment-1741611077), about the potential dangers of picking winners and losers at the _file_ level instead of the _filesystem_ level. But I think this could be solved by just letting the user choose their desired behavior with a flag.\r\n\r\n> This also makes a --resync far less destructive. Currently, Path1 will always take precedent which is the last thing I believe anyone would want from a bisync \r\n\r\nI can think of a few reasons a user might want the asymmetry -- I described one of them above. Imagine, for example, that I pull my dusty old laptop out of the closet which hasn't been synced in a long time, and I want to bring it up to date with my Google Drive which I know is totally up-to-date. In this case, I do in fact want the trusted `drive` side to take precedence over the untrusted `local` side -- even if certain `local` files happen to be newer (intentional reversions do sometimes happen -- maybe I restored something from a backup recently on the `drive` side, and now it's about to get overwritten.) An asymmetrical `--resync` lets you declare one side the source-of-truth; while `--update` prioritizes the newness of individual files, possibly at the expense of consistency at the directory-level.\r\n\r\nAnother use case (which I've used myself) is safer preservation of metadata that rclone doesn't currently support, such as directory metadata, macOS xattrs, and permissions. An asymmetrical sync allows you to avoid overwriting that stuff on the trusted side, when possible. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it should be noted that bisync's current approximation of `--ignore-existing` does have a performance benefit, because in 1 of the 2 directions it can skip the modtime (or checksum) check for some of the files. (But that performance benefit is negated if using `--create-empty-src-dirs`, which requires a third operation -- unless we change that.)\r\n\r\nI tend to think that rclone's default (which is still slightly asymmetrical) should be bisync's default:\r\n```\r\nrclone copy Path2 Path1 (--create-empty-src-dirs)\r\nrclone copy Path1 Path2 (--create-empty-src-dirs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that this should be overridable with flags for users who think this is madness 😄 \r\n\r\n@ncw I think this is ultimately a question for you -- what is your guiding principle for breaking changes such as this, where it's not exactly a bug, but there does seem to be consensus that a different way would be better? Is it ok to change the behavior, provided it's documented clearly? (And is the calculation different because bisync is still in beta?)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1741616588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10516219773,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M483tnIzwAAAAJy0Md9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10516219773","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-30T01:20:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10516219775,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M483tnIzwAAAAJy0Md_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10516219775","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-30T01:20:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10516219781,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M483tnIzwAAAAJy0MeF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10516219781","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-30T01:20:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10516219784,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M483tnIzwAAAAJy0MeI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10516219784","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_
