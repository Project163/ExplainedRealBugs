I have to run the command mkdir on the subdirectory before it can be purged.\n\nSecond issue, rclone try to delete container. It should not. Here's the output :\n\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:54 Attempt 1/3 failed with 2 errors and: Container Not Empty\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:54 Waiting for deletions to finish\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:55 Attempt 2/3 failed with 2 errors and: Container Not Empty\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:55 Waiting for deletions to finish\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:55 Attempt 3/3 failed with 2 errors and: Container Not Empty\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:55 Failed to purge: Container Not Empty\n\nEDIT: Those issues seem to be related to the way my Swift provider is managing directories. I get a third issue when using `./rclone sync swift:container/sub local`. Directories in sub are created as 0-byte-files (and I get errors for all files in those directories).\n\nRegards,\nAxtux\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/172/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
