When I run lsjson with -R and -L flag, rclone encounters an error when parsing these symlinks. Now theoretically, lsjson should log these error on console and keep walking the system (./a/d and ./a/d/3 should get walked). But what happens is rclone exits for this directory (./a and child dirs). It does complete the walk for other dirs.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.53.1\r\n\r\n    os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n    go version: go1.15\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux Ubuntu 20.04 64 bit.
