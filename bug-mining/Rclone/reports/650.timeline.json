found https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules helpful in explaining modules especially:\r\n> By default, go commands like go build ignore the vendor directory when in module mode.\r\nThe -mod=vendor flag (e.g., go build -mod=vendor) instructs the go commands to use the main module's top-level vendor directory to satisfy dependencies. The go commands in this mode therefore ignore the dependency descriptions in go.mod and assume that the vendor directory holds the correct copies of dependencies. Note that only the main module's top-level vendor directory is used; vendor directories in other locations are still ignored.\r\nSome people will want to routinely opt-in to vendoring by setting a GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor environment variable.\r\n\r\nwhich is why by default (from go 1.11) make downloads all the modules instead of relying on the vendor folder, if you want to change this add `GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor ` to the makefile\r\n\r\nalso from the faq:\r\n\r\n> Why does 'go mod tidy' record indirect and test dependencies in my 'go.mod'?\r\n> \r\n> The modules system records precise dependency requirements in your go.mod. (For more details, see the go.mod concepts section above or the go.mod tip documentation).\r\n> \r\n> go mod tidy updates your current go.mod to include the dependencies needed for tests in your module — if a test fails, we must know which dependencies were used in order to reproduce the failure.\r\n> \r\n> go mod tidy also ensures your current go.mod reflects the dependency requirements for all possible combinations of OS, architecture, and build tags (as described here). In contrast, other commands like go build and go test only update go.mod to provide the packages imported by the requested packages under the current GOOS, GOARCH, and build tags (which is one reason go mod tidy might add requirements that were not added by go build or similar).\r\n> \r\n> If a dependency of your module does not itself have a go.mod (e.g., because the dependency has not yet opted in to modules itself), or if its go.mod file is missing one or more of its dependencies (e.g., because the module author did not run go mod tidy), then the missing transitive dependencies will be added to your module's requirements, along with an // indirect comment to indicate that the dependency is not from a direct import within your module.\r\n>\r\n> Note that this also means that any missing test dependencies from your direct or indirect dependencies will also be recorded in your go.mod. (An example of when this is important: go test all runs the tests of all direct and indirect dependencies of your module, which is one way to validate that your current combination of versions work together. If a test fails in one of your dependencies when you run go test all, it is important to have a complete set of test dependency information recorded so that you have reproducible go test all behavior).\r\n> \r\n> Another reason you might have // indirect dependencies in your go.mod file is if you have upgraded (or downgraded) one of your indirect dependencies beyond what is required by your direct dependencies, such as if you ran go get -u or go get foo@1.2.3. The go tooling needs a place to record those new versions, and it does so in your go.mod file (and it does not reach down into your dependencies to modify their go.mod files).\r\n> \r\n> In general, the behaviors described above are part of how modules provide 100% reproducible builds and tests by recording precise dependency information.\r\n> \r\n> If you are curious as to why a particular module is showing up in your go.mod, you can run go mod why -m <module> to answer that question. Other useful tools for inspecting requirements and versions include go mod graph and go list -m all\r\n\r\nwhich is why `go get -u & go mod tidy` is not always the best.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/507809550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yparitcher","id":38916402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTE2NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38916402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher","html_url":"https://github.com/yparitcher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/508044107","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3317#issuecomment-508044107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3317","id":508044107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODA0NDEwNw==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T10:52:52Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T10:52:52Z","body":"> it works now,\r\n> sorry I meant [2d0e988](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/commit/2d0e9885bd78f23f0957f36a81b065afda2fc714) however on the github website it has a 246 next to it\r\n\r\nThanks - don't think I reviewed that pull request well enough!\r\n\r\nI think this was the root of the problem since I merged that after I last did `go mod tidy`.\r\n\r\nNote that after I rebuilt the vendor directory there were no files added, removed or changed by it, so I think this was entirely a go.sum problem caused by that PR.\r\n\r\nI'm attempting to have rclone buildable with and without modules.
