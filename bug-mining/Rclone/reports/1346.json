rclone [azureblob backend](https://rclone.org/azureblob/) currently offers serve side copies using the [Copy Blob API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/copy-blob). This copies blobs in a single threaded way on the server. Rclone has to poll the server for completion. It turns out this API is quite slow and doesn't scale well. This causes rclone to be much slower than azcopy for some copies.\r\n\r\nThis API was superseded by the [PutBlockFromURL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-from-url) / [PutBlockList](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list) APIs. This API was introduced in 2018-03-28 which was after the rclone azureblob backend was created in 2017-07-25!\r\n\r\nUpdating to using this API would allow rclone to do the server side copy in chunks - as a multi-part server side copy - and most importantly allow these chunks to run in parallel. This is used by [AzCopy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy) and other tools.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
