you indicated in the following [thread](https://forum.rclone.org/t/server-side-copy-sync-between-team-drives/7128/6?u=espiman), I open a new case.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to server side copy/synchronize 2 team drives or 1 team drive with 1 drive?\r\n\r\nWith 2 drive accounts it is possible using the same remote in source and target, with the target being a shared folder of the other drive account:\r\n\r\nrclone copy drive1:/data drive1:/sharedFolderInDrive2 …\r\n\r\nI currently use the Air Explorer tool and it allows to do it.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDiego\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2728/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
