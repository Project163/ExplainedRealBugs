Upload the rclone Release-Signing PGP key onto multiple domains,\r\n2. Document how a user can verify the rclone Release-Signing PGP key from multiple domains out-of-band when importing the key to their keyring for the first time (TOFU), and\r\n3. Document how a user can verify the authenticity of an rclone release after download and before installing it\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nIt's possible for a very powerful adversary to comprimise your release infrastructure (or the infrastructure between the server and the client) and get a new rclone user to download a malicious version of the release, signature, and the release signing key -- but it's exponentially more difficult for them to comprimise multiple distinct domains.\r\n\r\nHere's a great list of historically relevant cases where this has already happened to other open-source projects:\r\n\r\n * https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/main/supply-chain-security/compromises\r\n\r\nThis risk can nearly be completely eliminated by uploading your key to as many distinct domains as possible.\r\n\r\n# Part One: Making key available out-of-band\r\n\r\n## GitHub\r\n\r\nPlease upload your public key to some connoncial URL of one of your github repos. I'd suggest using a `KEYS` file in the root of your `rclone` repo, per the Apache standard\r\n\r\n * https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/KEYS\r\n * https://infra.apache.org/release-signing#keys-policy\r\n\r\n## rclone.org\r\n\r\nPlease upload your public key to some permalink on your website. `/KEYS` or `/key.txt` would be a reasonable location.\r\n\r\n * https://rclone.org/KEYS\r\n * https://rclone.org/key.txt\r\n * https://megous.com/key.txt\r\n\r\n## craig-wood.com\r\n\r\n * https://www.craig-wood.com/nick/KEYS\r\n * https://www.craig-wood.com/nick/key.txt\r\n\r\n## SKS Keyservers\r\n\r\nPlease upload your key to an SKS keyserver. For example:\r\n\r\n * https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/\r\n \r\n## https://keys.openpgp.org/\r\n\r\nkeys.openpgp.org is a newer keyserver that doesn't sync with the others, and it strips UIDs and signatures by default for privacy and to resist [certificate spamming attacks](https://tech.michaelaltfield.net/2019/07/14/mitigating-poisoned-pgp-certificates/)\r\n\r\nPlease upload your PGP key to keys.openpgp.org\r\n\r\n * https://keys.openpgp.org/\r\n\r\n## Twitter\r\n\r\nPlease add your public keys' full fingerprint to the account description of your twitter account \r\n\r\n * https://twitter.com/njcw\r\n\r\n## reddit\r\n\r\nPlease add your public keys' full fingerprint to the sidebar of your subreddit:\r\n\r\n * https://old.reddit.com/r/rclone/\r\n\r\n## Other domains\r\n\r\nI do recommend adding your key to as many other domains as possible, including:\r\n\r\n1. Mastodon\r\n2. Your official [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) account\r\n4. Any domains you own\r\n5. DNS [TXT Record](https://github.com/feather-wallet/feather/issues/42#issuecomment-1385685995)\r\n6. Something else?\r\n\r\nThe more domains you upload it to, the better.\r\n\r\n# Part Two & Three: Documenting it\r\n\r\nAfter uploading your public key and/or full fingerprint to as many distinct domains as possible, please update the project's documentation to enumerate all of these locations and write a paragraph describing how the user can mitigate the risk of compromised infrastructure by cross-checking the integrity of the key across multiple domains.\r\n\r\n * https://rclone.org/downloads/\r\n * https://rclone.org/install/\r\n\r\nThe above pages should also document how a user can use GPG to verify that a given release is cryptographically authentic after downloading it.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
