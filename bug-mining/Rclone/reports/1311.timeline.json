The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\n\n(Not posted to forum yet)\n\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\n\nAfter updating from rclone v1.69.2 to v1.70.1 on EndeavourOS (Arch Linux), uploads to PikPak stopped working. Every upload fails with an S3-related error about aws-chunked encoding not being supported with the specified x-amz-content-sha256 value. \n\nThis appears to be a regression introduced in the new version as uploads were working fine with v1.69.2. To confirm this, I installed v1.69.2 on one of my servers, tried the same upload there and  it worked without any issues.\n\n#### What is your rclone version\n\n```\nrclone v1.70.1\n- os/version: endeavouros (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 6.15.3-arch1-1 (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.24.4\n- go/linking: dynamic\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nEndeavourOS (Arch Linux), 64 bit\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\n\nPikPak\n\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\n```\nrclone copy /home/username/Videos/test.mp4 pikpak:/test/ --stats-one-line -P -vv\n```\n\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag \n\n```\nrclone copy /home/username/Videos/test.mp4 pikpak:/test/ --stats-one-line -P -vv\n2025/06/22 06:30:23 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.70.1\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"/home/username/Videos/test.mp4\" \"pikpak:/test/\" \"--stats-one-line\" \"-P\" \"-vv\"]\n2025/06/22 06:30:23 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/home/username/Videos/test.mp4\"\n2025/06/22 06:30:23 DEBUG : Using config file from \"/home/username/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\"\n2025/06/22 06:30:23 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming child cache item \"/home/username/Videos/test.mp4\" to be canonical for parent \"/home/username/Videos/PikPak/Error\"\n2025/06/22 06:30:23 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"pikpak:/test/\"\n2025/06/22 06:30:25 DEBUG : Saving config \"captcha_token\" in section \"pikpak\" of the config file\n2025/06/22 06:30:28 DEBUG : fs cache: renaming cache item \"pikpak:/test/\" to be canonical \"pikpak:test\"\n2025/06/22 06:30:28 DEBUG : test.mp4: Need to transfer -
