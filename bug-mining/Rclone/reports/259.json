the RClone update of v1.33, I want to start using the `crypt` provider for nearly all of my `rclone` uses, but I want to keep the names of my RClone providers the same (I.E. `ACUS` or `OneDrive`), this means I have to rename my existing providers and make new `crypt` providers with the existing names to point at them.\n\nMaybe I'm blind, but I can't find any documentation on how to do that using `rclone config`, without editing `%USERPROFILE%\\.rclone.conf` (Which personally I think is a poor place to put a config file, instead of `%APPDATA%\\rclone\\rclone.conf`, but that's another issue entirely).\n\nIs there a way to do this using the `rclone` interface, without deleting and reauthorizing all of my providers again?\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
