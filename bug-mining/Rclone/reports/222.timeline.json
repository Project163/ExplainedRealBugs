Here is an explanation of what those are: http://superuser.com/questions/298785/icon-file-on-os-x-desktop/298798\n\nBackblaze (nor any other cloud provider) don't let you store a file with a control character in which is why they don't upload and why so many errors.\n\nI think if it wasn't for those files then your sync would be working quite well.  There are always a few errors with cloud storage systems, but rclone will retry the sync and get there in the end.\n\nSo I think what I should do is substitute control characters (0x00-0x1F and 0x7F) in local.go `cleanRemote` (perhaps to %XX) this will make the sync complete properly.  Note that it won't back up the contents of the Icon files though as these are stored in the resource fork and rclone only copies the data fork.\n\nI'll post a beta for you to try in due course here.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/245429817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":781591104,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDc4MTU5MTEwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/781591104","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-07T21:47:02Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":781591105,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDc4MTU5MTEwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/781591105","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-07T21:47:02Z","label":{"name":"Remote:

What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\nrclone v1.34-03-g34e7ca9β\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nDebian 8\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using?

As of the latest beta, rclone no longer supports them and prints the above message, then proceeds to delete the files from Amazon Cloud Drive.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that the files were successfully stored by v1.33, as the delete message from v1.34beta is \"corrupted\", e.g.\r\n\": Deletedarie/2/Icon\"\r\nWhat happened is the filename printed, and when it hit the /r at the end of \"Icon/r\" it reset the position to the start of the line - and then the \": Deleted\" text overwrote beginning of the line. If the \"\\r\" hadn't been stored on ACD, then the deletion wouldn't have that carriage return in the middle. So it looks like at least some cloud services support some control characters.\r\n\r\nHonestly, it's not a big deal if these aren't backed up - it's a corner case for sure and control characters in filenames are evil. However, it's worth noting that there's at least one semi-useful case for them (Icon\\r, and the related ._Icon\\r when saved on foreign filesystems) and Amazon Cloud Drive at least stores them properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/861/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
