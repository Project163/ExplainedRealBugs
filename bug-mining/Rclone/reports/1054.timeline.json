> rclone should probably just ignore options starting with `_` - do you think that is correct?\r\n> \r\n> @ncw I don't know if it's correct. Could you point to something more official than q/a site?\r\n\r\nI looked at the mount source code for linux...\r\n\r\nI found `_netdev` defined here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/blob/cb49adb703b2a0b0cb4dcad0b985e186149ce65c/libmount/src/optmap.c#L168\r\n\r\nWhich looks like the mount conmmand names all the mount options and doesn't take shortcuts :-(\r\n\r\nI thought maybe we should just relax this check and allow options starting with `_` through. They will get passed to fusermount...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/4c93378f0e67fd65167abbd25e0b20d668102f1f/fs/mount_helper.go#L211-L213\r\n\r\nHowever that doesn't work for `cmount` at least\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./rclone -vv cmount -o _netdev s3:rclone /mnt/tmp/\r\n[snip]\r\nfuse: unknown option `_netdev'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I guess mount must filter out all the [user space mount options](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/blob/cb49adb703b2a0b0cb4dcad0b985e186149ce65c/libmount/src/optmap.c#L143) before passing them to fusermount as none of them seemed to work with fusermount directly, though I couldn't find out how/where this happens in the source.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose the minimal change would be to ignore `_netdev` in the options. We might consider some/all of the [user space mount options](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/blob/cb49adb703b2a0b0cb4dcad0b985e186149ce65c/libmount/src/optmap.c#L143)  too. That is putting more policy into rclone which is annoying, so keeping it to the minimum would be good!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/968984747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5618774647,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M4-rCTyzwAAAAFO57J3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5618774647","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-15T14:49:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5618774656,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M4-rCTyzwAAAAFO57KA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5618774656","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-15T14:49:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/969384461","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5808#issuecomment-969384461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5808","id":969384461,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M45x6IN","user":{"login":"swordfish90s","id":65988864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTg4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65988864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s","html_url":"https://github.com/swordfish90s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swordfish90s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-15T22:31:31Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T22:31:31Z","body":"Is
