you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis fixes #5078 by adding basic support for [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) requests when serving http-based protocols. This means that webapps are able to send requests to this server even if they are on a different domain. The main usecase of this is to support webapps that don't manage their own storage but instead delegate to a WebDAV server, e.g. https://organice.200ok.ch/ from the linked issue.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n- #5078 \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n  - not sure how to test this so I've left this\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6103/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1109809013","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5078#issuecomment-1109809013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5078","id":1109809013,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5CJld1","user":{"login":"Arnie97","id":10341686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQxNjg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10341686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97","html_url":"https://github.com/Arnie97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnie97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-26T13:37:29Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T13:37:29Z","body":"> via the `--headers` flag\r\n\r\n> this method won't work for the serve command since that uses its own http handler which doesn't have support for adding custom headers\r\n\r\nHere I propose a new flag that takes care of headers in HTTP server responses, just like what `--headers` did for HTTP client requests.

this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n\r\n~~**Help wanted for this PR:** I am not sure how to update the auto-generated documentation. This PR removed `--rc-allow-origin` option and added new `{prefix}-allow-origin` option ([source code](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/46e155ae0c4d7c667267bc2a4b49040c1eb44a65/lib/http/server.go#L126)). So the usage of `--rc-allow-origin` is not changed. I don't know if I need to update the documentation of this part. And this `{prefix}-allow-origin` also apply to `rclone serve http` and I don't know if I need to update this part.~~\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nI tried to run `make doc` and found everything is generated correctly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7089/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"alensiljak","id":462445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjQ0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/462445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak","html_url":"https://github.com/alensiljak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-02T12:37:21Z","updated_at":"2023-07-02T12:37:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/newhinton/Round-Sync/issues/115","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/newhinton/Round-Sync","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/newhinton/Round-Sync/issues/115/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/newhinton/Round-Sync/issues/115/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/newhinton/Round-Sync/issues/115/events","html_url":"https://github.com/newhinton/Round-Sync/issues/115","id":1784620266,"node_id":"I_kwDOEM-B5c5qXyTq","number":115,"title":"Enable CORS on Serve (WebDAV)","user":{"login":"alensiljak","id":462445,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjQ0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/462445?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak","html_url":"https://github.com/alensiljak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alensiljak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2023-07-02T12:37:20Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T11:20:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":282034661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODIwMzQ2NjE=","name":"Round-Sync","full_name":"newhinton/Round-Sync","private":false,"owner":{"login":"newhinton","id":25279821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mjc5ODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25279821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton","html_url":"https://github.com/newhinton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newhinton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/newhinton/Round-Sync","description":"An android cloud file manager, powered by rclone.
