agree this could and should be improved!\r\n\r\n(For others reading this: [here's our previous discussion](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7332#issuecomment-1732881448) about it, with some good background info about why this is a particularly tough challenge for bisync.)\r\n\r\nSome possible solution approaches include:\r\n\r\n- \"autosave\" -- save progress state every X seconds (or after every X transfers) throughout a run, so in the event of a crash, the next run can resume from the last autosave. \r\nPros: probably the most accurate method\r\nCons: may be complicated to build, may slow down the sync with lots of writes to disk, may not be practical with a non-local `--workdir` if that is eventually supported\r\n\r\n- \"replay queues\" -- save the queue list at the beginning of each sync, and in the event of an interruption, the next run attempts to finish the prior run by \"replaying\" it, before starting the new run.\r\nPros: easier and less expensive than \"autosave\"\r\nCons: potentially not robust to changes that occurred after the interrupted run\r\n\r\n- \"graceful shutdown\" -- upon receiving Ctrl+C, gracefully wrap up what we're doing at the earliest opportunity, cleaning up after ourselves to make things easy for next time.\r\nPros: relatively easy and clean\r\nCons: only works when we have some warning (won't help with powercut, sudden crash, etc.)\r\n\r\n- \"diff from last trusted listing\" -- similar idea to https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7410/commits/ef4b47a9824754824a05491c3d4c7a2ef97253d4, but revert the whole listing instead of individual files, and re-diff.\r\nPros: the easiest and perhaps most elegant option\r\nCons: there's [one particular edge case](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7332#:~:text=the%20one%20scenario,and%20move%20on.%22) it wouldn't handle as well as the others (not sure how important that is)\r\n\r\nOne question I have for you is: how important is it to handle the \"crash\" scenarios in addition to the ones where we have some warning? i.e. would a \"graceful shutdown\" option go far enough for you?\r\n\r\nAnother use case to keep in mind here is using a laptop while traveling, and losing internet or needing to close the laptop mid-sync...","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1832979436/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11103287696,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M54P26FzwAAAAKVzrmQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/11103287696","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-30T01:53:55Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11103287702,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M54P26FzwAAAAKVzrmW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/11103287702","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-30T01:53:55Z","label":{"name":"thinking","color":"e9d6d5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11103287706,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M54P26FzwAAAAKVzrma","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/11103287706","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-30T01:53:55Z","label":{"name":"bisync","color":"1D76DB"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11103287714,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M54P26FzwAAAAKVzrmi","u

is a proposal for a new bisync feature to optionally auto-resolve sync conflicts (and customize bisync's change detection behavior more generally), inspired in part by discussions with @crocinsocks on #7332 and #5681.\r\n\r\n### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nCurrently, when a file is new/changed on both paths (relative to the prior sync), and the versions on each side are not identical, bisync will keep both versions, renaming them with `..path1` and `..path2` suffixes, respectively. Many users have requested more control over how bisync handles such conflicts -- including an option to automatically select one version as the \"winner\" and rename or delete the \"loser\".\r\n\r\nSimilarly, users have requested more control over how conflicting files are handled during `--resync`. Currently the `path1` version prevails by default, but users have requested options to automatically select the winner based on characteristics such as `newer`, `older`, `larger`, and `smaller`.\r\n\r\nSome users have additionally requested the ability to use the above-described auto-resolve features _as an alternative to needing `--resync` at all._ In other words, in an error scenario where bisync would otherwise demand a manual `--resync` to recover, this option would tell bisync to **automatically** run a `--resync` and auto-resolve any conflicts according to the rules described above. Such an option would maximize resilience at the possible expense of perfection (for example, [deleted files could occasionally re-appear](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5681#:~:text=Bidirectional%20sync%20can,has%20suddenly%20reappeared%3F).) Because bisync takes an approach of \"safe by default\", such an option would be disabled by default, but made available to advanced users via a new flag.\r\n\r\n### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nI propose the following new options:\r\n```\r\n--auto-resolve CHOICE     Automatically resolve conflicts by preferring the version that is: \r\n                            newer | older | larger | smaller | path1 | path2 (default: none)\r\n--conflict-loser CHOICE   When --auto-resolve selects a winner, do this to the loser:\r\n                            delete | num | pathname (default: num)\r\n``` \r\nFor example, suppose there is a sync conflict of `file` and the version on Path1 is newer.\r\n\r\n- With `--auto-resolve newer`, `path2/file` is renamed to `path2/file..conflict1` (or, if that already exists, `path2/file..conflict2`, etc.) and copied to path1, and `path1/file` is copied to path2 (without renaming).\r\n- If `--conflict-loser pathname` is added, path2 version is renamed to `path2/file..path2` instead of `path2/file..conflict1` (overwriting any `path2/file..path2` that already exists.)\r\n- If `--conflict-loser delete` is added, path2 version is deleted instead of renamed.\r\n\r\nOptions specific to `--resync`:\r\n```\r\n--resync-prefer OPTION    During --resync only, prefer the version that is: newer | older | larger | smaller | path1 | path2 (default: path1)\r\n--auto-resync             If set, automatically run --resync to recover after critical errors. WARNING: only use if you are SURE you know what you are doing! (default: false)\r\n--max-lock DURATION       Consider lock files older than this to be \"expired\" (default: 1d if --auto-resync=true, otherwise 0 (never expire))\r\n```\r\n`--resync-prefer` and `--auto-resync` can be used together, and either one can also be used without the other.\r\n\r\n`--max-lock` is a compromise necessary to balance `--auto-resync` with [lock files](https://rclone.org/bisync/#lock-file). Otherwise, if `--auto-resync` always respected lock files, a single interrupted run would break `--auto-resync` forever. But if `--auto-resync` always _ignored_ lock files, it could start resyncing while a prior non-resync is still running. The implementation of `--max-lock` could possibly include a mechanism for alive runs to renew themselves periodically, to determine with more certainty whether a lock file was left by an interrupted run or one that is still running, just taking awhile.\r\n\r\nNote that the `newer` and `older` options require modtime support for both paths, and will be ignored if either remote lacks modtimes (or if the user has requested to ignore them with [`--checksum`](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5683) or [`--size-only`](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5684).) \r\n\r\nAn open question is what should happen when a winner can't be determined by the requested method. For example: `--auto-resolve newer` where the sizes differ but modtimes are identical. Probably the easiest would be to revert to the current behavior (keep both, do `..path1` / `..path2` rename), but I am open to other ideas!\r\n\r\n### Further thoughts\r\n\r\nBisync users tend to fall into one of two camps:\r\n\r\n- User A demands perfection every time. If Bisync is ever unsure of what to do, User A would prefer that Bisync stop and ask for help rather than take its best guess and continue.\r\n- User B wants to \"set it and forget it\", and values resilience above perfection. Often this user is syncing something like a movie collection which could be easily re-downloaded from the internet or backups if necessary, so total perfection isn't required, and sync conflicts may not be worth the time to resolve. User B prefers that Bisync take its best guess and continue, rather than stopping to bother them every time it has a question, or worse -- refusing to run again until it gets an answer.\r\n\r\nBisync in its current form is a great fit for User A, and likely to cause a bit of frustration to User B. The features discussed above are aimed at making both camps happy -- it is User A's way by default, but User B can make it behave their way by adding flags.\r\n\r\nFellow bisync users, feel free to comment here with any thoughts on the above! I'd love to consider any and all feedback before developing a proof-of-concept (which I hope to do shortly.)\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

File is deleted on Path1\r\n2. Delete is synced successfully during a run that later (ungracefully) aborts\r\n3. Same file is added back on Path2 before the next run (with same timestamp)\r\n\r\nWith the \"diff from last trusted listing\" method, it will look like the file should be deleted from Path2, when in fact it should be copied to Path1. (Note that if the timestamp is different in step 3, it arrives at the right answer because it's deleted vs. newer, not deleted vs. unchanged.) Again, kind of an edge case that probably wouldn't happen too often.\r\n\r\nTwo other things to track here:\r\n\r\n- we'll need to make some kind of change to lock files, for the same reasons discussed in #7471 (else one ungraceful shutdown would break `--resilient` forever)\r\n- I'm not currently sure if it's best to bundle this feature into `--resilient` or make a new flag. Reason being: `--resilient` is currently about _retrying_, which is a slight difference in kind from _recovering_. There may be some users who want the retrying features but are not comfortable with recovering due to risks like the edge case described above.\r\n\r\n> handle the edge case of conflicts as in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7471.\r\n\r\n#7471 definitely helps here, but unless you're using `--conflict-loser delete` it's still not ideal, as it's really a false conflict... if we had the correct state, we'd know that only one of the sides has changed (and the unchanged side should be overwritten, not renamed).\r\n\r\n> With graceful shutdown perhaps you could even resume file upload from where it was left off when files have not changed on either side (particularly useful for larger uploads).\r\n\r\nMany (most?) rclone backends don't support partial uploads, so it's probably not possible, but check out #87... if it is someday supported in `sync`, it will be supported in `bisync` too.

PR is dependent on #7410, #7497, and #7498 -- only 2 commits are new 🙂 )\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nBefore this change, bisync had no mechanism to gracefully cancel a sync early and exit in a clean state. Additionally, there was no way to recover on the next run -- any interruption at all would cause bisync to require a --resync, which made bisync more difficult to use as a scheduled background process. \r\n\r\nThis change introduces a \"Graceful Shutdown\" mode and --recover flag to robustly recover from even un-graceful shutdowns. Details are documented thoroughly in the commit messages, and [the docs](https://github.com/nielash/rclone/blob/bisync-recover/docs/content/bisync.md#--recover).\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n- #7470\r\n- #7332\r\n- [How to reduce need for bisync::resync?](https://forum.rclone.org/t/how-to-reduce-need-for-bisync-resync/31067)\r\n\r\n####
