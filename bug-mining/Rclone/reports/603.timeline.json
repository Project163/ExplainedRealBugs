Maybe I just used rclone for too long with the old behaviour but it seems bizarre to me.\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to make an issue about this myself, as I have a folder on the cloud with upwards of 800 folders (one per day for several years) and used to use include filters to pull down just a few files. Since d758e1908ee679948f0503cb6b961a4d67bc8491 it now recreates the entire folder structure (800+ folders and 5-6x as many subfolders) every time. It's... mildly annoying.\r\n\r\nSimply disabling the creation of empty directories whenusing  filters only creates a different problem: perhaps a user doesn't want to download any files but does want to duplicate a folder structure so it's easier to put files in the right place before uploading. Currently he can do so by excluding all files.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/451485006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wlerin","id":4543115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMxMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4543115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin","html_url":"https://github.com/wlerin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wlerin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/451933914","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2869#issuecomment-451933914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2869","id":451933914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MTkzMzkxNA==","user":{"login":"ishuah","id":321040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTA0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah","html_url":"https://github.com/ishuah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ishuah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-07T13:26:04Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T13:26:04Z","body":"This behavior has had a lot of conflicting views ever since I implemented it. #2629 is a request to have this feature on the `copyto` command.
