We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/how-to-check-mount-upload-progress-from-scripts/27396\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.57.0\r\n- os/version: ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.4.0-90-generic (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.17.2\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nI would like to query the VFS cache stats of rclone mount from scripts using rclone's remote control (rc) API. At the moment I have to parse rclone's output or logfile and examine the corresponding INFO messages such as `vfs cache: cleaned: objects 2 (was 2) in use 2, to upload 0, uploading 2, total size 76.831Mi (was 76.831Mi)`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nIt would be awesome to query these statistics via remote control, such as (arbitrary example, could also look a little bit different):\r\n```\r\nrclone rc vfscache/stats\r\n{\r\n  \"objects\": 10,\r\n  \"inUse\": 5,\r\n  \"toUpload\": 3,\r\n  \"uploading\": 2,\r\n  \"totalSize\": 131072\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add. It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\r\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
