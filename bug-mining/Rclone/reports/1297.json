Discussion [in that issue](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3254#issuecomment-501765997) indicates that rsync.net should be on the list of cloud providers.\r\n\r\nHowever when looking at the list of cloud providers today, there's no mention of rsync.net.\r\n\r\nHas something happened, or support been removed, etc?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nProxmox.
