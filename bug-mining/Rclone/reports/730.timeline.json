Mainly I was confused about how an error that only occurs with CreateFile has anything to do with moving files. I spent a while looking for the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN flag in the windows API in MoveFile &c. before realizing that go abstracts the os operations of file creation/read/write to flags. Your fix solves the problem by bypassing it, and it works well. Much appreciated.
