So great that I'm actually already in the middle of implementing it :-)\n\nHere is the proposal I made - comments welcome \n\n\n# Hash Filter\n\nThis proposal describes a new flag `--hash-filter` which is used to make a deterministic selection of a random subset of files.\n\nUses include:\n\n1. Running a big sync on multiple machines\n2. Checking a subset of files for bitrot\n\nThe flag takes two parameters expressed as a fraction, so `--hash-filter 1/3` for example. Here the `3` represents the total number of subsets of files and the `1` represents which subset to select. So `--hash-filter 1/3`, `--hash-filter 2/3` and `--hash-filter 3/3` will all select different non-overlapping subsets of files.\n\nNote that rclone will still have to traverse all directories to select these files.\n\nThe first parameter can be replaced with `@` to select a random subset of files. In the example above `--hash-filter @/3` means rclone will substitute the `@` for a random number between 1 and 3 inclusive. The `@` will be chosen and remain constant throughout the life of that set of filters, so any retries that are needed will use the same value.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2663646861/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16465857439,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M6qQO0YzwAAAAPVcQuf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/16465857439","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dfe1aacc29366289e308be1aa33cdea15455948b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/dfe1aacc29366289e308be1aa33cdea15455948b","created_at":"2025-02-25T18:08:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2684409855","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8400#issuecomment-2684409855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8400","id":2684409855,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6gANf_","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-26T09:30:35Z","updated_at":"2025-02-26T09:30:46Z","body":"@zackees
