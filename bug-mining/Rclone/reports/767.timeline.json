is just a quick question, I was wondering if there is a command or way to change who last modified a file on Google Drive without making another copy? Similar to how renaming a file changes who it was lost modified by.\r\n\r\nFor example if I'm using service accounts to copy lots of files I would like them to rather say \"modified by Sparon\" than \"modified by mfc--mm1234xxxxxw8e887xxxx\" etc.\r\n\r\nThis is more of a cosmetic personal OCD thing haha sorry it's a bit of a strange request.\r\n\r\nIf there's no such way then that's completely fine I'll just do some file renames.\r\n\r\nI'd also just like to say thanks for fixing #4018, the duplicate folders was bugging me

Even if i do a rclone copy with --fast-list flag enabled for the above remote , it skips files just like it does while rclone size .I have chosen rclone size to show bugged --fast-list because its quicker than reproducing with rclone copy","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
