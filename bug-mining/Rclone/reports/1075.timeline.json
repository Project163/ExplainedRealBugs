around with retries and timeouts but discovered a larger issue: looking at the api doc on this page: https://www.opendrive.com/api the endpoint we use for metadata finding `/folder/itembyname.json/{session_id}/{folder_id}` is supposed to only ever return `DirUpdateTime`. However, the actual response (sometimes) includes an additional undocumented field (`Files`) that rclone assumes exist for the purposes of validating an object Update. \r\n\r\nWhen running with a very small file I get the following response:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /api/v1/folder/itembyname.json/<session_id>/<folder_id>?name=<name> \r\n\r\n{\r\n\t\"DirUpdateTime\": \"\",\r\n\t\"Files\": [{\r\n\t\t\"FileId\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Name\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"GroupID\": 0,\r\n\t\t\"Extension\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Size\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Views\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Version\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Downloads\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"DateModified\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Access\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Link\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"DownloadLink\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"StreamingLink\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"TempStreamingLink\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"ThumbLink\": \"\",\r\n\t\t\"Encrypted\": 0,\r\n\t\t\"Password\": \"\",\r\n\t}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLarger files seem to take an arbitrary amount of time before they appear in the `itembyname` endpoint, but they DO exist, and can be seen by calling `/api/v1/file/info.json/<file_id>?session_id=<session_id>` immediately \r\n\r\nPatching `readMetaData` partially fixes the issue. Insert the following to fetch the object directly if you know the id before calling the other endpoint:\r\nhttps://github.com/scott-grimes/rclone/pull/1/files\r\n\r\nWith this patch in place I can now upload files consistently, and the logs also show hash checks which they did not before since no has was returned by the other endpoint 🎉 \r\n\r\nUnfortunately this introduces another problem: only files less than `chunksize` work when copying.

What is the purpose of this change?\r\nResolves two issues:\r\n1) fetches metadata directly from `/file/info.json` in readMetaData when possible (if the object id is already known)\r\n\r\nPreviously all calls in readMetaData relied on the `/folder/itembyname.json` api which is buggy: items written to a directory take an arbitrary amount of time to appear via this endpoint, and the file info returned does not include the file hash\r\n\r\n2) resolves an undocumented feature of the `move_copy` endpoint which silently truncates new filenames to 255 char. \r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5936\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution

What is the purpose of this change?\r\nResolves two issues with opendrive:\r\n1) fetches metadata directly from `/file/info.json` in readMetaData when possible (if the object id is already known)\r\n\r\nPreviously all calls in readMetaData relied on the `/folder/itembyname.json` api which is buggy: items written to a directory take an arbitrary amount of time to appear via this endpoint, and the file info returned does not include the file hash.\r\n\r\n2) resolves a bug caused by an undocumented feature of the `move_copy` endpoint which silently truncates new filenames to 255 char. rclone (correctly) throws an error when attempting to create a file or directory that surpasses the max length for opendrive, but there is no check performed in the move_copy command. Without such a check files written to the remote may have their names modified unknowingly. \r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5936\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution
