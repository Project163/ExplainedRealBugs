This is useful when uploading files with\r\n                 compressible content (such as .js, .css, or .html files)\r\n                 because it saves network bandwidth and space in Google Cloud\r\n                 Storage, which in turn reduces storage costs.\r\n\r\n                 When you specify the -z option, the data from your files is\r\n                 compressed before it is uploaded, but your actual files are\r\n                 left uncompressed on the local disk. The uploaded objects\r\n                 retain the Content-Type and name of the original files but are\r\n                 given a Content-Encoding header with the value \"gzip\" to\r\n                 indicate that the object data stored are compressed on the\r\n                 Google Cloud Storage servers.\r\n\r\n                 For example, the following command:\r\n\r\n                   gsutil cp -z html -a public-read cattypes.html gs://mycats\r\n\r\n                 will do all of the following:\r\n\r\n                 - Upload as the object gs://mycats/cattypes.html (cp command)\r\n                 - Set the Content-Type to text/html (based on file extension)\r\n                 - Compress the data in the file cattypes.html (-z option)\r\n                 - Set the Content-Encoding to gzip (-z option)\r\n                 - Set the ACL to public-read (-a option)\r\n                 - If a user tries to view cattypes.html in a browser, the\r\n                   browser will know to uncompress the data based on the\r\n                   Content-Encoding header, and to render it as HTML based on\r\n                   the Content-Type header.\r\n\r\n                 Note that if you download an object with Content-Encoding:gzip\r\n                 gsutil will decompress the content before writing the local\r\n                 file.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think `--no-gzip-encoding` should be doing the right thing... Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working as I can see rclone is still outputing `Accept-Encoding: gzip` - perhaps the SDK is overriding that.\r\n\r\nHowever `--no-gzip-encoding` would download the file compressed which probably isn't what the user expects.\r\n\r\nWhat would you expect rclone to do?

However, I could see a case for automatic decompression upon saving since `Content-Encoding` is often transparent to users (such as the use case described in the `gsutil` help you quoted).\r\n\r\nHaving a flag for user-selectable behavior might not be a bad idea.

Thank you!\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n \r\n> However, I noticed that it doesn't preserve the Content-Encoding (or custom metadata) when copying from GCS to Azure. Should I open a separate issue for that, or would you like to discuss in this one? \r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of metadata, general purpose key, value storage and what I'll call HTTP metadata\r\n- Access control metadata\r\n- Cache-Control\r\n- Content-Disposition\r\n- Content-Encoding\r\n- Content-Language\r\n- Content-Type\r\n\r\nRclone deals with `Content-Type` already but it doesn't deal with the other kinds of metadata.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue already about custom metadata #111.  That is quite an old issue but I think it would be much easier to implement now-a-days.  You'll see various other issues linked from there.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if rclone could copy metadata from cloud to cloud, and also set it on upload.  This would be a reasonably big project though!\r\n\r\nThe way it would work is that I'd give each Object an optional interface `ReadMetadata` and that would be supplied.  On upload this would be read and set on the object.\r\n\r\n> In either case, I will write up more details and a test case.\r\n\r\nThat would be useful - can you put it in #111.  I'll move that issue up into the run Q since I think its time has come :-)\r\n\r\nI think the only thing I'm not sure about is how to represent the http metadata and the non http metadata in a cross cloud sort of way.  Perhaps ReadMetadata should return two dictionaries or one dictionary and one `http.Header`\r\n\r\nThinking aloud this could also subsume the `Content-Type` mechanism.\r\n\r\nDocs\r\n- gcs: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata\r\n- azureblob: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-properties\r\n- s3: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html\r\n\r\nThis could also (with a flag) be implemented as attributes on local files.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/430604040/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/430613304","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2658#issuecomment-430613304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2658","id":430613304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMDYxMzMwNA==","user":{"login":"kevinoid","id":336433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/336433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinoid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinoid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-17T12:44:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T12:44:32Z","body":"That sounds great.
