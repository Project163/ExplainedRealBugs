Anything that is stored in the Roaming folder is copied back to the AD server when they log off. And any machine they log on will copy down this folder so that the next machine they log into will have this data on that machine. The Local folder is basically you installed it on this one machine and you don't want this data to travel with the user account. A lot of programmers just use the Roaming folder because it's the best of both worlds and lets say for instance we wanted to make sure rclone was installed on every machine then having the config move with the user is perfect if you forced only local then they would have to config it again on every machine they go to. Some have no idea how their app will be used so they use the roaming folder instead of the local folder. Some know exactly how they want the app to be used and it should only ever be on the machine it was installed on.\r\n\r\nI would think in this case that the roaming folder is the best choice to place it as you don't know how rclone will be deployed it will be able to work both ways local and roaming.

you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nUse %AppData% as primary default for configuration file on Windows, which is more in line with Windows standards, while existing default of using home directory is more Unix standards - though that made rclone more consistent accross different OS.\r\n\r\nMain changes from existing (something for release notes?)\r\n- Any existing configuration file should be picked up in exactly the same way as before, so no changes for **existing** configs.\r\n  - Well.. with one possible exception: If there happens to be a file `%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf`, it would not have been picked up automatically before, but could be used by explicitely referring to it with `$RCLONE_CONFIG` or `--config`, but will now be picked up automatically. That *could* lead to surprises on upgrade, but not very likely.\r\n- Windows:\r\n  - Default path when creating new configuration file is now `%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf`.\r\n  - Previously, configuration file would typically be created in `%USERPROFILE%\\.config\\rclone\\rclone.conf`\r\n    - One could set environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and it would instead be created in `%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%/rclone/rclone.conf`, this is no longer the case (see next point).\r\n  - `%USERPROFILE%\\.config\\rclone\\rclone.conf` will still be used in the unlikely event of `%AppData%` not being defined, but in any case a variable `%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%` will no longer be considered when rclone is creating new config (but will still be considered if an existing configuration file is found there, to avoid breaking existing setups).\r\n\r\n\r\nMain rules (see also changed documentation):\r\n- If custom location configured with `$RCLONE_CONFIG` or `--config`, it will be used regardless.\r\n- Else, search for existing file in prioritized order:\r\n  1. `<rclone_exe_dir>/rclone.conf`\r\n  2. `%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf` (Windows only)\r\n  3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf`\r\n  4. `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`\r\n  5. `~/.rclone.conf`\r\n- Else, create new in default location:\r\n  - Windows: Path 2 above.\r\n  - Unix/non-windows: If XDG_CONFIG_HOME defined path 3, else path 4.\r\n\r\nNote: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is kind of a \"bastard\" on Windows: This is not a common variable to set in Windows, but previous versions of rclone did consider it on all platforms, preferring it over `~/.config`. It will still be considered after this PR, for backwards compatible reasons, but only for reading existing configuration file found there.\r\n\r\n#### Testing and documenting behavior\r\n\r\nTests performed with command `rclone config file`, no existing configuration file, verify what is chosen as default config location.\r\nLast performed with beta version: https://github.com/albertony/rclone/releases/tag/v1.56.0-appdata05\r\n\r\nNote regarding permission testing:\r\n- Rclone will first look for a configuration file, and if not found pick a configuration directory to use for a new file.\r\n- When picking a new configuration directory rclone will check permissions: It checks that it can create the config directory, e.g. `~/.config/rclone`, but does not verify permission to actually create a config file in it. This means when HOME is defined, but rclone has no permission to write to it, then rclone will find it cannot create directory `~/.config/rclone` and fallback to `~/.rclone.conf`, and \"happily\" assume that is a valid path - even though it will not actually have permission to create such a file! Attempting to create it at a later point in time (`rclone config touch`) will fail with:\r\n  > ERROR : Failed to save config after 10 tries: Failed to create temp file for new config: open /tmp/xxx_home/.rclone.conf693553371: permission denied\r\n- If the configuration directory already exists, e.g. `~/.config/rclone`, then permissions will not be checked. So if rclone does not (no longer) have write access here, it will still pick this one instead of using fallback - unlike what it would do if `~/.config/rclone` did not exist and rclone failed to create it.\r\n- After the configuration file path has been found (either an existing, or path to where to store a new one), rclone will try to read it. This is also done in a simple `rclone config file` test.\r\n  - If the file exists, a debug message is printed:\r\n    > Using config file from %q\r\n  - If user has permission to directory but file is not there, rclone will report notice:\r\n    > Config file %q not found - using defaults\r\n  - If user does not have traverse permissions to the directory, rclone will fail with fatal:\r\n    > Failed to load config file %q: %v\r\n\r\nLinux (arch WSL):\r\n- Normal user (with a home)\r\n  - XDG_CONFIG_HOME defined:\r\n    - Permission: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/.rclone.conf`\r\n    - No write permission: `~/.rclone.conf`\r\n       - Note: Does not fallback to  ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf!\r\n  - XDG_CONFIG_HOME **not** defined:\r\n    - Permission to ~/.config: `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`\r\n    - No write permission to ~/.config: `~/.rclone.conf`\r\n  - No write or traverse permission to \\~: `Failed to load config file \"~/.rclone.conf\": permission denied`\r\n     - Note: The rclone config file command just returns this error message. It found that it could not create the config directory and that ~/.rclone.conf is the path to use, but then attempting to load it fails with \"permission denied\" instead of \"not found\".\r\n     - Note: Does not fallback to .rclone.conf\r\n  - HOME variable modified: `$HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`\r\n- User with no home (empty in passwd file)\r\n  - No home-related environment:
