I figured I should still report it since it seems like a footgun. I can't quite wrap around why `rclone` would do what it did in this case.\r\n\r\nI tried running `rclone purge \"$VAR\"` where $VAR should have interpolated to `remote:path` but wasn't defined (due to a typo). Before I realized my error, large parts of my home directory were gone before I could stop the command. I only had a `b2` and `crypt` remote configured, no local remote or similiar. Looking at the docs for purge, it does not seem like this should happen.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nv1.51.0\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu 20.04 64-bit\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nB2, although it does not matter here\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n`rclone purge \"$ACCIDENTALLY_EMPTY_ENV_VAR\"`\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nDon't have any, don't want to nuke my home dir again\r\n\r\nEdit:Added missing `\"\"` around env var in command in order to correctly illustrate the problem","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
