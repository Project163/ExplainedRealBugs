Standard AWS S3 SDK does not have `GetBucketInfo` API, so we need to introduce [aliyun-oss-go-sdk](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-oss-go-sdk).\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.66.0\r\n- os/version: darwin 14.4.1 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 23.4.0 (arm64)\r\n- os/type: darwin\r\n- os/arch: arm64 (ARMv8 compatible)\r\n- go/version: go1.22.1\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\ndarwin, 64bit\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
