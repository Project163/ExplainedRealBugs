We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/print-new-line-between-files-when-using-rclone-cat/37732/8\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ rclone version\r\nrclone v1.62.2\r\n- os/version: ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.20.2\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nI am trying to output several remote files from an S3 bucket to stdout. Each file contains a single line. I'd like each file to output to a separate line also. However, rclone cat joins the files without any separator, which makes the output unusable/unreadable. Is there any way to accomplish this?\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThe simplest idea I had is to add an option to `rclone cat` that will print a \"separator\" string after outputting each file. E.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone cat s3:bucket/path --include */file.txt --separator '\\n'\r\nfile1\r\nfile2\r\nfile3\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
