The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\nAssociated with a merged solution for a bug [https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4348](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4348) which is similar to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nRclone reports 0 used and 0 available space from WebDav Nextcloud. Even if I use the flag `--vfs-disk-space-total-size 1T` the total space then is 1T (tested on Windows 11), but available space is still 0. GUI programs fail to write to it as they check for available space, while CLI file commands like `cp` and `mv` work fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[REDACTED ~]$ rclone version\r\nrclone v1.62.2\r\n- os/version: arch \"rolling\" (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.3.8-arch1-1 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.20.4\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nArch Linux and Windows 11. Happens on both.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?\r\n\r\nWebDav Nextcloud. I host one myself, the other is a [Hetzner Storage Share](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-share).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run?\r\n\r\nJust:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone mount nextcloud-personal:\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use it as a systemd mount (as instructed in Rclone documentation):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Unit]\r\nAfter=network-online.target\r\n[Mount]\r\nType=rclone\r\nWhat=nextcloud-personal:\r\nWhere=/mnt/nextcloud_personal\r\nOptions=rw,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=full,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n```\r\n[REDACTED ~]$ rclone about nextcloud-personal:  -vv --dump bodies\r\n<7>DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.62.2\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"about\" \"nextcloud-personal:\" \"-vv\" \"--dump\" \"bodies\"]\r\n<7>DEBUG : rclone: systemd logging support activated\r\n<7>DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"nextcloud-personal:\"\r\n<7>DEBUG : Using config file from \"/home/REDACTED/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\"\r\n<7>DEBUG : found headers: \r\n<7>DEBUG : You have specified to dump information. Please be noted that the Accept-Encoding as shown may not be correct in the request and the response may not show Content-Encoding if the go standard libraries auto gzip encoding was in effect.
