I set the file to a specific last-accessed and last-modified date using `touch -amt 202412092222 file`:\r\n```bash\r\nls -la\r\ndrwxr-xr-x cubic cubic 60 B Sat Dec 21 23:07:20 2024  .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x cubic cubic 60 B Sat Dec 21 23:07:13 2024  ..\r\n.rw-r--r-- cubic cubic  0 B Mon Dec  9 22:22:00 2024  file\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I now serve the file via http from the directory `test` using `rclone serve http test` I get:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl --head localhost:8080/file\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nLast-Modified: Mon, 09 Dec 2024 21:22:00 GMT\r\nServer: rclone/v1.68.2\r\nDate: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 22:11:46 GMT\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if I serve the directory `test` as a bucket with the file `file` in it using `rclone serve s3 .` I get:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl --head localhost:8080/test/file\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Accept-Encoding, Authorization, Content-Disposition, Content-Length, Content-Type, X-Amz-Date, X-Amz-User-Agent, X-CSRF-Token, x-amz-acl, x-amz-content-sha256, x-amz-meta-filename, x-amz-meta-from, x-amz-meta-private, x-amz-meta-to, x-amz-security-token\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, HEAD\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\r\nEtag: \"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\"\r\nLast-Modified: Mon, 9 Dec 2024 22:22:00 GMT\r\nServer: AmazonS3\r\nX-Amz-Id-2: RUNEMjk5NzlFQ0MyQkM2OEVDRDI5OTc5RUNDMkJDNjhFQ0QyOTk3OUVDQzJCQzY4RUNEMjk5NzlFQ0MyQkM2OA==\r\nX-Amz-Request-Id: ECD29979ECC2BC68\r\nDate: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 22:08:03 GMT\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two things to note: The `Last-Modified` header from the s3 server has the value `Mon, 9 Dec 2024 22:22:00 GMT`. This is invalid, as the date, as far as I understand the corresponding RFC and [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Last-Modified), must be in a two-digit representation (same as the http server sends). It also differs from the http response by one hour. My time zone is GMT+1, it seems to use the local time and GMT inconsistently.\r\n\r\nI came across this bug by using pgBackRest to backup my postgres cluster against s3 provided by rclone and it failed with `ERROR: [029]: invalid month 'ec '` during the debug. After looking through the debug log for the string I discovered that it refers to the cut off `Dec` month. It probably reads the date header in fixed offsets which always expect the date to be 2 digits long.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n1.68.2\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nLinux 64 bit\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
