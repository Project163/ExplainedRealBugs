have a little experience bash scripting. The main issue with this is how portable rclone is. To get proper bash completion support you need to have a script which loads the autocompletion function into the bash environment. Normally this is done by putting the script in a specific folder. You could also include a bash script with go or perhaps the best solution is to have rclone modify the necessary environment variables with a flag (example: rclone --init_autocomplete) for [example](https://superuser.com/questions/523562/script-specific-autocomplete-in-shell). There are also [clever approaches](https://github.com/posener/complete) to abuse go packages to manage autocomplete for you.\r\n\r\nThe second approach is probably the best one to use. rclone would need to be able to \"install\" and uninstall it's autocompletion scripts though, that could be easily done with command flags though.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/315892241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Skylion007","id":2053727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTM3Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2053727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007","html_url":"https://github.com/Skylion007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Skylion007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/363207993","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1529#issuecomment-363207993","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1529","id":363207993,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzIwNzk5Mw==","user":{"login":"danemacmillan","id":4390491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTA0OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4390491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan","html_url":"https://github.com/danemacmillan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danemacmillan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-05T20:16:29Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T20:16:29Z","body":"I'd be happy to get tab completion for just the names of remotes to get things started.
