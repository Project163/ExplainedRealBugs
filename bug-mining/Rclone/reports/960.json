Trying again in 300 seconds.\" error occurs. From that point on, no further log entries appear and the mount seems to have hung up. Neither a timeout nor any other attribute helps. Only a restart of the service solves the problem.\r\n\r\nAn attempt at 'df -h' or an 'ls' freezes completely.\r\n\r\nWith my Google Drive mount, the problem does not occur. I get i/o errors sometimes but it does not freeze.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.54.1\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
