use 64-bit Windows 7 and generally love it, but was stumped for awhile with this same backup problem. Apparently reparse points are related to or associated with backup restore points in some manner. I had moved files to a new physical disk and partition I installed recently. Backups of the moved files were failing with the 0x81000037 error. I followed the steps below and was able to get a successful backup.\n1. Open Windows Explorer and right click the drive letter where the files are stored that cannot be backed up. Click Properties.\n2. From the General tab click \"Disk Cleanup\".\n3. On the Disk Cleanup window, switch to the More Options tab.\n4. In the System Restore and Shadow Copies section, click \"Clean up...\"\n5. Click Delete\n\n> This initially made me nervous about possible file deletion, so before testing I made another copy of the files to a different partition - a backup of my backup I guess. However this process apparently only deletes restore point information associated with files on a given partition. Once that was done, backups worked fine.\n\nSo you could try that and see if it improves things.\n\nI could also ignore the ModeSymlink on windows which may or may not do the right thing, I'm not sure!\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/242504258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/242533772","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/614#issuecomment-242533772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/614","id":242533772,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjUzMzc3Mg==","user":{"login":"andrewhollomon","id":20995329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTk1MzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20995329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewhollomon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T20:43:47Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T20:43:47Z","body":"Thanks, based on what you discovered about reparse points; some additional information that may be relevant is that the zip file in question lives on a volume with [Microsoft Server's native volume deduplication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh769303%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) feature enabled.\n\nThe same volume is also protected using Microsoft Shadow Copies.

not that I've changed the way this works as the original fix causes different problems (see #2336), so now to backup files with reparse points you'll have to use the `-L` flag.  This change will be in effect from v1.42 which I'm just about to release.\r\n\r\nThis will have the unfortunate effect that if you are using `rclone sync` with v1.42 and  you don't use `-L` then it will delete the files with reparse points from the backup, so please add the `-L` to your script before trying v1.42.  Also try first with --dry-run!\r\n\r\nThanks","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/397827068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1684718259,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY4NDcxODI1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1684718259","actor":{"login":"andrewhollomon","id":20995329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTk1MzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20995329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewhollomon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-16T17:19:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1684718260,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2ODQ3MTgyNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1684718260","actor":{"login":"andrewhollomon","id":20995329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTk1MzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20995329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewhollomon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewhollomon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-16T17:19:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
