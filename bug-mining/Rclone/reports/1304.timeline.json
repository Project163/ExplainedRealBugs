In rclone v1.67.0\r\n    \r\n    RCLONE_EXCLUDE=a,b\r\n    \r\nWould be interpreted as\r\n    \r\n    --exclude \"a,b\"\r\n    \r\nWhereas this new code will interpret it as\r\n    \r\n    --exclude \"a\" --exclude \"b\"\r\n    \r\nThe benefit of being able to set multiple values with an environment variable was deemed to outweigh the very small backwards compatibility risk.\r\n    \r\nIf a value with a `,` is needed, then use CSV escaping, eg\r\n    \r\n    RCLONE_EXCLUDE=\"a,b\"\r\n    \r\n(Note this needs to have the quotes in so at the unix shell that would be\r\n    \r\n    RCLONE_EXCLUDE='\"a,b\"'\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2344718575/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14223104570,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M6WGzK4zwAAAANPw1o6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/14223104570","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-11T21:19:54Z","label":{"name":"Point
