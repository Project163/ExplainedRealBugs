In some instances this is undesired behaviour e.g. cancelling a 50GB transfer with 1MB remaining because the limit has been reached.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have a `--graceful` or similar tag which would allow any remaining transfers to be completed, even if this meant exceeding `--max-transfer`.  \r\n\r\n`--graceful` would be desirous with google drive as an alternative to trying to set `--bwlimit` to stay within the daily 750GB limit, and any transfers that started before the 750GB limit would complete with the rclone move operation exiting cleanly, rather than getting subsequent errors from transfers that won't work.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2672/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
