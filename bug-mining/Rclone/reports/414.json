far as I can tell -- and I may be confused, I'm not certain -- when I use `rclone cryptdecode` on an encrypted remote which is backed by a Backblaze B2 remote, logs into the backing remote before doing the filename decode.\r\n\r\nThis costs money, since Backblaze charges for login transactions.\r\n\r\nIt also takes time for the login, which arguably should be instantaneous.\r\n\r\nRclone
