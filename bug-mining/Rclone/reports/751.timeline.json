you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\nIt allows users to specify the maximum duration of a transfer session sort of as requested in #985, making it easier to script rclone to e.g. backup during the night. The setting I've added introduces a duration flag. After rclone has been running for that amount of time, no new transfers will be initiated, but those already started will be able allowed to complete. It may be useful to implement a further flag for a hard limit that will terminate in-progress transfers once the session limit is reached, but in another PR.\r\n\r\nNote - Since `--max-transfer` doesn't appear to have tests, neither does this feature. I have tested the non-server copy manually though - I've never used server mode so would need some pointers to test that.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\nSort of in #985\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2977167169,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5NzcxNjcxNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2977167169","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1ea9d9279e78c1bc9d95a77e2430e374e806af7b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boosh/rclone/commits/1ea9d9279e78c1bc9d95a77e2430e374e806af7b","created_at":"2020-01-24T13:08:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2977224308,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk3NzIyNDMwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2977224308","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0d7573dd81ed16eb5db42352698b1344cfa2b63e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/0d7573dd81ed16eb5db42352698b1344cfa2b63e","created_at":"2020-01-24T13:28:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
