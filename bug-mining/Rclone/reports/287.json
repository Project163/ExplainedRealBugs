(eg Google Drive)\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n> The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrconfig\r\n\r\nJust discovered this project, it's **awesome**. Followed the directions at http://rclone.org/drive/ and ran into a minor problem configuring the storage type. The docs show choosing `6` but in reality the number is now `7`. This is the current output of the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own value\r\n 1 / Amazon Drive\r\n   \\ \"amazon cloud drive\"\r\n 2 / Amazon S3 (also Dreamhost, Ceph, Minio)\r\n   \\ \"s3\"\r\n 3 / Backblaze B2\r\n   \\ \"b2\"\r\n 4 / Dropbox\r\n   \\ \"dropbox\"\r\n 5 / Encrypt/Decrypt a remote\r\n   \\ \"crypt\"\r\n 6 / Google Cloud Storage (this is not Google Drive)\r\n   \\ \"google cloud storage\"\r\n 7 / Google Drive\r\n   \\ \"drive\"\r\n 8 / Hubic\r\n   \\ \"hubic\"\r\n 9 / Local Disk\r\n   \\ \"local\"\r\n10 / Microsoft OneDrive\r\n   \\ \"onedrive\"\r\n11 / Openstack Swift (Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)\r\n   \\ \"swift\"\r\n12 / Yandex Disk\r\n   \\ \"yandex\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, if you accidentally choose 6-- because it's been seeded in your head by the docs--, everything goes normally, including the part where it opens a browser window and gets the google API key. And, of course, nothing works for Google Drive because you get a `can't list buckets without project number` error. So there's a little bit of confirmation bias going on there, and it's not until you google the problem that you catch that the error is self-inflicted.\r\n\r\nIt's a reasonable guess that the same problem was had here: https://forum.rclone.org/t/cant-list-buckets-without-project-number/581.\r\n\r\nAnyway, cheers to this project! Can't believe how seamless this has made my cloud experience. Wish I would have found it before.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
