Nick, new issue per your request. A static stat block, like the current one, except it's persistent and only the information changes. I'll add my details later when I'm not on mobile, but just wanted to get the issue made for you.\r\n\r\nSo here's the low-down on the idea from the other issue:\r\n\r\nThe current stats block....\r\n\r\nTransferred: 42.317 MBytes (119.671 kBytes/s)\r\nErrors: 4\r\nChecks: 28252\r\nTransferred: 296\r\nElapsed time: 6m2s\r\nTransferring:\r\n\r\nvar/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.list: 100% done, 522 Bytes/s, ETA: 0s\r\nvar/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.postrm: 100% done, 132 Bytes/s, ETA: 0s\r\nvar/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.md5sums: 100% done, 425 Bytes/s, ETA: 0s\r\nvar/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-4:armhf.postinst: 0% done, 0 Bytes/s, ETA: -\r\nLast Error: List last error here.\r\n\r\nI say print out this format as a static block if someone uses -stats, then update the stats in place (like --info=progress2 in rync). Adding the last error that was received at the bottom. Write off all errors to a file, then list them once the transfer is done.\r\n\r\nThen once the transfer is done, the last block of stats and the errors are written off to output for peoples logs that use them.\r\n\r\nThis way you can get an update on what's going on at a glance, but you don't have a scrolling wall of text both onscreen and in your logs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"caspertone2003","id":4682903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODI5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4682903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003","html_url":"https://github.com/caspertone2003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caspertone2003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-20T02:15:39Z","updated_at":"2018-07-20T02:15:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrykcoding/rcloneExplorer/issues/154","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrykcoding/rcloneExplorer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrykcoding/rcloneExplorer/issues/154/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrykcoding/rcloneExplorer/issues/154/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrykcoding/rcloneExplorer/issues/154/events","html_url":"https://github.com/patrykcoding/rcloneExplorer/issues/154","id":337284686,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzcyODQ2ODY=","number":154,"title":"See

What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nstats print to stderr along with all other logging, but stats don't really make much sense in a log except for maybe an overall summary at the very end.  A periodic stats message is meant to show the user what is going on at that moment (serving as both a general summary and basic progress indicator).  Especially when logging to a file, having a multitude of stats messages interspersed with the actual logs makes for messy log IMO.  Of course you can disable stats entirely to have a cleaner log file, but then you lose any progress indicator entirely.  I would argue that stats should only display on stdout, and there should be a separate option if someone wants a summary of the finished operation printed to stderr.\r\n\r\nI know there are currently changes being made to how stats are formatted and operate, but unless I missed something I haven't seen anyone talking recently about stats in the context of stdout/stderr.\r\n\r\nAnother more general related concept that might be worthwhile would be to have separate log level contexts for transports (one for the console, and another for files).  That would give a lot of flexibility for different scenarios.\r\n\r\nI'd love to be able to submit a PR at some point, but I'm not familiar with Go at the moment, so it might be a steep learning curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2453/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T17:01:52Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T17:01:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/379","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/379/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/379/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/379/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/379","id":138430240,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMzg0MzAyNDA=","number":379,"title":"Add

By default, rclone should display **total** progress of operation and **total throughput** of all threads - total download/upload speed maintained.\n\nMaybe something inspired by curl progress? \n![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m7O1i.png)\n\nOr like wget ?\n![](http://www.thelinuxterminal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wget-download-1140x344_c.png)\n![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DlhB25swqEs/UZe0CPLAv6I/AAAAAAAAAIc/Ig5nSOpv2fw/s1600/Progress+Label.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/379/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-17T17:03:11Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T17:03:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/389","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/389/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/389/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/389/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/389","id":140381579,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjI2NDA4MDQ=","number":389,"title":"Proposal for revising stats display.","user":{"login":"klauspost","id":5663952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjM5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5663952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost","html_url":"https://github.com/klauspost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-03-12T12:59:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T17:03:22Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T17:03:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"repository":{"id":17803236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzgwMzIzNg==","name":"rclone","full_name":"rclone/rclone","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rclone","id":24937341,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0OTM3MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24937341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone","description":"\"rsync for cloud storage\" -
