This is either due to a bad username or authentication information.` error.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```config\r\n# rclone version\r\nrclone v1.61.1\r\n- os/version: centos 7.9.2009 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 3.10.0-1160.62.1.el7.x86_64 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.19.4\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nCentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 , 64 bits\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nSMB Share\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# rclone --low-level-retries 1 ls myNAS-SMB:\r\n2024/04/24 15:45:13 ERROR : : error listing: couldn't connect SMB: response error: The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information.\r\n2024/04/24 15:45:13 Failed to ls with 2 errors: last error was: couldn't connect SMB: response error: The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# rclone --low-level-retries 1 -vv ls myNAS-SMB:\r\n2024/04/24 15:42:10 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.61.1\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"--low-level-retries\" \"1\" \"-vv\" \"ls\" \"myNAS-SMB:\"]\r\n2024/04/24 15:42:10 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"myNAS-SMB:\"\r\n2024/04/24 15:42:10 DEBUG : Using config file from \"/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\"\r\n2024/04/24 15:42:10 DEBUG : pacer: low level retry 1/1 (error couldn't connect SMB: response error: The attempted logon is invalid.
