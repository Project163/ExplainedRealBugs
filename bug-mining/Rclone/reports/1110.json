The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/ftp-does-not-play-well-with-files-from/31158\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.59.0-beta.5996.3a89ee1bb\r\n- os/version: darwin 11.5.2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 20.6.0 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: darwin\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.16.2\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nRclone calls `NewObject` which in turn calls `FindItem` which in turn calls `List` on the parent directory for every single file of `--files-from-raw` which does not scale at all.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to provide a more efficient way when supported by the remote FTP server.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nUse a more efficient method when supported by the remote server to retrieve an item by using `MLST` command.\r\n\r\nI'd argue that keeping the original behavior (based on List) might be unwanted and it could be useful to forbid it as an opt-in.\r\n\r\nPR provided here: https://github.com/jlaffaye/ftp/pull/258 (or https://github.com/rclone/ftp/pull/1)\r\n\r\nAn exemple of implementation could be:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// findItem finds a directory entry for the name in its parent directory\r\nfunc (f *Fs) findItem(ctx context.Context, remote string) (entry *ftp.Entry, err error) {\r\n\t// defer fs.Trace(remote, \"\")(\"o=%v, err=%v\", &o, &err)\r\n\tfullPath := path.Join(f.root, remote)\r\n\tif fullPath == \"\" || fullPath == \".\" || fullPath == \"/\" {\r\n\t\t// if root, assume exists and synthesize an entry\r\n\t\treturn &ftp.Entry{\r\n\t\t\tName: \"\",\r\n\t\t\tType: ftp.EntryTypeFolder,\r\n\t\t\tTime: time.Now(),\r\n\t\t}, nil\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tc, err := f.getFtpConnection(ctx)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"findItem: %w\", err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tentry, err = c.Stat(fullPath)\r\n\tf.putFtpConnection(&c, err)\r\n\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn nil, translateErrorFile(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif entry != nil {\r\n\t\tf.entryToStandard(entry)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn entry, nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this context the original behavior was dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍
