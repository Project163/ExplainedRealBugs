We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.48.0-211-g82c6c77e-beta\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.9\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nRclone dedupe termintates completely if it encounters an insufficientFilePermisson error,\r\nshouldn't it just skip the files it cannot edit/delete and continue operation on the rest of the files?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\"rclone dedupe will terminate if any of the commands it does fail... This isn't ideal!\r\nIt could be made to continue some of the errors quite easily I think.\"\r\n\r\nSee: https://forum.rclone.org/t/dedupe-terminating-on-insufficientfilepermisson-error/11368\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3470/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
