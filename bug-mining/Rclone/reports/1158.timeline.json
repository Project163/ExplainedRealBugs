If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the changes here\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen using `rclone cat` to print the contents of several files, the\r\nuser may want to inject some separator between the files, such as a\r\ncomma or a newline. This patch adds a `--separator` option to the `cat`\r\ncommand to make that possible. The default value remains an empty\r\nstring, `\"\"`, maintaining the prior behavior of `rclone cat`.\r\n\r\nCloses #6968\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* https://forum.rclone.org/t/print-new-line-between-files-when-using-rclone-cat/37732/14\r\n*
