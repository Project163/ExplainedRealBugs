This may be related to the `--s3-decompress` parameter which now also needs to be used and apparently had a bug regarding [metadata](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6434).\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.60.0\r\n- os/version: debian 11.5 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.18.0-0.deb11.4-amd64 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.19.2\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nDebian 11, 64 Bit\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
