[FILE]...\r\n```\r\n\r\nso what you have to do is to add NAME section to rclone man generated page and submit PR.\r\n\r\nHowever I think linux man page is something nobody really paid much attention to.  IMO `man rclone` is \"useless\" at the moment - it is 50k lines (270k words) saga and does not really follow man pages [established practices](https://betterprogramming.pub/man-pages-the-complete-guide-800ad93425fe). I doubt anybody uses it...\r\n\r\nIf you feel it is worth you can make it better including fixing `whatis` issue.\r\n\r\nBut given that rclone does not really follow Unix philosophy \"make each program do one thing well\" - and does million things (to do it well is never ending work in progress)  creating proper man page might be sisyphean
