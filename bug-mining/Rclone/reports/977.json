I also used iperf3 to verify that DSCP tags weren't being mangled/washed by the network stack, and iperf3 emitted DSCP-tagged packets as expected.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Start tcpdump/Wireshark/tshark\r\n2. Invoke rclone with the `--dscp LE` argument (works for all possible values, not just `LE`). For example: `rclone --dscp LE copy testfile remote:`. Optionally, add `--bind <address>` to force IPv4 on a dual-stack host.\r\n3. After rclone finishes, check the DiffServ field of an outgoing packet to see that it isn't being marked (CS0). In Wireshark, this shows as `Differentiated Services Field: 0x00 (DSCP: CS0, ECN: Not-ECT)` for IPv4, and `Traffic Class: 0x00 (DSCP: CS0, ECN: Not-ECT)` for IPv6.\r\n\r\nI've attached the following:\r\n* A packet capture from the macOS example (IPv6) [rclone-dscp-bug-mac-v6.pcapng.gz](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/files/6402470/rclone-dscp-bug-mac-v6.pcapng.gz)\r\n* The corresponding debug log [rclone-dscp-bug-mac.log](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/files/6402471/rclone-dscp-bug-mac.log)\r\n\r\nNeither of us is familiar with golang, but I'll try to get a debug build running to narrow down the problem. I wanted to put it out there in case somebody more familiar with rclone/golang can spot the error faster.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nI put it into a debugger, and the problem appears to be in `dialer.go`: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/9e2fbe0f1a9314e1330b4adc9d69de137be12ee6/fs/fshttp/dialer.go#L48-L68\r\n\r\nI set breakpoints at lines 55-57. 55 and 56 are called as expected, but **line 57 is never reached**. Therefore, `SetTrafficClass`/`SetTOS` are never called.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
