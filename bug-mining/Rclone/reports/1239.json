The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-cant-create-file-system/43471/18?u=nielash\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nA trailing slash in a quoted local path command arg on Windows causes a fatal error. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbisync --resync QuickAccess: \"U:\\Documents\\OneDrive1\\\" --config \"U:\\Settings\\Rclone\\config\" -vv\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023/12/15 12:05:36 Failed to bisync: prior lock file found: C:\\Users\\Graeme\\AppData\\Local\\rclone\\bisync\\C__Users_Graeme_QuickAccess..U__Documents_OneDrive1\"_--config_U__Settings_Rclone_config_-vv.lck\r\n```\r\n\r\nReported on the forum by a user, and I was able to reproduce it. Removing the trailing slash resolves the issue (confirmed by user). While the fix is easy, it's not immediately obvious, so I think it would be worth trying to catch this and handle it better. Looks like possibly the backslash is being interpreted as escaping the quote -- probably an easy fix. \r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.65.0\r\n- os/version: Microsoft Windows 11 Home 23H2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 10.0.22631.2861 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: windows\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.21.4\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
