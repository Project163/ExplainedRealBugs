An error occurs when attempting to do this.\n\n```\nsddm-helper[1436]: (mount.c:68): Messages from underlying mount program:\nsddm[1436]: (mount.c:68): Messages from underlying mount program:\nsddm[1436]: (mount.c:72): Enter configuration password:\nsddm[1436]: (mount.c:72): password:2025/03/29 14:46:36 CRITICAL: Failed to read line: EOF\nsddm-helper[1436]: (mount.c:72): Enter configuration password:\nsddm-helper[1436]: (mount.c:72): password:2025/03/29 14:46:36 CRITICAL: Failed to read line: EOF\nsddm-helper[1436]: (pam_mount.c:522): mount of Proton:/Sync failed\nsddm[1436]: (pam_mount.c:522): mount of Proton:/Sync failed\n```\n\nRclone's behavior is to throw an error whenever it encounters and EOF in stdin, even if a password was entered.\n\n```\n// fs/config/ui.go\nline, err := buf.ReadString('\\n')\nif err != nil {\n\tfs.Fatalf(nil, \"Failed to read line: %v\", err)\n}\n```\n\nI have found and tested a fix that would ignore EOFs if the read string is not empty, and will submit a PR shortly.\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\n```\nrclone v1.69.1\n- os/version: arch (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 6.13.8-arch1-1 (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.24.0\n- go/linking: dynamic\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nArch Linux x86_64\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\n\nProton Drive\n\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\nI assume under-the-hood this would be `mount.rclone Proton:/Sync /home/samantha/Mounts/Proton/Sync -o config=/home/samantha/.config/rclone/rclone.conf,vfs_cache_mode=writes`.\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
