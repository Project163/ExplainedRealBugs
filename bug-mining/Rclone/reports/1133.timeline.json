I guess it uses fs instead of path to remount a backend.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1992259630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WifiAccessPoint","id":91138398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTM4Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91138398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint","html_url":"https://github.com/WifiAccessPoint","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WifiAccessPoint/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1992261878","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6769#issuecomment-1992261878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6769","id":1992261878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M52v4D2","user":{"login":"animosity022","id":5088712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODg3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5088712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022","html_url":"https://github.com/animosity022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-12T18:07:21Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T18:07:21Z","body":"If not fixed, your best bet would be to open up a new issue with all the details.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1992261878/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"animosity022","id":5088712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODg3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5088712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022","html_url":"https://github.com/animosity022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
