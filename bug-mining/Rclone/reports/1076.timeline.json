recently in ec72432cecdc4eee9abf25e3fb0119d897b5bba2 to fix a bug with renaming files\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing that\r\n- a file was added to the mount\r\n- it was then renamed\r\n- it was then opened before the original upload had completed\r\n\r\nI tried that sequence, but it didn't reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\nTo have any hope of fixing this, I need to have either a way to reproduce the problem

just having the same issue. I've recently configured NFS client on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine to download files from Telegram to rclone mount shared folder (vfs cache). Everything seems to look good, but after downloading several files rclone always crashes.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\nHere is my situation:\r\n\r\n**Server (QNAP NAS):**\r\n\r\nrclone share mount:\r\n\r\nrclone mount rclonecrypt:Downloads /share/homes/rclone/Downloads/RClone --config=/share/homes/rclone/.config/rclone/rclone.conf --allow-other --bwlimit 8M --dir-cache-time 1000h --umask 002 --vfs-cache-mode writes --vfs-cache-max-age 0h0m0s --cache-dir /share/homes/rclone/Downloads/cacherclone --log-level INFO --log-file /share/homes/rclone/Downloads/rclonelog --poll-interval 15s --user-agent menjaomatic --rc-addr=localhost:5575\r\n\r\nQNAP Shared NFS folder:\r\n\r\nThen to be able to share by nfs the rclone mounted Google Drive in QNAP, I need to create a share folder (/share/RClone_downloads) who has defined an access route (/share/homes/rclone/Downloads/RClone) and configure the nfs access to /share/RClone_downloads folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Client (Ubuntu Virtual Machine on the same QNAP NAS):**\r\n\r\nNFS mount:\r\nmount -t nfs4 -o vers=4.0 nas_ip:/RClone_downloads  /mnt/downloads\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything works as expected, I can download some files from Telegram (4-5) and then rclone crashes with the \"fatal error: sync: unlock of unlocked mutex\".\r\n\r\n```\r\nfatal error: sync: unlock of unlocked mutex\r\n\r\ngoroutine 454070

don't know what the code is doing here.. but seems like we're having the same issue under different circumstances? I'm going to update my previous post with what is happening in my case. \r\nI think Telegram downloads don't rename files and download the files \"as they are\".\r\n\r\nThank you very much for everything.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** After resetting the NAS and reconfiguring a new share I've downloaded 20 files without problems... I can't confirm that, but seems like if you download and delete a file from Google Drive it is still preserved somehow in the file system. If you download the same file you deleted before, the crash appears. So changing the dowload destination folder for the file seems to have made a difference.
