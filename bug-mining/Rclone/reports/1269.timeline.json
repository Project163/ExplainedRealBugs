We've built our mapper to detect the values `drive` and `onedrive` so the appropriate mapping logic can be invoked, returning to rclone a JSON object compatible with the target.\r\n\r\nIn some cases (e.g., a Google doc), `SrcFsType` is set to an unexpected value like `object.memoryFs`, and we don't handle that type. I could further inspect the object to look for something like `content-type` and infer that a value of `application/vnd.google-apps.document` means a `drive` backend, but I'd have to identify and maintain a list of content types to look for. I'm also not sure if `object.memoryFs` is the only oddball value I need to recognize.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.67.0-beta.7957.625622bcb.fix-onedrive-metadata\r\n- os/version: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 23H2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 10.0.22631.3527 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: windows\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.22.3\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nWindows 11, 64-bit\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
