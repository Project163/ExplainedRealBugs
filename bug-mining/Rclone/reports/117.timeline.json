for the clarification, ncw.  Sounds as though they're considering enhancing the API to allow it - here's hoping they do...\n\nI do understand the point that file mod time isn't a generally robust way to detect whether files need to be sync'd, as it's independent of file content.  (From what I see in the man page, rclone normally does use mtime (and size) to detect changes, which is good enough for my current use case.  Unfortunately MD5SUMs aren't an option for Dropbox either, apparently.)

However dropbox has a bug which means when you update a file and **only** change the client_modified, it doesn't actually change the client modified :-(  Dropbox assumes the file is the same I think.\r\n\r\nNormally rclone works around this by deleting the file first when it wants to update the modification time.\r\n\r\nSo either do the sync without `-u --no-update-modtime` or delete the offending file
