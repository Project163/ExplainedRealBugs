What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nI believe there are two ways to use rclone: \r\n- interactively, using config, possibly with config password\r\n- in pure cli mode, using `--b2-account` etc. long options\r\n\r\nRight now, if there is a config password set, it breaks pure cli mode.\r\n\r\nWith no config:\r\n```\r\nrclone lsd --b2-account x --b2-key y :b2:\r\n```\r\nworks\r\n\r\nWith config, the same command breaks with `Enter configuration password:` prompt. \r\n\r\nIf I try a workaround and specify `--ask-password=false`, it still doesn't work, terminating in \r\n```\r\nunable to decrypt configuration and not allowed to ask for password - set RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS to your configuration password\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means, that it is not possible to develop rclone cli scripts on a dev machine with config set. \r\nI always have to rename the config folder before and after testing such scripts.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.45\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nmacOS 10.14.2\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nBackblaze B2, but I believe it's not relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nNothing except arg parsing.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2879/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/800169122","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5125#issuecomment-800169122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5125","id":800169122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDE2OTEyMg==","user":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-16T11:12:06Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T11:12:06Z","body":"as
