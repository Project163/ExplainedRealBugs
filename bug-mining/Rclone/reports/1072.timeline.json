single configurable parameter such as `--union-min-free-space 1G` would be the most simple version to accomplish at least my use case. I am not familiar with how either rclone or mergerfs works on the backend so I'll add some ideas here that may not make sense or not feasible. \r\nFrom reading other challenging things about storing on remotes, determining if they're full or when they're going to be full is a difficult task. Another way to accomplish the same thing would be to have a property of the remote during config. That property would be a `min-free-space` threshold. This would allow you to configure each remote rather than the union. It would be the same comparison to check the remotes' free space to it's threshold. \r\nHaving extra configurability is always nice but I can't think of a use case where each drive being configured vs one parameter for all remotes adds any real benefit. If someone is using a union, they are intending on treating it as one big drive and therefore probably don't care about each individual drive. \r\n\r\nObviously this `min-free-space` parameter is only useful as long as the value is larger than your largest file you are storing. From the little bit I understand, the issue only occurs during the initial write to the remote because after that the existing eplfs rule of writing until it's full will take over. \r\n\r\nSo in summary, I agree that a single configurable parameter to apply to all remotes in a union would suffice. This would be a great improvement for anyone who's storing small files like documents or pictures.

That was a result of trying different policies in an attempt to find one that works for what I need. \r\nHowever I installed the beta branch you linked, I tested the new parameter using lfs policy and it's worked exactly as expected. I first ran it without the new parameter. It filled up one of the 15G drives and then errored about the storage drive being full. \r\nI added the parameter `--union-min-free-space 50M` because all my files are 50M or smaller and it worked perfectly.
