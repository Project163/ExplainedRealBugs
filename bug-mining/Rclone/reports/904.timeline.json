:-) We understand you are having a problem with rclone; we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum:\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\ninstead of filing an issue for a quick response.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.

Running the command `lsof -c rclone | wc -l` yields 1029 (this is the max. I guess). In the list printed by `lsof -c rclone`, most protocols are of type 'can't identify protocol'\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.43.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nWindows 10 64 bit using Linux subsystem\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
