What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nBecause my NAS (Synology) does not support OneDrive for storing backups (HyperBackup), i want use rclone as a \"proxy\" for storing backup data because the backup software does support webdav.\r\nFor that I start serve webdav with:\r\n```\r\nrclone serve webdav --addr 127.0.0.1:8090 onedrive:\r\n```\r\nSo far, i works for a time but then I got a error from rclone:\r\n```\r\n2019/04/24 21:16:08 ERROR : Hyper Backup/nas-h01.hbk/Pool/0/0/156.bucket.2: Failed to copy: invalidRange: fragmentOverlap: The uploaded fragment overlaps with data
