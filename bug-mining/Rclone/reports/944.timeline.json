If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the changes here\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd some documentation of the configuration file format, without going too much into details.\r\n\r\nSeems rclone currently uses https://github.com/unknwon/goconfig library for handling the configuration file, but not mentioning this in the doc, as I guess it may change over time - and that one is actually documented as being sort of deprecated (\"under bug fix only mode, which means no more features will be added\").\r\n\r\nI am linking to https://rclone.org/overview/ for list of backend \"types\", but it does not show the internal \"codename\" for the backends that must be put as value of the `type` key in config file. Command `rclone help backends` seems to show these type values. Perhaps the overview page should have listed them as well?\r\n\r\nAdded an example, used mega because I found that supported plain username/password auth, which makes it a simpler example than tokens etc..\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#572\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have
