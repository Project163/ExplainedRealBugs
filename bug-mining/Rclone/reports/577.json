This works well.\r\n\r\nMy problem is, that if the sync command creates the bucket (silently), then it becomes a public listable bucket when using `--s3-acl=public-read` for the synced files.\r\n\r\nThere are two concepts here, which are somehow mixed with rclone sync.\r\n- bucket's policy\r\n- the different files' policy within the bucket.\r\n\r\nI believe a sync command's --s3-acl=public-read should only apply to the uploaded files.\r\nI personally think that sync shouldn't create buckets, but that's probably a historical decision in rclone and will never change for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nI don't know what would be the best solution now, but at least printing a line about \"Creating public readable bucket: {bucketname}\" would be very important, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.45\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nmacOS 10.14.2\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
