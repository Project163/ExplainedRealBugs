However, only h and below seem to work. In the command below, if I change 1d to 24h the problem is resolved. Just letting you know the documentation and the functionality don't match.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.60.0\r\n- os/version: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro 22H2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 10.0.22621.674 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: windows\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.19.2\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n```\r\nWindows 11 Pro 22H2 (64 bit)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
