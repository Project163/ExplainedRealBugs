noticed while debugging azureblob recently that it doesn't support `-vv --dump headers`.  This is because It doesn't use [rclone's http Transport](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/7f0b2042925b88c0f510df15026fdb1f7b5a8601/fs/fshttp/http.go#L118) like it should be.\r\n\r\nI couldn't figure out how to add it immediately so [I asked a question](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/issues/79) on how to and I received this reply\r\n\r\n> Yes, it is possible to do. We do consider it a more advanced scenario. You can see an example of us doing it with our AzCopy utility [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-azcopy/blob/f967afe7fdf05b42e376abafff4d65bee295514a/ste/mgr-JobPartMgr.go#L65).\r\n> \r\n> Basically, you have to call pipeline package's NewPipeline function passing in pipeline.Options after setting the HTTPSender field to the desired httpClient/transport you desire. NewPipeline also requires a slice of pipeline.Factory objects (which are also completely customizable but considered an advanced scenario) to manually configure pipeline policies such as telemetry, request IDs, credentials, retries, logging, etc. azblob's NewPipeline [function](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go/blob/67440baa31716bc29c9d0c48b1653f9afad3909b/2017-07-29/azblob/zc_pipeline.go) does this for you to address the common user case. You do NOT have to call azblob's NewPipeline to create a pipeline, you can manually create a pipeline to have more control over it.\r\n\r\nIt looks moderately complicated though!\r\n\r\n@sandeepkru do you fancy having a go at this?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
