Pretty straight forward, a flag you can set to stop uploading at say 100GB. rclone will finish it's current uploads once that target is reached but will not take any more work, then close the session. Since it tracks total upload anyway, I think it would be a really easy thing to do. If no one else is interested, I can fork and write it for testing. But this should be a simple feature for someone already familiar with the code. I have a 1TB per month (soft) limit with my ISP, and I would rather keep them out of my business, so being able to control the amount uploaded would be nice. \r\n\r\nAlso, while we're at it, a time based limit as well. I've seen that request before. If you could set something to only upload for 3 hours for example. That way with crontab (or the like) you could control the exact times your uploading. Should also be easy since total time is also already tracked. \r\n \r\nBiggest advantage is that currently if I want to cut it off, I have to of course kill it once my target time/size is reached. So I lose the current files it's uploading, and risk maybe leaving things in a funky state. I'm confident rclone will fix that on the next copy/sync, but it's a hacky way of imposing limits. I'd rather just be able to set them when I run it. With total limits, and bandwidth limits that are already in place, I could for example just set my big directory's to upload 750GB, at a low bandwidth limit, then just let it run all month till it hit the target. Then do it again next month. And I never have to worry about blowing my ISP's limits. \r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/985/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
