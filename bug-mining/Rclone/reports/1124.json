Encrypted libraries in Seafile are only decrypted in a web browser for 1 hour until you need to input the encrypted password again, seems like this unfortunately also affects rclone.\r\n\r\nhttps://help.seafile.com/security_and_encryption/use_encrypted_libraries/\r\n- If you use web app, you have to input the password to the server. The server will cache the password in encrypted format for 1 hour. It won't store the password on disk.\r\n\r\nI haven't found out a way to increase this 1 hour limit on the Seafile server-side, except not using an encrypted library. However I want to use an encrypted library to transfer my files into.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, after exactly an hours of successfully syncing files without any issues (except a few one-byte-off transfers, which are probably fixed by re-sync if the sync didn't stop after 1 hour), the following errors show up after about 1 minute timeout for every file still not transferred:\r\n```\r\nDec 30 10:48:52 rclone rclone[56954]: file1: Failed to copy: internal server error during file upload\r\nDec 30 10:49:02 rclone rclone[56954]: file2: Failed to copy: internal server error during file upload\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\n# rclone --version\r\nrclone v1.59.2-DEV\r\n- os/version: freebsd 13.1-release-p2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 13.1-release-p2 (amd64)\r\n- os/type: freebsd\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.19.2\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n```\r\nFreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE-p5, in an iocage jail on TrueNAS-13.0-U3\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
