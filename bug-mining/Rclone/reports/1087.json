Sadly this is a dependency update commit which makes it a lot harder to judge what change caused this.\r\nVLC still finds the files via the server, so this is some weird interaction between something that changed in this commit and how LG WebOS expects a DLNA server to behave. I don't see a dependency that contains `DLNA` in the name, but if someone tells me likely candidates that could have caused this I can check those too, and then open an issue with that project if applicable.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nThis is with the release from Github\r\n```\r\n$ rclone-v1.59.0-linux-amd64/rclone version\r\nrclone v1.59.0\r\n- os/version: arch \"rolling\" (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.18.14-arch1-1 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.18.3\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\narch \"rolling\" (64 bit)\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
