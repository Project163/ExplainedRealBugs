I'm also interested in submitting a PR for this myself.\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n1.68.0\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nWhen only copying and not fully syncing files, i.e. not deleting anything at the destination, getting a nicely structured list of all the files that were transferred and why they were transferred would be useful for housekeeping purposes and for keeping track of how an operation changed the destination.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nThe following flags to the `rclone copy` command with the same behavior as for `rclone sync` should be introduced:\r\n * `--combined`\r\n * `--differ`\r\n * `--match`\r\n * `--missing-on-dst`\r\n\r\n`--missing-on-src` and `--dest-after` can also be supported, but their behavior when combined with `--no-traverse` should be documented and a warning logged if both a logging flag and `--no-traverse` is specified.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
