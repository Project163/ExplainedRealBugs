file with `Create` with flags `O_RDWR|O_CREATE|O_EXCL`. However explorer didn't write to the file so there was no need to truncate it.\r\n\r\nI've attempted to fix this

Then, probably as a potential destination, tries to open it again with `CREATE_NEW`, which fails with `NAME COLLISION` as result. Then it tries with a new name, autogenerated suffix \"- Copy\" to basename, and succeeds with `CREATE_NEW` and ends up writing copied content to that.\r\n\r\nVery interesting.\r\n\r\nThat CREATE_NEW gets transalated to` CreateEx` with flags `O_RDWR|O_CREATE|O_EXCL`. Now that you've explained it, I can see what was supposed to happen and what wasn't happening before. the `O_EXCL` flag is not supposed to allow a creation if the file already exists - hence the `NAME_COLLISION`. What was happening before the fix was that the file got created and truncated.\r\n\r\nAfter the fix this happens\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021/03/31 16:46:38 DEBUG : /file.txt: CreateEx: flags=0x502, mode=0700\r\n2021/03/31 16:46:38 DEBUG : file.txt: Open: flags=O_RDWR|O_CREATE|O_EXCL, file=0xc000139b00\r\n2021/03/31 16:46:38 DEBUG : file.txt: newRWFileHandle: file=0xc000139b00,

significance of the `O_EXCL` before - it all makes sense now!\r\n\r\nI've put this patch through the VFS torture test and it seems OK so I'm going to merge it now.\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of building the 1.55 release so that will be the last patch in 1.55.\r\n\r\nIf it needs fixing up it can go in v1.55.1\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/811173010/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4535718079,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDUzNTcxODA3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4535718079","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"20e15e52a9d79c5ceb3b9008ca7bb16bc13c0853","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/20e15e52a9d79c5ceb3b9008ca7bb16bc13c0853","created_at":"2021-03-31T15:59:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4535775500,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50NDUzNTc3NTUwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4535775500","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-31T16:09:05Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.56"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4535775503,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQ1MzU3NzU1MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4535775503","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-31T16:09:05Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.55"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5153937454,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU
