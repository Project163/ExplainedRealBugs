If I wrote the arguments in the error message that would at least give you a clue.\r\n\r\nI've improved the error message slightly\r\n\r\n    Command sync needs 2 arguments maximum: you provided 3 non flag arguments: [\"false\" \".\" \":crypt:\"]\r\n\r\nI've also added a bit of text to the docs\r\n\r\nOptions that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways, `--option=value` or `--option value`. However boolean (true/false) options behave slightly differently to the other options in that\r\n`--boolean` sets the option to `true` and the absence of the flag sets it to `false`.  It is also possible to specify `--boolean=false` or `--boolean=true`.  Note that `--boolean false` is not valid - this is parsed as `--boolean` and the `false` is parsed as an extra command line argument for rclone.\r\n\r\nWhich should hopefully address your concerns :-)\r\n\r\n> Otherwise, thanks for this amazing and stable piece of software, I'm migrating more and more vendor specific CLIs to rclone and it's working really well!\r\n\r\nYou are welcome - and great - that is exactly what rclone is for!
