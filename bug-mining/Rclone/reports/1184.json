However, while the ssh command itself works without SSH_AUTH_SOCK set, rclone aborts with the message\r\nFailed to create file system for \"systemname:/\": couldn't connect to ssh-agent: SSH agent requested but SSH_AUTH_SOCK not-specified\r\nWhich shouldn't be relevant in the case that external ssh is used.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.64.0-DEV\r\n- os/version: rocky 9.2 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.14.0-284.18.1.el9_2.x86_64 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.20.4\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nrocky linux 9.2 64bit\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
