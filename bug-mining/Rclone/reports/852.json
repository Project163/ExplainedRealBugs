reported here: https://forum.rclone.org/t/possible-issue-with-encrypted-chunker-chunker-crypt-remote/18920\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nI was testing out encrypted chunking, and it seems that `chunker ->  crypt -> remote` fails, while `crypt -> chunker -> remote` succeeds. I'd like to use the former, since it hides the chunked filenames too, as mentioned in this forum post: https://forum.rclone.org/t/encrypted-chunker/12720.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.53.0-DEV\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried it with the latest beta as well, and the issue persists:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.54.0-beta.4751.4a001b8a0\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nMacOS Catalina - 10.15.6, 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nTesting with local filesystem. Also verified that it has the same issue with Google Drive as a remote.\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)  \r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone -vv sync /tmp/input.4800 test-chunk-chunker:\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The rclone config contents with secrets removed.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n[test-chunk-crypt]\r\ntype = crypt\r\nremote = /tmp/mytestdir/\r\nfilename_encryption = standard\r\ndirectory_name_encryption = true\r\npassword = REDACTED\r\n\r\n[test-chunk-chunker]\r\ntype = chunker\r\nremote = test-chunk-crypt:\r\nchunk_size = 2k\r\nhash_type = sha1\r\nname_format = *.rcc.###\r\nfail_hard = true\r\n\r\n[test-chunk-chunklast]\r\ntype = chunker\r\nremote = /tmp/mychunklastdir/\r\nchunk_size = 2k\r\nhash_type = sha1\r\nname_format = *.rcc.###\r\nfail_hard = true\r\n\r\n[test-chunk-cryptfirst]\r\ntype = crypt\r\nremote = test-chunk-chunklast:\r\npassword = REDACTED\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag  \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Create a 4800 byte file.\r\n$ ruby -e 'puts(\"0123456789abcde\\n\" * 300)' >input.4800\r\n\r\n$ rclone -vv sync /tmp/input.4800 test-chunk-chunker:\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:26 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.53.0-DEV\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"-vvv\" \"sync\" \"/tmp/input.4800\" \"test-chunk-chunker:\"]\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:26 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/input.4800\"\r\nEnter configuration password:\r\npassword:\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:29 DEBUG : Using config file from \"/home/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\"\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:29 DEBUG : fs cache: adding new entry for parent of \"/tmp/input.4800\", \"/tmp\"\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:29 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"test-chunk-chunker:\"\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:29 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"test-chunk-crypt:\"\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:29 DEBUG : Creating backend with remote \"/tmp/mytestdir/\"\r\n2020/09/05 10:41:29 DEBUG : input.4800: Need to transfer -
