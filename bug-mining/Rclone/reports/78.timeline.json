I have to run the command mkdir on the subdirectory before it can be purged.\n\nHow did you originally create the folders.  Can you give an example so I can reproduce the problem?\n\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:54 Attempt 1/3 failed with 2 errors and: Container Not Empty\n> 2015/10/13 03:49:54 Waiting for deletions to finish\n\nYes, I think that is a bug.  It shouldn't be attempting to delete the container if you are using a sub-directory.  The same bug is probably in `s3` and `google cloud storage`!\n\n> EDIT: Those issues seem to be related to the way my Swift provider is managing directories. I get a third issue when using ./rclone sync swift:container/sub local. Directories in sub are created as 0-byte-files (and I get errors for all files in those directories).\n\nThat is the old style way of creating pseudo directories in swift.  I thought rclone ignored them, but checking the code apparently it doesn't, so that is probably a bug.\n\nHow did you create those directories? Using the swift tool?\n\nWho is your provider? And which version of Swift or Openstack are you using?\n\nThanks\n\nNick\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/147688926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":433917141,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQzMzkxNzE0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/433917141","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-13T11:26:39Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/147752546","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/172#issuecomment-147752546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/172","id":147752546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0Nzc1MjU0Ng==","user":{"login":"axtux","id":622438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMjQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/622438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux","html_url":"https://github.com/axtux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axtux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-13T15:34:40Z","updated_at":"2015-10-13T15:34:40Z","body":"My provider is Hubic (from OVH) and I'm creating folders from their client.
