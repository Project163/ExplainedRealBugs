Create a text file with one character in it.\r\n2. Wait until files are synchronised.\r\n3. Wait for a period of time larger than `--max-window`.\r\n4. Modify the file modification time without modifying the content.\r\n5. Sync using rclone.\r\n6. Sync again to see it being re-uploaded.\r\nNote that the modification time shown on the Dropbox web interface will not change after synchronisation using rclone.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version\r\nProblem is reproducible on both rclone stable v1.40 and rclone beta.\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.40-045-g0358e9e7\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.10\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits\r\nWindows 7 SP1, 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?\r\nDropbox\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run\r\nPlease refer to the log below.\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag\r\n```\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:51 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.40-045-g0358e9e7\" starting with parameters [\"<omitted>\\\\rclone\\\\rclone.exe\" \"sync\" \"-vv\" \"--checkers=2\" \"--config\" \"cf\" \"--delete-during\" \"--modify-window=2m\" \"--stats=5s\" \"--transfers=2\" \"--verbose\" \"C:\\\\Users\\\\<omitted>\\\\Dropbox\\\\Test\" \"<omitted>:Test\"]\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:51 DEBUG : Using config file from \"<omitted>\"\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:52 INFO  : Dropbox root 'Test': Modify window is 2m0s\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:52 INFO  : Waiting for deletions to finish\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:53 DEBUG : a.txt: Modification times differ by -3m39.4866604s:\r\n2018-04-06 15:27:46.4866604 +0800 +08, 2018-04-06 07:24:07 +0000 UTC\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:53 INFO  : Dropbox root 'Test': Waiting for checks to finish\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:53 DEBUG : a.txt: src and dst identical but can't set mod time without re-uploading\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:53 INFO  : Dropbox root 'Test': Waiting for transfers to finish\r\n\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:54 INFO  : a.txt: Copied (replaced existing)\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:54 INFO  :\r\nTransferred:      1 Bytes (0 Bytes/s)\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:                 1\r\nTransferred:            1\r\nElapsed time:       19.7s\r\n\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:54 DEBUG : 6 go routines active\r\n2018/04/06 15:35:54 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.40-045-g0358e9e7\" finishing with parameters [\"<omitted>\\\\rclone\\\\rclone.exe\" \"sync\" \"-vv\" \"--checkers=2\" \"--config\" \"cf\" \"--delete-during\" \"--modify-window=2m\" \"--stats=5s\" \"--transfers=2\" \"--verbose\" \"C:\\\\Users\\\\<omitted>\\\\Dropbox\\\\Test\" \"<omitted>:Test\"]\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
