What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nMain purpose of this PR is to fix/improve the handling of `Default`, `Exclusive` and `Required` properties of multiple-choice options. Does also include some additional improvements around the config ui, fixes and nitpicks discovered during development, such as default value prompting (not only for multiple-choice), required password editing, several prompting/spelling tweaks etc.\r\n\r\n**Fix handling of default, exclusive and required properties**\r\n\r\nPreviously an empty input (just pressing enter) was only allowed for multiple-choice options that did not have the Exclusive property set. Here is an example session with an exclusive multiple-choice option:\r\n```\r\nOption config_type.\r\nAuthentication type\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"standard\").\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in an existing value.\r\n   / Standard authentication.\r\n 1 | Use this if you're a normal Jottacloud user.\r\n   \\ \"standard\"\r\n   / Legacy authentication.\r\n 2 | This is only required for certain whitelabel versions of Jottacloud and not recommended for normal users.\r\n   \\ \"legacy\"\r\n   / Telia Cloud authentication.\r\n 3 | Use this if you are using Telia Cloud.\r\n   \\ \"telia\"\r\nconfig_type>\r\nconfig_type>\r\nconfig_type>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change the existing `Required` property is introduced into the multiple choice handling, so that one can have `Exclusive` and `Required` options where only a value from the list is allowed, and one can have `Exclusive` but not `Required` options where an empty value is accepted but any non-empty value must still be matching an item from the list. And, as before, a multiple choice that is neither `Exclusive` nor `Required`, where any input is accepted.\r\n\r\nSome notes about `Required`:\r\n- The `Required` property means the option must have a value, but it can be explicitely set or it can be an implicit default.\r\n- This means that when there is a default value, that is not an empty string, then setting `Required: true` makes no difference.\r\n- When there is no default value, setting `Required: true` means user have to supply a value, cannot simply press Enter.\r\n- This interpretation did not change with this PR, that was how it was done for free-text input already, but the same logic was introduced for multiple-choice inputs as well.\r\n\r\nNote that there are several combinations of properties that will achieve the same: `Exclusive` and `Required` boolean properties set true or false, `Default` value set or not set (nil, treated as empty string), and in addition one can have empty string (`\"\"`) as an entry in the multiple-choice list. Not something that is directly intentional, but more of a consequence, backwards compat etc. The way to achieve the different behavior can be summarized:\r\n- If only values from the specified list should be allowed: `Exclusive=true && Required=true && Default=\"\"`\r\n   - \"Exclusive and Required, with no Default\"\r\n- If empty string and values from specified list should be allowed: `Exclusive=true && (Required=false || Default!=\"\")`\r\n   - \"Exclusive, and not Required or a Default\"\r\n- If anything but empty string should be allowed: `Exclusive=false && Required=true && Default==\"\"`\r\n   - \"Required, but not Exclusive and no Default\"\r\n- If anything should be allowed: `Exclusive=false && Required=false`\r\n   - \"Not Required and not Exclusive\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the recommended approach is: For multiple-choice option do specify `Examples`, and then:\r\n- The default behavior is to allow any value, either from specified examples, or any other value. To restrict exclusively to the specified examples, set `Exclusive=true`.\r\n- If empty string should not be allowed then set `Required=true`, and do not set `Default` (leave it at `nil`).\r\n\r\n**Press Enter for the default**\r\n\r\nA related issue is the misleading description `Press Enter for the default (\"\")`, as can be seen from example above. This is also an issue for regular free-text (non-multiple-choice) input, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nFTP host to connect to\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own value\r\n 1 / Connect to ftp.example.com\r\n   \\ \"ftp.example.com\"\r\nhost>\r\nThis value is required and it has no default.\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own value\r\n 1 / Connect to ftp.example.com\r\n   \\ \"ftp.example.com\"\r\nhost>\r\n```\r\nThis was also fixed, now the message `Press Enter for the default (\"standard\").` will only be shown when this is actually allowed.\r\n\r\n**Quoting of values in prompt**\r\n\r\nPreviously the default and multiple choice values were always shown in quotes. For strictly numeric values, e.g. port number, this instinctively seemed wrong (at least with the `FTP port, leave blank to use default (21)` case, described later). So I tried a quick change in the code code to only quote values that are string types. E.g. instead of:\r\n```\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"standard\").\r\nEnter a signed integer. Press Enter for the default (\"21\").\r\n```\r\nThen:\r\n```\r\nEnter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"standard\").\r\nEnter a signed integer. Press Enter for the default (21).\r\n```\r\nBut then there are other types of values which are not strings, but not simple value types either:\r\n```\r\nEnter a size with suffix K,M,G,T. Press Enter for the default (10Mi).\r\nEnter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default (false).\r\nEnter a encoder.MultiEncoder value. Press Enter for the default (Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot).\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that made me think: The input that user enters in the config ui is not programming language / go syntax. When entering string the user should not surround it by quotes. So just as a number input is `21` a string input is also just `this is a string`.\r\n\r\nThe code that is printing default value is converting it to a string and then using the format verb `%q`, which prints it *safely escaped with Go syntax*. This means surrounded by quotes, but also that `\\` is escaped to `\\\\`, `\"` to `\\\"` etc. This is different from the actual input the user should enter.\r\n\r\nExample where rclone is printing default value with `%q`, an option where default is current username with domain prefix:\r\n- When default value is printed with `%q` it is escaped like this:\r\n  ```\r\n  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"domain\\\\user\").\r\n  ```\r\n- But if a user then were to enter his own value in the same format:\r\n  ```\r\n  user>domain\\\\otheruser\r\n  ```\r\n  Then it would be stored in the config file as `domain\\\\otheruser`, and when read back this will be escaped into string `\"domain\\\\\\\\otheruser\"`. This can be observed if editing the config, then the default will be the value from config,\r\n  again formatted with `%q`:\r\n  ```\r\n  Press Enter for the default (\"domain\\\\\\\\otheruser\").\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true for multiple-choice options, where rclone is printing the \"example\" values with `%q`:\r\n  ```\r\n  Username\r\n  Choose a number from below, or type in your own string value.\r\n  Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\n   1 / Current user\r\n     \\ \"domain\\\\user\"\r\n   2 / This is \"me\", yes it is\r\n     | More text here\r\n     \\ \"mini \\\"me\\\" is me\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nAn improvement could be to print the string values with `%s` or `%v` instead of `%q`:\r\n  ```\r\n  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (some standard value).\r\n  ```\r\nAnother variant is to manually add quotes around, `fmt.Sprintf(\"\\\"%s\\\"\", v)` to get\r\nquotes without escaping:\r\n  ```\r\n  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"some standard value\").\r\n  ```\r\nBut then if the original value contains escaped quotes, although not very likely, this will look wrong:\r\n  ```\r\n  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"some \"quoted\" value\").\r\n  ```\r\nSo I'm thinking it is best just to print the value without quotes or anything: Everything between `(` and `)` is exactly as the user would have to write it! ...Although same thing here if original value contains parens as well, but parens within parens maybe does not look *that* wrong as with quotes within quotes? Regardless, the main purpose with no quoting and just parens, is it looks a bit cleaner, to avoid confusion with regards to if values containing spaces must be quoted or not, less targeted at programmers and more at end-users.. I don't know. Thats the idea, at least.. :)\r\n\r\nBut then for non-required options without a default value, the current version prompts:\r\n```\r\nPress Enter for the default (\"\").\r\n```\r\nWith the change above this would look worse:\r\n```\r\nPress Enter for the default ().\r\n```\r\nBut can easily consider this in code, so that this case is instead shown as:\r\n```\r\nPress Enter to leave empty.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(not sure if it should say \"to leave empty\", or \"to skip\" or \"not set\" or something like that instead?)\r\n\r\nBut then when it comes to how multiple-choice are prompted, the option value for each choice are in a section together with the help text today, and not separated in the same way as the default values described above. Currently:\r\n```\r\n   2 / This is \"me\", yes it is\r\n     | More text here\r\n     \\ \"this \\\"me\\\" is not really me\"\r\n```\r\nBut perhaps we can just do the same here - plain string (content), and add parenthesis to separate from help text:\r\n```\r\n   2 / This is \"me\", yes it is\r\n     | More text here\r\n     \\ (this \"me\" is not really me)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is what I have done, so the \"look\" will be a bit different - notice the values in parenthesis:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType of storage to configure.\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own string value.\r\n 1 / 1Fichier\r\n   \\ (fichier)\r\n 2 / Alias for an existing remote\r\n   \\ (alias)\r\n 3 / Amazon Drive\r\n   \\ (amazon cloud drive)\r\nStorage>\r\n\r\nHost to connect to\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own string value.\r\n 1 / Connect to ftp.example.com\r\n   \\ (ftp.example.com)\r\nhost>\r\n\r\nUsername\r\nPress Enter for the default (domain\\user).\r\nuser>\r\n\r\nPort\r\nPress Enter for the default (21).\r\nport>\r\n\r\nUsername2\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in your own string value.\r\nPress Enter to leave empty.\r\n 1 / Current user\r\n   \\ (domain\\user)\r\n   / This is \"me\", yes it is\r\n 2 | Here we go with more text\r\n   \\ (this \"me\" is not really me)\r\n 3 / This is an empty choice\r\n   \\ ()\r\nuser2>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(The choice 3 in the last example still shows an empty `()`. This is a very special case where the multiple choice list have an explicit entry with value empty string. Rarely used, and is a bit confusing compared to the Default, Required etc discussed above, but I have seen it. Left it just printing `()` for now, have not come up with a better option yet).\r\n\r\n**Fixed edit of required password**\r\n\r\nAnother related issue is in the process of editing existing remotes, where there is a password. The editing process was changed in v1.56 from a separate edit workflow:\r\n```\r\nValue \"port\" = \"2222\"\r\nEdit? (y/n)>\r\ny) Yes\r\nn) No (default)\r\n```\r\n..into making edit being more like the initial create - just with existing values as default. This lead to a regression for required password inputs, as reported here: https://forum.rclone.org/t/v1-56-beta-i-have-to-re-enter-the-password-when-editing-the-remote/26437. Fixed this by making password input handle the `Default` property of options, in addition to `Required`, the same way as other option types. When editing the existing value will be the default value, and user gets the additional choice `n` to keep existing/default in addition to `y` and `g`:\r\n```\r\nFTP password\r\ny) Yes, type in my own password\r\ng) Generate random password\r\nn) No, keep existing (default)\r\n```\r\nPS: The changes in the edit process introduced in v1.56 came with the following commits:\r\n   https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/296ceadda61b82fe47e22e71ca85d01b00dc7c67#diff-d43e96d17fe826ebacb1c626935c1ced77f6c508a47cd7fa19832eb724c473c2\r\n   https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/77cda6773ca6d46d95e7e63f0d6b2be93ce81af3#diff-d43e96d17fe826ebacb1c626935c1ced77f6c508a47cd7fa19832eb724c473c2\r\n\r\n**Additional improvements to config ui prompts:**\r\n\r\n- Moved the code for input of the three types, free-text, password and multiple-choice, into separate functions, and made their prompting a bit mot tailor-made.\r\n- Improved \"title\" for multiple-choice options, especially the ones without default:\r\n    ```\r\n    Enter a string value.\r\n    Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value\r\n    ```\r\n    Now:\r\n    ```\r\n    Choose a number from below, or type in an existing string value.\r\n    ```\r\n- Improved feedback on wrong input: Print message such as `This value is required and it has no default.` and then a new \"prompt\" such as `my_option>`, also for multiple-choice options (consistent for all option types):\r\n    ```\r\n    Choose a number from below, or type in your own string value.\r\n     1 / Rclone should act on behalf of a user.\r\n       \\ \"user\"\r\n     2 / Rclone should act on behalf of a service account.\r\n       \\ \"enterprise\"\r\n    my_option>\r\n    This value is required and it has no default.\r\n    my_option>\r\n    This value is required and it has no default.\r\n    my_option>\r\n    ```\r\n    Previously it would, depending on error, whether free-text input or multiple-choice etc, either just repeat the prompt as in the initial example at the top or repeat the entire \"question\" with description (and choices) as the second example with ftp host input.\r\n- Made ftp and ssh port and username option default values explicit, using `Default` property.\r\n  - This avoids a prompt that would be repetative and confusing.\r\n  - When creating a ftp remote you get this question:\r\n  ```\r\n  FTP port, leave blank to use default (21)\r\n  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\n  port>\r\n  ```\r\n  If explicitely entering a port number, e.g. 2222, then when later editing the remote you get this question:\r\n  ```\r\n  FTP port, leave blank to use default (21)\r\n  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"2222\").\r\n  port>\r\n  ```\r\n  (as mentioned above I've removed the quoting around the \"2222\" value so with this change it would show `Press Enter for the \r\n  default (2222).`)\r\n\r\n  So default is 21, \"\", 2222, or what??\r\n\r\n  The explanation is that the help text of the ftp port option is defined as:\r\n  ```\r\n  Help: \"FTP port, leave blank to use default (21)\",\r\n  ```\r\n  So the \"leave blank to use default (21)\" was actually \"hard-coded\" in the help text. The ftp backend implementation will connect to port 21 when nothing else is specified - this is an *implicit* default. The option definition did not actually have a `Default` parameter, meaning it is `nil`. When the config ui prompts for this option during creation it will therefore add the description `Press Enter for the default (\"\").` When editing an existing remote, where the ftp option has a value explicitely set (e.g. 2222), then the existing value will be the option's `Default` parameter and therefore the prompt changes to `Press Enter for the default (\"2222\").`.\r\n  \r\n  Fixed by setting the `Default` property of the option, and removing the description of default from help text.\r\n  \r\n  Similar for username, where it would show:\r\n   ```\r\n  FTP username, leave blank for current username, DOMAIN\\user\r\n  Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default (\"\").\r\n  user>\r\n  ```\r\n  But now instead:\r\n  ```\r\n  FTP username\r\n  Press Enter for the default (DOMAIN\\user).\r\n  user>\r\n  ```\r\n- Includes some initial commits with minor cleanup done to make the main refactoring easier, but these did not end up being important for the solution (I can remove them if this is preferred):\r\n  - Removed explicit setting of defaults `Required: false` and `Default: \"\"`\r\n  - Removed setting `Required: true` when there is a `Default` value set.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Some issues and imperfections noticed but not fixed**\r\n\r\n- The datatype of options are decided by the type of the `Default` property, but if there is no default then the type is always referred to as string (`Enter a string value`), even if it naturally is an integer (like a port number).\r\n   - We could have introduced a new property `Type` that defines the value type expected, e.g. \"bool\" or \"string\". If this is not  specified we could check `Default` as before (backwards compat.).\r\n- When editing an existing remote that has set an explicit value for an option that has an implicit default, it is not possible to \"clear\" the value and get back to the implicit default. E.g. for ftp port number: Ftp backend will use port 21 if none is specified. Say an existing remote has this set to 2122. When editing this remote, to be able to use the default value 21 one have to explicit set it:\r\n  ```\r\n  FTP port, leave blank to use default (21)\r\n  Enter a signed integer. Press Enter for the default (2122).\r\n  port>\r\n  ```  \r\n  Empty input here (just pressing enter) will keep existing value 2122.\r\n- The question to edit advanced config is repeated when done with all advanced options, but could be intentional?\r\n  ```\r\n  Edit advanced config?\r\n  y) Yes\r\n  n) No (default)\r\n  y/n>\r\n  ```\r\n- Multiple choice options cannot take an integer as value! Any input entered by user that is convertible to integer will be treated as a number referencing the choice number. So if there are two choices then entering `2` will pick the second choice. Entering `999` will not pick any, but will be treated as a invalid choice because it there are no choices with that number. So if one had a multiple-choice option for configuring a port number, e.g. predefined values `1) 80`, `2) 8080`, `3) 8088`, but the option not being `Exclusive`, then entering 1, 2 or 3 would pick the corresponding predefined value, but entering 8 or 80 or 8888, would not be allowed, although that is supposed to be a way for the user to enter a custom port number.\r\n\r\n**TODO: Remaining**\r\n\r\nUpdate references to the interactive config prompts in documentation, to match the changes. Especially the example config session shown in most backend md docs.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #5549\r\nFixes #5562\r\n\r\nAlso fixes an issue reported in forum: https://forum.rclone.org/t/v1-56-beta-i-have-to-re-enter-the-password-when-editing-the-remote/26437\r\n\r\n**Also related to #5538, should probably merge that first (if accepted) and then fix up a few conflicts before merging this one.**\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution
