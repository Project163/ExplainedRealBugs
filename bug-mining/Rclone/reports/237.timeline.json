rather have the default `copy` command recognize that it is a file that is being copied, not a directory and thus treat the destination as file name, except when a `/` is the last character.\n\nExample:\n`rclone copy /path/to/file remote:dir/newfilename` puts file into dir, but renames it to _newfilename_.\n\n`rclone copy /path/to/file remote:dir/` puts file into dir.\n\nIn general, this should also apply to directories. This would change current rcopy syntax, though (as it always assumes trailing `/`), so I don't know if this is feasable. But rather now than later :)\nOtherwise, I'm also fine with a new command.\n\nHowever, I think this should also be supported for directories, so that we can upload a directory as another name.\nMaybe a flag for `copy` (and `sync` and all other commands) that treat the final path segment as destination name and not its parent folder might be better then? \n\n> PS note you could improve your script

new folder called hrm is created and atestfile is put in there, instead of just renaming the file to hrm.\nIs that intended? Seems quite odd. \n\nAlso just wondering how far in the roadmap is moving/renaming in mounts? Would make organizing a lot easier.\n\nUnfortunately since move isn't behaving the way I thought it would it doesn't seem possible to rename crypted files/folders at all. Since you can't really go to the amazon web ui and do that that way either as the file names are all encrypted.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":881120448,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg4MTEyMDQ0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/881120448","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c265f451f278b2d04f856af4dc2f4d524616e910","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/c265f451f278b2d04f856af4dc2f4d524616e910","created_at":"2016-12-03T23:45:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/264674764","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/227#issuecomment-264674764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/227","id":264674764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NDY3NDc2NA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-04T00:13:26Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T00:13:26Z","body":"I
