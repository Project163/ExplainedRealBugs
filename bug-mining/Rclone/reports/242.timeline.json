the `Copier` interface works as long as the file name is the same. All future renames will have to account for this and then maybe do an actual download+reupload to rename a \"copy\". I.e. this works differently from how hardlinks on POSIX filesystems work.\n\nAlso, to delete a file in multiple locations from one parent, you'd just have to remove that parent and leave the others. However, if you remove all parents from a file, it is instead attached to the _root_ of your ACD – regardless of where rclone's remote on ACD is located. I think the root folder id is then again present when you refresh the metadata, but I didn't check.\n\nEither way, implementing a proper copy is going to be leaky into all sorts of other

report all 1BN inodes as being used, Netdata is sending scary looking errors as a result. Things appear to be working, just, Netdata is having a fit.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 11 53 33 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/303add18-e86b-4255-ae39-37ba83b2dc78)\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nI was on v1.53.3-DEV and immediately recognized that could be the issue, so I updated to v1.68.1 and the issue did not change.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nUbuntu 22.04.5 LTS (jammy), 64-bit\r\ne.g.\r\nLinux pyron 5.15.0-112-generic #122-Ubuntu SMP Thu May 23 07:48:21 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
