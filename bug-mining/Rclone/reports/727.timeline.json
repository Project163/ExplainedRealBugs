made a prototype of this here\r\n\r\nI decided to give the flag a long name `--no-check-dest` as it is quite a difficult flag to use

--no-check-dest ###\r\n\r\nThe `--no-check-dest` can be used with `move` or `copy` and it causes\r\nrclone not to check the destination at all when copying files.\r\n\r\nThis means that:\r\n\r\n- the destination is not listed minimising the API calls\r\n- files are always transferred\r\n- this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (eg Google Drive)\r\n- `--retries 1` is recommended otherwise you'll transfer everything again on a retry\r\n\r\nThis flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none\r\nof the files are on the destination.\r\n\r\nThis is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/543262158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/544967159","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3616#issuecomment-544967159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3616","id":544967159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDk2NzE1OQ==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-22T13:40:17Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T13:40:17Z","body":"@manishgupta24
