\r\nHi I just came across this project and I am interested in contributing to the project and I find this issue a good start to get in. \r\n> You'll need to make `years` a method on `Fs` so it can read `f.opt.StartYear`\r\n\r\nWhen you say make `years` a method on `Fs`, do you mean to make years a method of interface Fs defined here?\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/ab895390f4b46f5455a508b1305a497026351a56/fs/fs.go#L254\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/546432051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"darkLord19","id":16662014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjYyMDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16662014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19","html_url":"https://github.com/darkLord19","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkLord19/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2744858722,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc0NDg1ODcyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2744858722","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-25T16:59:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2744858723,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NDQ4NTg3MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2744858723","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-25T16:59:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/546689730","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3630#issuecomment-546689730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3630","id":546689730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NjY4OTczMA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-27T12:27:08Z","updated_at":"2019-10-27T12:27:08Z","body":">
