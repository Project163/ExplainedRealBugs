Basically I get identical copy (with 'chunk_size = 1P' or similar). I want to use that 'md5all' thing, so my files I want to upload have md5 checksums pre-calculated before upload. That way the upload would be much faster (uploading to Jottacloud requires md5 checksum in advance).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```rclone v1.56.0```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nWindows 10, 64 bit\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\nLocal\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n```rclone copy local:D:\\Data local-chunk:D:\\Data-chunked --chunker-hash-type md5all -P --fast-list --transfers=1```\r\nThat is my pseudo command.\r\n\r\nFrom rclone config file (pseudo example):\r\n```\r\n[local]\r\ntype = local\r\nnounc = false\r\n\r\n[local-chunk]\r\ntype = chunker\r\nremote = local:\r\nchunk_size = 1P\r\nname_format = *.#\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nI think there is no need for the log as the problem is very obvious, clear and reproduceable (I think so).\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\nI hope there is enough information from my pseudo examples. The best thing would be if rclone could use md5 checksum files for that. NTFS file system don't store file checksums. It seems that similar feature is currently worked on and should be released with the next rclone version: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/949. I am really happy about that.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
