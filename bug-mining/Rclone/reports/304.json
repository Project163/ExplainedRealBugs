You then need to restore the config file from a backup if one exists, or set it up again.\r\n\r\nBit of an edge case but can be serious. Noticed because my Raspberry Pi only has 32gb and the file system quickly becomes full. Could cause loss of data if rclone is backing up to an encrypted remote and there is no backup of the config file.\r\n\r\nI'm using 1.34 and haven't tested it in 1.36, but this isn't really something I want to recreate as it means I have go through setup again and reorganise my Pi. Sorry if it has been fixed in newer versions.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1287/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
