I can then use command line argument `--config=<configfile>` or environment variable `set RCLONE_CONFIG=<configfile>`. But even if I do, rclone creates an empty directory `%USERPROFILE%\\.config\\rclone`. I find that I have to specify environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME to avoid this. When looking into the source file `fs/config/config.go` and function `makeConfigPath`, I'm wondering if this could be avoided with a minor code change: At [line 121](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/c6c74cb86992303fec6584c6e0561a0efae1a849/fs/config/config.go#L121-L128) it sets local variables xdgdir and xdgcfgdir based on the value of homedir, and then at [line 151](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/c6c74cb86992303fec6584c6e0561a0efae1a849/fs/config/config.go#L151-L157) it creates the actual folder path given by xdgcfgdir, before at line [167](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/c6c74cb86992303fec6584c6e0561a0efae1a849/fs/config/config.go#L167-L173) it checks for `--config` or `RCLONE_CONFIG`.. When user has specified `--config` or `RCLONE_CONFIG`, should this take priority so the logic searching for home and xdgdir can then just be skipped?","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
