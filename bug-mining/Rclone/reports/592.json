really appreciate [Mr. Craig-Wood](https://forum.rclone.org/u/ncw) suggestion at [rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/t/how-to-use-a-custom-ca-certificate/8676) to add the following three additional flags to deal with some authentication issues that HTTPS remotes may arise:\r\n\r\n    --ca-cert string          Client side certificate authority used to verify the server\r\n    --client-cert string      Client side SSL certificate PEM key (concatenation of certificate and CA certificate)\r\n    --client-key string       Client side SSL Private PEM key\r\n\r\nThe first one, `--ca-cert string`, would allow to use rclone with a HTTPS remote which uses a custom CA, or certificate, without having to use `--no-check-certificate` (which is a really bad idea and should only be used as a last resort), and without having to install any certificate on the system rclone would be executed (to keep this wonderful tool fully portable). \r\n\r\nThe other two of them, `--client-cert string` and `--client-key string`, would permit rclone to authenticate to the server with a custom SSL certificate, to improve the overall security scheme instead of using basic HTTP credentials.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2966/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
