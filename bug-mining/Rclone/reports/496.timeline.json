working.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/593110854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ecthiender","id":616387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNjM4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/616387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender","html_url":"https://github.com/ecthiender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecthiender/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3085654845,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA4NTY1NDg0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3085654845","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-01T15:38:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3085654846,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwODU2NTQ4NDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3085654846","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-01T15:38:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/593884696","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2449#issuecomment-593884696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2449","id":593884696,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Mzg4NDY5Ng==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-03T10:44:38Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T10:44:38Z","body":"@ecthiender

for replying! The `:backend:` will do the job for me. \r\n\r\nA minor concern, I have a script which uses rclone and recently it stopped working. And hence the comment above. Strange that you mention `--make-remote` never got merged, because my script uses `--make-remote` (and now it fails with no such flag error). FWIW, the script is 1-1.5 years old and used to work fine and used rclone from Arch Linux package repo. I don't run this script regularly, and probably that's why I recently found out about the error, when I tried to run it after a few months.

is closed, so I’ve put this here. Documentation on this was a real struggle for me. In the hopes this helps others, here’s an inline command to backup a DigitalOcean Spaces bucket locally to `./bucket`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrclone sync \\\r\n    --s3-provider=\"DigitalOcean\" \\\r\n    --s3-env-auth=\"false\" \\\r\n    --s3-access-key-id=$STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID \\\r\n    --s3-secret-access-key=$STORAGE_ACCESS_SECRET \\\r\n    --s3-endpoint=$STORAGE_ENDPOINT \\\r\n    --s3-acl=private \\\r\n    :s3:$STORAGE_BUCKET \\\r\n    “./bucket\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace the `$VARS` where appropriate. I’m not a fan of side-effect powdered code where it can be helped (i.e. `rclone.conf`), so making this more ‘functional’ was a deal breaker. It’s similar to having a`./rclone.conf` file like this:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n[spaces]\r\ntype=s3\r\nprovider=DigitalOcean\r\nenv_auth=false\r\naccess_key_id=$STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID\r\nsecret_access_key=$STORAGE_ACCESS_SECRET\r\nendpoint=$STORAGE_ENDPOINT\r\nacl=private\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then running a command like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone sync --config=./rclone.conf spaces:$STORAGE_BUCKET “./bucket\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also don’t like credentials stored in multiple locations on the system, so taking values from my existing `.env` file and pushing them in via flags was the only way. Don’t keep these env vars set in the system’s shell unless it’s in something like Docker.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1462259988/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WillSquire","id":6594713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTQ3MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6594713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire","html_url":"https://github.com/WillSquire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WillSquire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1943730918","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2449#issuecomment-1943730918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2449","id":1943730918,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5z2vrm","user":{"login":"narainaDewasi","id":119840036,"node_id":"U_kgDOBySdJA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119840036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi","html_url":"https://github.com/narainaDewasi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narainaDewasi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-14T13:04:54Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T13:04:54Z","body":"```shell\r\nrclone sync \\\r\n    --s3-provider=\"DigitalOcean\" \\\r\n    --s3-env-auth=\"false\" \\\r\n    --s3-access-key-id=$STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID \\\r\n    --s3-secret-access-key=$STORAGE_ACCESS_SECRET \\\r\n    --s3-endpoint=$STORAGE_ENDPOINT \\\r\n    --s3-acl=private \\\r\n    :s3:$STORAGE_BUCKET \\\r\n    “./bucket\"\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis is awesome!
