We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/min-age-and-max-age-support-for-atime-and-ctime/2122\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nWe would need use \"ctime\" on `rclone move` with filters (--max-age --min-age).\r\nIt appears that rclone only uses \"mtime\".\r\nThis is only needed when moving from local to remote (/local to remote:bucket).\r\n\r\n    Access Time (atime):\r\n        Represents the last time the file was accessed or read.\r\n        Updated when the file is opened or read.\r\n\r\n    Modify Time (mtime):\r\n        Represents the last time the file's content was modified or changed.\r\n        Updated when the file's content is altered.\r\n\r\n    Change Time (ctime):\r\n        Represents the last time the file's metadata was changed.\r\n        Updated when the file's metadata is modified (e.g., permissions are changed) or when the file is created or deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\ncreate a flag `--local-times mtime/ctime/atime` as @ncw already noted.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
