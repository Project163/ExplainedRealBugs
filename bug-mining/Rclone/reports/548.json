And i'm having chunked file upload.\r\n\r\nI understand that using vfs-cache-mode off makes file size detection harder, hence rclone is falling back quickly to chunk based upload (i could play with à 5Gb cutoff, but playing with memory is not so good)\r\n\r\nWhat i do not understand is that before writing to a file, the OS/kernel seems to truncate the file to the desired size - and rclone trace this information. Could'nt you keep this information for the upload (and detect that here my 28MB file is far from the 5G limit !) ?\r\n\r\n\r\n2018/11/26 22:28:53 DEBUG : test/SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip: >Open: fd=test/SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip (w), err=<nil>\r\n2018/11/26 22:28:53 DEBUG : /test/SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip: Truncate: size=28808600, fh=0x0\r\n2018/11/26 22:28:53 ERROR : test/SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip: WriteFileHandle: Truncate: Can't change size without --vfs-cache-mode >= writes\r\n...\r\n2018/11/26 22:28:54 DEBUG : test/SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip: Uploading segment file \"test/SQLiteStudio-3.2.1.zip/1543267734.0999914/-1/00000000\" into \"repository_files_segments\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
