the old error definitely disappeared, thank you! I am still fiddling around with the \"Too many requests\" problem. Hetzer (=target) responded they would not limit the storage on the writing end. And, of course, MS does not respond at all whether they limit the OneDrive on the reading end. \n\nWhat's surprising is that all bwlimits, tpslimits, transfers and checkers seem to have very little effect (if not none at all) on the stability of the transfer. Is there a way to dig a little deeper into what party (server, source or target) is causing the error? Also, I searched through your older posts regarding OneDrive and its throttling. Most people complain about how many seconds the sleep should be. I encounter sleep times of ~30 min and more and I observe how they come down over the course of a day of copy operation. But honestly, the majority of time the process appear to be in sleep and I wonder if it has to be that way?\n\nHere's my most recent:\n```\n2025/06/26 11:15:06 DEBUG : Too many requests.
