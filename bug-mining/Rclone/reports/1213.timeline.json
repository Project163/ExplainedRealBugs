just ran into this issue after trying PROPFIND with 1.65. \r\nTechnically, this is a follow-up on the `serve webdav` issues. #7444 and #7448. Some other items might also be related.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in the last comment [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7444#issuecomment-1828943189), that the message is `Request header field depth is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.`\r\nThis effectively prevents listing just the requested folder. The PROPFIND request works but it does not receive the Depth parameter, which is sent through the header. This comment contains the links to the WebDAV headers and the line that needs to be modified.\r\n\r\nAdditionally ,as @ncw mentioned [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7444#issuecomment-1838426670), this should be done in the webdav server, not the global one.\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nIssuing a PROPFIND request fails if it contains a `depth:1` header.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n1.65\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nWin 11, 64-bit\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
