What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nBasic gocritic linting via golangci-lint was enabled in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/8009.\r\n\r\nThis continues on that PR with additional features, primarily enabling custom linting rules with ruleguard via gocritic.\r\n\r\nIt then adds custom linting rules for log statements, with suggestions to use `fs.` instead of `log.`, which is required for `--use-json-log` to properly make log output in JSON format. This fixes https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6038.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- After ruleguard files are changed, lint cache will not be automatically invalidated. GitHub Actions cache must be manually deleted, unless waiting for the transition to a new year-week number because then it changes the cache key and therefore will the next lint will run without cache. Running locally, command `golangci-lint cache clean` can be used to test changes to ruleguard files.\r\n  > //Note that when used from golangci-lint (using the gocritic linter configured\r\n  > // with the ruleguard check), because rule files are not handled by\r\n  > // golangci-lint itself, changes will not invalidate the golangci-lint cache,\r\n  > // and you must manually clean to cache (golangci-lint cache clean) for them to\r\n  > // be considered, as explained here:\r\n  > // https://www.quasilyte.dev/blog/post/ruleguard/#using-from-the-golangci-lint\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Was the change
