This does work, but is rather clumsy compared to the drive trash listing. \r\n\r\nShowing the trash is likely to show duplicate directories also.\r\n\r\nDrive shows any trashed files directly in the trash which are in a a non-trashed directory.\r\n\r\nIdeas\r\n\r\n  * Can we do this with a query...
