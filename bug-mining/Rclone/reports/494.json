I suggest that if the user specifies any level of verbosity, rclone could output the latest publicly available stable version in that output as well.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'm not suggesting the output of `rclone version` or `rclone --version` change at all - I'm sure somebody's shell scripts somewhere depend on that. Instead, I'm suggesting that if the user passes one or more levels of verbosity, a simple HTTP GET could be performed with something like a 100ms timeout to rclone.org/versions/latest (or somewhere) that just returns a very simple string containing _only_ the version number, nothing else. If you get that response back in < 100ms, display appropriate output.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone version -v\r\nrclone v1.41\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.10.1\r\nLatest available via rclone.org: v1.4.9\r\nUpdate your package manager or visit rclone.org to upgrade to the latest stable release!\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I traveled to the future to get the above example, of course, after rclone v1.4.9 was released with this feature. 😃BTW they have hover cars in the future, true story!\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you're on the latest version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone version -v\r\nrclone v1.41\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.10.1\r\nLatest available via rclone.org: v1.4.1\r\nThanks for running the latest stable version of rclone!\r\n```\r\n\r\n> This sample from an alternate reality where Hover Boards DO work on water!\r\n\r\nAnd if rclone.org doesn't respond within < 100ms (or whatever's short and reasonable) for some reason? (User offline, internet exploded, clowns ate the server...), just ignore it and do what's already being done right now (omit last two lines).\r\n\r\nOptionally this could be put behind a `-vv` flag instead of just one level of verbosity, if that suits others better.\r\n\r\nBasically I think it would be nice to have a way to check what's _actually_ running - not what my package manager tells me, which may be wrong or lagging behind - against what's actually released. This could be a very handy feature for such a fast-moving and promising project!","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
