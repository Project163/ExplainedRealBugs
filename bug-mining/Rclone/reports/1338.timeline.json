The s3 clients want to access the files from that webdav server.\r\nSo I want to serve webdav backend with `serve s3` command. Allow multiple s3 clients to access webdav server via rclone's `serve s3` server.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\n1. add a WebDAV backend without `user` and `password` in rclone\r\n2. serve with `rclone serve s3 <remote> --proxy-mode`\r\n3. Multiple s3 clients send requests to acces the files that are stored in that webdav server\r\n\r\n![rclone_s3_proxy](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/assets/52366632/981b2007-25f5-4fc7-a802-509f75609f7e)\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nI tried to implement `--auth-proxy` but that works only with `user:pass`. Since the S3 client sends signed `Authorization` header, it is not possible to parse `user:pass` from the request by `serve s3`.\r\n\r\nSo, the one way is to work with oauth token. The s3 client uses oauth token as the accessKey (doesn't care about the secretKey).\r\n`serve s3` will then parses the oauth key from the request, creates new vfs and authorize that vfs with oauth token (Bearer token) per request.\r\n\r\nChanges required:\r\n1. method `setBearerToken` should be made public\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/8f0e9f9f6bd78f6ac7488ac48bbe7e9a9ba418ab/backend/webdav/webdav.go#L521\r\n2. `--proxy-mode` option for `serve s3` so that the default would be off.\r\n3. Parse oauth token from each s3 client request and create new vfs for the request context\r\n4. Requires gofakes3 Backend methods to receive request object:\r\n    ```go\r\n    ListBuckets(r *http.Request) ([]BucketInfo, error)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nPOC PRs in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7646, https://github.com/Mikubill/gofakes3/pull/3\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
