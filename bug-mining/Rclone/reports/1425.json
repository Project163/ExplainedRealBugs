Using version 1.69.3, this command takes just 2.8 s.  Using version 1.71.1, this command takes 17 m 2.1 s.  This command suffers from similar poor performance with other versions after 1.69.3.  Running the command using version 1.69.3 _without_ `--no-traverse` performs just as poorly as versions after 1.69.3 _with_ `--no-traverse`.\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\n1.71.1\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nFreeBSD 13.3-RELEASE-p4\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
