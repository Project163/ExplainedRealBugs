is a type of SFTP server that is termed a \"mailbox\" style, where you can only download/read each file one time. The current library doesn't work well with these servers as fstat/stat calls are made in the downloading code and that triggers the read and deletes the file before you can actually download it.\r\n\r\nA couple related issues in this project: #339  #206 \r\nHere's where Paramiko project (python ssh/sftp lib) dealt with it: https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/194\r\n\r\nThe main (only?) SFTP server that behaves like this is IBM Sterling B2B Integrator (SB2Bi). Here is their [troubleshooting page](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/troubleshooting-guide-why-does-sb2bi-sftp-server-adapter-reports-message-not-extractable-error-when-extractabilitycount1).\r\n\r\nThe symptom is generally getting a \"File does not exist\" error when downloading the file as the stat call is interpreted as a read and the file gets deleted before the actual download occurs.\r\n\r\nThe user (@newdayrising) from #339 dealt with this by writing a custom `WriteTo` method that takes the size of the file as an argument. This works as you are able to call `stat` on a file (on one of these servers) as many times as you like **before** you open the file for reading, but not after.\r\n\r\nWe should document this and possibly come up with a better way to deal with this situation as these servers seem to be fairly common.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkg/sftp/issues/345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkg/sftp/issues/345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4453924470,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0NTM5MjQ0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4453924470","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"45b2b05fa01c9d308937de4493f957fb5071a189","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/45b2b05fa01c9d308937de4493f957fb5071a189","created_at":"2021-03-13T15:10:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4453951251,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQ1Mzk1MTI1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4453951251","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"713f8f357dc5eb512f736ad97cb092dfbd1dbfe9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/713f8f357dc5eb512f736ad97cb092dfbd1dbfe9","created_at":"2021-03-13T15:38:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/798525986","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5077#issuecomment-798525986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5077","id":798525986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5ODUyNTk4Ng==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-13T15:39:10Z","updated_at":"2021-03-13T15:39:10Z","body":"The
