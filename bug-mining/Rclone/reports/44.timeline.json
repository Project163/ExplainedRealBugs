Programm is realy awesome! It works nice but i think i have found a small bug. I Upload my amazon folder with the /move command. this works sometimes greate but i think files bigger than ~15GB would not be deleted from harddisk after uploading. The File is still on ACD after upload! but it was not deleted from HDD. When the upload finish, he upload the File new again and again and again. The file from first upload in ACD is still OK/Hash OK!\n\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\n> newest from Homepage yesterday\n> \n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\n> Windows 10 64bit Enterprise bevore 2 days fresh installed and up to date\n> Windows 10 Premium 32bit same issue\n> \n> Which cloud storage system are you using?
