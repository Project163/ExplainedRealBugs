If I download something using nginx tough the rclone mount, I have a download speed of exactly 7,2 MB/s, but not more per connection. I know that my S3 storage can handle 10 Gbit/s+ at least, and other tools like s3browser under windows are working also fine. So my question is does rclone mount support multipart download, as to me, it really seems like it's not, not at all ;).\r\nThe funny fact is that, as already explained, this runs per connection. So I can open 30 connection each 7.2 MB/s but how to get higher throughput on a single download if --transfers flag is not supported by mount?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1120343203","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4760#issuecomment-1120343203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4760","id":1120343203,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5CxxSj","user":{"login":"seertenedos","id":401009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/401009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos","html_url":"https://github.com/seertenedos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seertenedos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-08T03:39:17Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T03:39:17Z","body":"one feature i would love to see is the ability for multi download of different parts of the file based on the requests coming into the VFS eg. if say a file is being read from in 2 different places the read-ahead would run for both locations in the file.

after seeing many forum posts on the forum, and this thread, I see you were interested in the use cases for this to be implemented.\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of testing and trying to compare some else mount

In my particular example, I am using Dropbox and connecting to my files through Europe. After asking Dropbox about where servers are located, they are primarily in the US, the article can be found [here](https://help.dropbox.com/security/physical-location-data-storage). \r\n\r\nI'm referring to this ticket [here](https://github.com/animosity22/homescripts/issues/98) where it shows more information about speeds. Thanks again animosity22 for the support!\r\n\r\nMulti-threading is a lot closer to utilising the speed of transfers, in my instance, this is a Gbit server and doesn't have I/O blockers. I've not had issues with Google (but they have a beefier backbone with more geo-located servers).\r\n\r\nI'd also seen a few remarks of bringing this back, and would be keen to know if this is the aim :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1263180204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MS-design-ui","id":49571600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTcxNjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49571600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui","html_url":"https://github.com/MS-design-ui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MS-design-ui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1273914536","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4760#issuecomment-1273914536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4760","id":1273914536,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5L7mSo","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-10T23:38:52Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T08:45:28Z","body":"I would also love to see this feature.
