its \"works\" but I can't complete my uploads, get errors like\n\n```\nReceived error: Post https://content-na.drive.amazonaws.com/cdproxy/nodes?suppress=deduplication: Post https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token: dial tcp: lookup api.amazon.com on 192.168.0.1:53: read udp 192.168.0.41:58874->192.168.0.1:53: i/o timeout - low level retry 4/10\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nReceived error: HTTP code 504: \"504 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT\", no response body - low level retry 1/10\n```\n\nthat seem to cause the uploade to restart\n\nthough in looking closer, I'm thinking that this might have been a network issue on my side.  the first error occured after the second error (the second error I listed is what reset the dowload) and I while the first error was happening, nothing was being uploaded, as if it couldn't connect.\n\nWith that said, my ssh connection to the host where this is running stayed alive, so a bit confused if it was actually networking issue on my side.  perhaps on amazon's side.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/221095792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sjpotter","id":1659735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter","html_url":"https://github.com/sjpotter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjpotter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/221097495","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/493#issuecomment-221097495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/493","id":221097495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTA5NzQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"schmorrison","id":17385251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mzg1MjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17385251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison","html_url":"https://github.com/schmorrison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schmorrison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-23T21:11:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-23T22:56:22Z","body":"EDIT:

the -30 beta and the issue is the same and appears to lock even faster than -28.  That could just be a coincidence however.\n\nThe only way I've gotten around restarting a transfer is to reauth via rclone config and then try again.\n\nI wonder if there could be a way to just submit a reauth on token failure?  Brute force but seems to work to get things going again at least for another 45 seconds or so.   Same thing though, if the sync dir list is short or null at the front, then the transfers at least commence for the first uploads.  But later on it's near impossible at this point to make and sync changes on large folder sets that have to be read first.\n\nI wonder if we can assign which endpoint we attach too like the fellow in the Amazon forumn.  Could be a cluster setting that has propagated but not to ALL yet perhaps.\n\nThanks for your amazing product though!  It's been the only solution for me to get backups of my nearly 6TB of data.

If I start at the top of my volumes that I've synced before and they range on the order of 600g to 1.4T then I get the weird s3 errors in that 15-25 minute range.  I wonder if it's just we have to also slow down the directory reads in general to some magic rate?  At this time if the directory is shallow then it gets right to copying new data just fine even across smaller files.  I'm rate limited to 5mb outbound if that matters too.  Great work!!!!!!  And thanks.  I'll grab you the detailed log this evening when I get home from work.

On one of the larger syncs, it still takes about 25 mins to get the remote list done part, and the it appears the local list finishes in another 10 mins or so.  BUT now it waits upwards of 20 more mins or longer don't know because I get the \"kill\" at the last line at 1 hour 5 seconds.. So I guess if no transfers are being setup before the one hour mark then the token expires silently and then done?  On smaller directory syncs this and the previous build seemed to work but have the same processing quirk it seems.
