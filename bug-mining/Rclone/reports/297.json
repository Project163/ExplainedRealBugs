Our documentation is at https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/performance#partial-response.\r\n\r\nThe Go API has `Fields()` calls which can be given a list of strings.  These need to be the strings as used in the JSON api as listed in the v2 docs.\r\n\r\nIt should be a straightforward exercise to add calls to `Fields()` in the drive API and run through the integration tests to make sure nothing is broken. \r\n\r\nThe most important place to add this is in the listing routine, and the reading metadata.\r\n\r\nI know that some of the other APIs (OneDrive springs to mind - there may be others) can also do this.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1346/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
