In [cmd/copy](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/cmd/copy/copy.go#L75), rclone runs a sync if src is a directory and runs a CopyFile operation if it is a single file. Your commands are doing this on directories so `--backup-dir` works. Also, if `rclone sync` is used instead of `rclone copy` or `rclone move`, sync is always used so `--backup-dir` works even for a single file.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/495065392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Cnly","id":3103188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly","html_url":"https://github.com/Cnly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/495170156","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3219#issuecomment-495170156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3219","id":495170156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NTE3MDE1Ng==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-23T10:53:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T10:53:55Z","body":"Gotcha

existence of --backup-dir in move & copy, however in sync there are a few sanity checks in newSyncCopyMove() that are not done here, for example not allowing the backup directory to be the same as the src or dst\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/4549305fec833bf50516d287002cdba6548695c9/fs/sync/sync.go#L134-L142\r\n\r\nso right now a command like:\r\n```\r\nrclone copy local/one.txt dest --backup-dir=local\r\n```\r\nwill overwrite the src or error.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless you want to duplicate the checks and all --backup-dir and --suffix code, it might better to make a separate function somewhere (in config?) that gets passed the src, dst, backupdir, and suffix, that returns the final backup directory and suffix or an error.\r\nthis can then be called by any of the primitives if either backupdir or suffix flags are used.\r\n\r\nthis will also make implementing #2801 simpler.\r\n\r\nif you think that is a good idea i and can point me where to put it i will start on it.\r\nthanks","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/502550695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yparitcher","id":38916402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTE2NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38916402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher","html_url":"https://github.com/yparitcher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"yparitcher","id":38916402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTE2NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38916402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher","html_url":"https://github.com/yparitcher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yparitcher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-17T06:26:23Z","updated_at":"2019-06-17T06:26:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3266","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3266/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3266/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3266/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/3266","id":456706815,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg4NjY5MTcx","number":3266,"title":"[WIP]
