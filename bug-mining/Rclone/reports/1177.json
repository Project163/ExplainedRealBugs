We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nrclone v1.62.2\r\n- os/version: arch \"rolling\" (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.3.2 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.20.4\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nThere are currently a lot of open issues for rclone due to the use of a native ssh client in rclone that does not support many features that common SSH implementations like OpenSSH support. Examples are:  https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2843 https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6987 https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7011 \r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nAll of these issues could easily be solved by providing an option to use an external ssh command instead, e.g. using the OpenSSH client on Unix hosts. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
