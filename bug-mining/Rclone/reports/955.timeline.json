relatively common to compress plaintext data before encrypting it.\r\n\r\nThis is because you can't really compress it after encrypting it because good compression randomizes the data from the point of view of the compression algorithm and makes it compress very poorly.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, since the data is randomized by compression, it can't be de-duplicated by the server, so even if the storage remote backing the crypt remote supports de-duplication, you still end up paying to store every encrypted byte.\r\n\r\nIt therefore might be useful if the crypt remote type supported (optional) compression which could potentially provide savings in terms of storage cost, upload and download bandwidth, and upload and download time.\r\n\r\nIf anybody ever ends up acting on this feature request, two additional things t consider:\r\n\r\n1) Make sure a mix of compressed and uncompressed encrypted files is supported -- i.e., indicate in the header of the uploaded file whether it is compressed or uncompressed and react appropriately when downloading -- so that there is a backward-compatible path to enabling compression without having to re-upload all the files in the remote;\r\n\r\n2) Dynamically determine while uploading whether individual files should be compressed or whether they're already compressed so additional compression won't help. For example, I played around with this a bit and found that a good algorithm is something like this:\r\n\r\n* Read and compress the first 10MB of the file (big enough chunk to get a good idea whether compression will be useful on the entire file).\r\n* If the file size is less than 10MB, then:\r\n  * If the compressed blob is smaller than the uncompressed data, then upload the file compressed.\r\n  * Else upload the file uncompressed.\r\n* Else if the compressed 10MB blob is 25% or more smaller than the uncompressed blob, then upload the file compressed.\r\n* Else upload the file uncompressed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2098/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2098/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/371619822","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1627#issuecomment-371619822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1627","id":371619822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MTYxOTgyMg==","user":{"login":"cowwoc","id":633348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzM0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc","html_url":"https://github.com/cowwoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowwoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-08T20:50:12Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T20:50:12Z","body":"This feature, or lack thereof, is a very very big deal to me (the practical implication is data loss in case I want to recover an older version of my data).\r\n\r\nCan we expect a fix in the short-term?

on identifying the version string that backend/b2 adds to the\r\nfilename. There are pathological cases where an obfuscated filename\r\ncould end in what looks like a version string purely by chance. In such\r\na case, this code will incorrectly leave that portion of the filename\r\nobfuscated. There's not really a clean fix for that, other than keeping\r\ntrack of versions out-of-band instead of in the filename string.\r\n\r\nFixes #1627\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nBackground: Backblaze B2 supports multiple versions of a given filename. rclone supports this behind `--b2-versions` for read-only access, by appending a timestamp suffix to all but the most recent version of a file. The crypt backend supports encrypted or obfuscated filenames, but fails to decrypt them when a timestamp suffix has been added.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the crypt backend to identify when a file has a version string added to it. If it does, the version string will be stripped off before decrypting the filename, and added back to the decrypted name. This allows `--b2-versions` to be used with crypt remotes backed by B2.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nThis issue was discussed in #1627, where a fix broadly similar to this was suggested.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- *Note:* I have added unit tests, but I'm not sure what the best way is to add integration tests for a crypt remote backed by b2. I imagine we want to add some that cover this use case.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
