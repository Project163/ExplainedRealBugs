Do the initial clone\n         b. Avoid the files already RCLONE had problems with in the subsequent scheduled RCLONE runs, because if the first clone failed to copy a few files, the chances are they would fail again and it's better to ignore them during the second run.\n\n2.What's your take on one of the below solutions by _ameir in #180_\n\n> I have tried the following projects, and one thing it does that I think is clever is maintain a local cache of remote file metadata in sqlite\n> https://github.com/alex-phillips/clouddrive-node\n> https://github.com/alex-phillips/clouddrive-php\n\n**More Suggestions :)**\n1. Add `rclone -h` command's output to the `man rclone` command's output because it took a while for me to figure out how to use the _retries flag_. Since I didn't find the retries switch usage in man, I was trying different things expecting it to stop the retrying and when it never did, I always though it was my usage which had the problem until I got the exact syntax with _rclone -h_. Finally, after I was certain that I was using the command properly, I asked this question here.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/167862944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kpabba","id":16469875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDY5ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16469875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba","html_url":"https://github.com/kpabba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/169177963","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/266#issuecomment-169177963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/266","id":169177963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTE3Nzk2Mw==","user":{"login":"kpabba","id":16469875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDY5ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16469875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba","html_url":"https://github.com/kpabba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpabba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-06T00:29:50Z","updated_at":"2016-01-06T00:29:50Z","body":"Hi nwc,\n\nJust wanted to post a quick update.
