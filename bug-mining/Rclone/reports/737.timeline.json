--order-by string ###\r\n\r\nThe `--order-by` flag controls the order in which files in the backlog\r\nare processed in `rclone sync`, `rclone copy` and `rclone move`.\r\n\r\nThe order by string is constructed like this.  The first part\r\ndescribes what aspect is being measured:\r\n\r\n- `size` - order by the size of the files\r\n- `name` - order by the full path of the files\r\n- `modtime` - order by the modification date of the files\r\n\r\nThis can have a modifier appended with a comma:\r\n\r\n- `ascending` or `asc` - order so that the smallest (or oldest) is processed first\r\n- `descending` or `desc` - order so that the largest (or newest) is processed first\r\n\r\nIf no modifier is supplied then the order is `ascending`.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n- `--order-by size,desc` - send the largest files first\r\n- `--order-by modtime,ascending` - send the oldest files first\r\n- `--order-by name` - send the files with alphabetically by path first\r\n\r\nIf the `--order-by` flag is not supplied or it is supplied with an\r\nempty string then the default ordering will be used which is as\r\nscanned.  With `--checkers 1` this is mostly alphabetical, however\r\nwith the default `--checkers 8` it is somewhat random.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/562555316/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/569506660","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1205#issuecomment-569506660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1205","id":569506660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTUwNjY2MA==","user":{"login":"dom-de-v","id":11558764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTU4NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11558764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v","html_url":"https://github.com/dom-de-v","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dom-de-v/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-29T13:40:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T13:40:36Z","body":"Hi Nick,\r\nNot seeing this branch function correctly (on a big sync or copy), specifically with:\r\n\r\nrclone-v1.50.2-084-g7d79ab7b-fix-1205-order-by-beta-osx-amd64/rclone copy /path/wherever gdrive:wherever --fast-list --transfers=22 --checkers=44 --tpslimit=90 --drive-chunk-size=1M --verbose --verbose --order-by size,ascending\r\n\r\nIs sending many larger files before smaller files -

Or does that need more explanation?\r\n\r\n#### Limitations\r\n\r\nThe `--order-by` flag does not do a separate pass over the data.  This\r\nmeans that is may transfer some files out of the order specified if\r\n\r\n- there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully scanned yet\r\n- there are more than [--max-backlog](#max-backlog-n) files in the backlog\r\n\r\nRclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in\r\npractice this should not cause a problem.
