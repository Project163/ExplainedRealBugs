Currently rclone is using `\"_config\":{\"Headers\": [{\"Key\": \"as-user\",\"Value\": \"XXXXXXXXXXX\"}]} ` to pass the user id and cache it. It creates issues when working with multiple copy and other operations. \r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nrclone should add an _as-user_ or any appropriate named key in Box type config section to store the user as it is using _impersonate_ for the google drive type config to store email. So it can be passed to headers from config section.  \r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
