This seems unexpected from the docs description of retries:\r\n```\r\n--retries int\r\nRetry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).\r\n```\r\nas I would not consider hitting the specified `max-duration` a failure. The docs for `max-duration` also don't indicate this:\r\n```\r\n--max-duration=TIME\r\nRclone will stop scheduling new transfers when it has run for the duration specified.\r\nDefaults to off.\r\nWhen the limit is reached any existing transfers will complete.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems related to the forum post above (not posted by me), and to these previously filed issues:  https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4504 and https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4002. However the forum post indicates it should be fixed with the latest 1.58.0 beta, and even with that I still see the issue.\r\n\r\nI've included a debug log demonstrating this, but to summarize what I think are the relevant parts: a copy job to an encrypted Backblaze B2 remote with `\"--max-duration=5m\"` and `\"--retries\" \"3\"`.  The job begins by setting a deadline 5 minutes out:\r\n```\r\n2022/02/19 11:01:17 INFO  : Encrypted drive 'b2cryptsse:max_duration_test/Photos/archives': Transfer session deadline: 2022/02/19 11:06:17\r\n```\r\nAt the 5-minute mark, the logs indicate it has hit the deadline but then begins a repeat of the same job with a new deadline another 5 minutes later, also doing file comparisons of the files that had already been uploaded:\r\n```\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:17 ERROR : photos_2021.zip.004: Failed to copy: Post \"https://pod-040-2006-14.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402006_t0014\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:17 ERROR : photos_2021.zip.002: Failed to copy: Post \"https://pod-040-2005-03.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402005_t0004\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:17 ERROR : photos_2021.zip.001: Failed to copy: Post \"https://pod-040-2002-15.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402002_t0057\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:17 ERROR : photos_2021.zip.003: Failed to copy: Post \"https://pod-040-2001-07.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402001_t0015\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:17 ERROR : photos_2021.vol063+64.par2: Failed to copy: Post \"https://pod-040-2000-16.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402000_t0011\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:17 ERROR : Attempt 1/3 failed with 5 errors and: Post \"https://pod-040-2002-15.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402002_t0057\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:17 INFO  : Encrypted drive 'b2cryptsse:max_duration_test/Photos/archives': Transfer session deadline: 2022/02/19 11:11:17\r\n2022/02/19 11:06:18 DEBUG : photos_2021.par2: Size and modification time the same (differ by -66.5µs, within tolerance 1ms)\r\n```\r\nThe same thing 5 minutes later:\r\n```\r\n2022/02/19 11:11:17 ERROR : Attempt 2/3 failed with 5 errors and: Post \"https://pod-040-2006-14.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402006_t0014\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:11:17 INFO  : Encrypted drive 'b2cryptsse:max_duration_test/Photos/archives': Transfer session deadline: 2022/02/19 11:16:17\r\n```\r\nAnd then having hit 3 retries, it finally fails 5 minutes after that\r\n```\r\n2022/02/19 11:16:17 ERROR : Attempt 3/3 failed with 5 errors and: Post \"https://pod-040-2005-03.backblaze.com/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/f433ac23c06708ee77f1021b/c004_v0402005_t0004\": context deadline exceeded\r\n2022/02/19 11:16:17 NOTICE: \r\nTransferred:   \t    3.842 GiB / 12.761 GiB, 30%, 4.386 MiB/s, ETA 34m42s\r\nErrors:                 5 (retrying may help)\r\nChecks:                16 / 16, 100%\r\nTransferred:            8 / 18, 44%\r\nElapsed time:      15m0.4s\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like I could avoid this by setting `retries=1` but I'd like to be able to specify retries in the case of something like network disruption, but also set a max duration if I want the job to run a set amount of time.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.58.0-beta.6000.dc7e3ea1e\r\n- os/version: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 6.1.7601.24544 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: windows\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.17.6\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: cmount\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nWindows 7 x64 SP1\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
