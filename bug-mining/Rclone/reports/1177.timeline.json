had a go at this. It was harder than I thought it was going to be!\r\n\r\nPlease give it a test\r\n\r\n[v1.63.0-beta.7056.02069f065.fix-7012-sftp-external-ssh](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-7012-sftp-external-ssh/v1.63.0-beta.7056.02069f065.fix-7012-sftp-external-ssh/) on branch [fix-7012-sftp-external-ssh](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/tree/fix-7012-sftp-external-ssh) (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nHere is the help for the new parameter `ssh` or `--sftp-ssh`\r\n\r\n#### --sftp-ssh\r\n\r\nPath and arguments to external ssh binary.\r\n\r\nNormally rclone will use its internal ssh library to connect to the\r\nSFTP server. However it does not implement all possible ssh options so\r\nit may be desirable to use an external ssh binary.\r\n\r\nRclone ignores all the internal config if you use this option and\r\nexpects you to configure the ssh binary with the host/port and any\r\nother options you need.\r\n\r\n**Important** The ssh command must log in without asking for a\r\npassword so needs to be configured with keys or certificates.\r\n\r\nRclone will run the command supplied either with \"-s sftp\" to access\r\nthe SFTP subsystem or with commands such as \"md5sum /path/to/file\"\r\nappended.\r\n\r\nAny arguments with spaces in should be surrounded by \"double quotes\".\r\n\r\nAn example setting might be:\r\n\r\n    ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=20 user@example.com\r\n\r\nNote that when using an external ssh binary rclone makes a new ssh\r\nconnection for every hash it calculates.\r\n\r\n\r\nProperties:\r\n\r\n- Config:      ssh\r\n- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SSH\r\n- Type:        SpaceSepList\r\n- Default:

trying to use rclone v1.66.0 to copy between two remote sftp servers. The target server I can setup with the usual sftp config, however the source server I need to use `--sftp-ssh` as I need to use `ProxyJump` defined in my ssh config. Independently, I can use rclone to ls on either server. However when trying to do rclone copy from source to target, `--sftp-ssh` for the source seems to be overriding the config for the target sftp server. The log pretty much says as much and I also end up with the target path on the source server.
