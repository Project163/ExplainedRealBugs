set using the\nfollowing flags which are specific to the FTP backend:\n\n```\n--ftp-no-check-certificate     Do not verify the TLS certificate of the server\n--ftp-disable-tls13            Disable TLS 1.3 (workaround for FTP servers with buggy TLS)\n--ftp-tls-cache-size int       Size of TLS session cache for all control and data connections (default 32)\n```\n\nHowever any of the global TLS flags can also be used such as:\n\n```\n--ca-cert stringArray          CA certificate used to verify servers\n--client-cert string           Client SSL certificate (PEM) for mutual TLS auth\n--client-key string            Client SSL private key (PEM) for mutual TLS auth\n--no-check-certificate         Do not verify the server SSL certificate (insecure)\n```\n\nIf these need to be put in the config file so they apply to just the\nFTP backend then use the `override` syntax, eg\n\n```\noverride.ca_cert = XXX\noverride.client_cert = XXX\noverride.client_key = XXX\n```\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3201489312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19266143487,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M5aw1nNzwAAAAR8WgT_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19266143487","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e1db68b6bb81946df6b2ca12e4417deedc7adbdb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/e1db68b6bb81946df6b2ca12e4417deedc7adbdb","created_at":"2025-08-21T13:08:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19285533009,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M5aw1nNzwAAAAR9geFR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19285533009","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e7a2b322ecc3356da3f82bc8e665765f373b7d28","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/e7a2b322ecc3356da3f82bc8e665765f373b7d28","created_at":"2025-08-22T11:22:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19286016142,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M5aw1nNzwAAAAR9iUCO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/19286016142","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e7a2b322ecc3356da3f82bc8e665765f373b7d28","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PHATWalrus/rclone/commit
