After digging a few hours I noticed that compared to other S3 services (here with MinIO), rclone returns the value inside `<Key>` (= filenames) as a **URL-encoded** string, while no `<EncodingType>` node in the response indicates this content type is in use.\r\n\r\nWhile it's a bit unclear in the specs, in that case the client should expect a proper UTF-8 string and so it leads to issues when it reuses and re-URL-encode it before sending a `HeadObject` request for example, because it returns a 404.\r\n\r\n[The doc says](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax) _Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the [object keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html) in the response. Responses are encoded only in UTF-8._ so unless you pass the `content-encoding=url` parameter in the query, returned filenames should not be encoded that way.\r\n\r\nExpected: `<Key>Æther Realm/[2011] Odin Will Provide/cover.jpg</Key>`\r\nActual: `<Key>%C3%86ther+Realm/%5B2011%5D+Odin+Will+Provide/cover.jpg</Key>`\r\n\r\nI've tried with two different rclone backends: WebDAV and the local filesystem. The result is the same.\r\n\r\nThe test has been performed with Azuracast, which uses the [official `aws-sdk-php` library](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php) for the heavy lifting. We can then assume this is _not_ because of an invalid custom adapter.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7836/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7836/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
