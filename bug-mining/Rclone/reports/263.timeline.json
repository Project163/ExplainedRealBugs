Out of about ~3500 files, 90 of them says that they are \"corrupted on transfer: MD5 hash differ\". These are mostly .mp4 files, but there are also a handful of JPEG files.\r\n\r\nI then tried to manually download a few of the corrupted files one at a time (as shown in the form above) and I kept getting the same error.  I checked the using the web interface and there is no duplicate of the file. \r\n\r\nI then downloaded the file using the web interface and manually run md5sum on it and got: cd6c3d2dc4e91101b5000357dfd96e73\r\nI then also tried using [https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive] to download the entire 'Google Photos' folder and was able to do so. The md5sum of the downloaded file (via gdrive) is also the same as the version downloaded via web interface.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to help troubleshoot this issue? It is also curious that from multiple attempts rclone always end up with the same corrupted MD5 hash. \r\n\r\nThe files in my Google Photos are mostly from automatic upload from an Android phone and I wanted to use rclone as an automated way to also keep a backup of those on my local machine.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/981/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/270709860","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/793#issuecomment-270709860","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/793","id":270709860,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDcwOTg2MA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-05T17:52:33Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T17:52:33Z","body":"Can
