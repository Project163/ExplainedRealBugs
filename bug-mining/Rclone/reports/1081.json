You can run the \"job/stop\" command can stop a specific job but RClone is lacking similar functionality to stop a group. By \"group\", I am referring to https://rclone.org/rc/#assigning-operations-to-groups-with-group-value. This could be useful for long running operations that need to be halted and returned to at a later point. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAdd functionality to stop a group. The method would look something like \"core/stop\" and accept a parameter for the \"_group\" identifier. It might look similar to https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/fs/rc/jobs/job.go#L393-L408.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
