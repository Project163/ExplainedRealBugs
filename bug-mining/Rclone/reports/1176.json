While Orgzly, a native Android app, is great, I believe that PWAs offer better opportunities, both to the developers and to the users. Therefore, I would like to use a PWA (https://organice.200ok.ch/) for the purpose of working with .org files.\r\nThis app supports working over WebDAV (since local file access in PWAs is still clunky). Unfortunately, my storage provider, while supporting WebDAV access, does not support CORS. Therefore, it is impossible to access the storage via WebDAV in any JavaScript-based browser application.\r\nI was hoping rclone would come to the rescue with it's `rclone serve webdav` but unfortunately that provides exactly the same result - it doesn't support CORS. Or at least I can't find one in the docs and help texts.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nInclude CORS header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` when serving files over WebDAV (and potentially other protocols).\r\n\r\nSimilar to #2575, I would really appreciate if CORS headers were supported (through an option parameter) when serving files, either via HTTP or WebDAV (`rclone server webdav`).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
