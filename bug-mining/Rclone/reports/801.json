I use it regularly and didn't have this issue in the past but I did not change anything knowingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nI tried several, including the latest beta:\r\n```\r\n./rclone version\r\nrclone v1.50.2-146-g3a1b41ac-beta\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nLinux, 64 bit\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n```\r\nrclone mount\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nI mounted with `--log-level DEBUG --dir-cache-time 60m` and then run `find gdrivefs/ -maxdepth 1` twice. Both find commands end with `find: ‘gdrivefs/’: Input/output error`.\r\n\r\nThe rclone command produces a ton of output but nothing looking suspicious. On the second run with everything cached it only procudes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020/01/16 19:49:30 DEBUG : /: ReadDirAll: \r\n2020/01/16 19:49:30 DEBUG : /: >ReadDirAll: item=1556, err=<nil>\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3884/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
