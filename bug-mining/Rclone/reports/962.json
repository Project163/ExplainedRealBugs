This causes bash to not show anything i type until i hit enter, requiring a restart or a new session. Testing with zsh also crashes, but i am able to continue typing and see it on the terminal. \r\n\r\nUsing ncdu locally (pkg install ncdu) i can scroll and use arrow keys perfectly fine\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n> rclone v1.55.0-DEV\r\n> - os/type: android\r\n> - os/arch: arm64\r\n> - go/version: go1.16\r\n> - go/linking: dynamic\r\n> - go/tags: none\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nAndroid 10\r\nArm64\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
