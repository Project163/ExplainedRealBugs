Preamble\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n- adds the [Docker Volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/)  [**API**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/) support to rclone in the form of `rclone serve docker` command\r\n- slightly refactors `cmd/mountlib` as the implementation heavily uses VFS/mount\r\n- improves Makefile and the CI/CD to build the rclone docker plugin container\r\n\r\nInspired by [sapk/docker-volume-rclone](https://github.com/sapk/docker-volume-rclone) and based on the prior work by @sapk in [sapk-fork/serve-docker](https://github.com/sapk-fork/rclone/tree/serve-docker)\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4750\r\n- https://github.com/sapk/docker-volume-rclone/issues/6\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added

Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n\r\n### MountLib\r\n\r\nI continued the refactoring started by @sapk on the [sapk-fork/serve-docker](https://github.com/sapk-fork/rclone/commits/serve-docker/cmd/serve/docker) branch. Not only do I factor `RunMount` from `cmd/mountlib/Mount` but also introduce the `MountPoint` structure with dedicated methods and separate `MountInfo` structure for marshalling mount state by the rclone `rcd` API. All refactoring commits as well as original commits from @sapk are **separate** for easier review.\r\n\r\n### Docker Plugin SDK\r\n\r\nI tried to continue using the [docker/go-plugins-helpers](https://github.com/docker/go-plugins-helpers) SDK but encountered a number of problems:\r\n- We actually use only the Volume API which is less than 20% of SDK\r\n- SDK spams system logs with trace messages and gives no way to disable it\r\n- Systemd socket activation is declared but does not actually work\r\n- SDK unconditionally tries to modify root-only files in `/run/docker/plugins` and `/etc/docker/plugins` and provides *no way* to change this behavior so testing API by non-root was impossible\r\n- SDK depends on external package [docker/go-connections](https://github.com/docker/go-connections/sockets) which attempts to `chown` files adding another root-only dependency\r\n- SDK adds more external dependencies in particular on Azure packages, this growing rclone executable too much\r\n\r\nI created the [SDK fork](https://github.com/ivandeex/go-plugins-helpers), developed [a number of patches](https://github.com/ivandeex/go-plugins-helpers/commits/devel) and started submitting pull requests, in particular https://github.com/docker/go-plugins-helpers/pull/130. However, the SDK repository looks *a little bit abandoned*, still has its CI/CD based on the obsolete travis.org so even my first patch got stuck like [a number of other PRs](https://github.com/docker/go-plugins-helpers/pulls). Some other patches depend on unreleased features in [external docker packages](https://github.com/docker/go-connections) so I can't predict whether they can get through in reasonable time.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I decided to drop dependency on [docker/go-plugins-helpers](https://github.com/docker/go-plugins-helpers) altogether. The use of *go-chi http router* let the resulting code be very small (take a look at [api.go](https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/blob/ci-docker/cmd/serve/docker/api.go) and [serve.go](https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/blob/ci-docker/cmd/serve/docker/serve.go)) and get rid of all above problems. Now we can have a complete unit test for the new command.\r\n\r\n### httplib and go-chi\r\n\r\nI also tried to use the brand new [rclone/lib/http](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/tree/e489a101f631db31ec7c6d97ca4d8034c573031a/lib/http) but found it problematic. I love that it introduces *go-chi*, but it does that in a strange way. I needed to create a server listening on provided socket but the structure returned by [NewServer](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/e489a101f631db31ec7c6d97ca4d8034c573031a/lib/http/http.go#L120) does not have a *Serve method*, at all. I tried to understand how the new `cmd server http` [uses the new library](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/e489a101f631db31ec7c6d97ca4d8034c573031a/cmd/serve/http/http.go#L66) but I failed to wrap my head around who serves what. I guess that the real listening server is hidden as a singleton inside the library, internally attached to the `httplib.Router` and can be configured only via command line. :cry: Maybe I miss something... By the way, what was the reasoning behind renaming `httplib` to `http` and then adding ugly import aliases in a dozen places inside rclone to decipher it from `net/http`? We could just have `rclone/lib/httplib` and simply use it directly. I abandoned further attempts to use this strange code and stick with good old `net/http`  dressed by the seasoned `go-chi`.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\nEvery mount needs three groups of options: Backend, VFS and Mount options. The base fork has left this problem [for future](https://github.com/sapk-fork/rclone/blob/serve-docker/cmd/serve/docker/driver.go#L41). The generic Volume API will pass options as a `[string]string` map when the volume is created (following mount requests have no way to customize it, so I attach options to the volume not to its mounts). The docker command line provides for `docker volume create ... -o option1=value1 -o ...`, i.e. all options have a *flat scheme* with string names and values. Docker Swarm has a YAML format where options are represented by a yaml map (note that YAML accepts dashes in key names only if the key is quoted, but underscores can be used as is). The least common divisor is the flag string-to-string dictionary.\r\n\r\nRclone provides a number of ways to pass options:\r\n1. as command-line flags with lower-case dash-separated option names with backend name as a prefix,\r\n2. as environment variables with upper-case underscore-separated names,\r\n3. as `name = value` tokens in `rclone.conf` with lower-case underscore-separated names without backend prefix,\r\n4. as connection string tokens similar to item 3 above (no backend prefix here, so only the immediate backend can be configured this way, not the underlying backend in case of alias or crypt),\r\n5. as json dictionaries in the rclone daemon API, with nested dictionaries for mount and VFS options.\r\n\r\nThe flat option scheme used by the docker plugin mimics the first case above. Every volume option looks like a twin command line flag with obvious exception of the `--` CLI flag prefix. Underscores can be used instead of dashes in option names for cleaner use with YAML. Additionally there are 5 special options:\r\n- `remote` (aliased as `fs`) determines existing remote from config file with a path or on-the-fly remote using the `-o remote=remote_name[,connect_string]:path/subdir` syntax.\r\n- using `-o type=backend` is equivalent to the `:backend:` syntax\r\n- `path` provides explicit on-remote path for *type*, for example `-o type=storj -o path=dir/subdir` is equivalent to `-o remote=:storj:dir/subdir`\r\n- `mount-type` can be \"mount\", \"cmount\" or \"mount2\", and defaults to the first found mount method.\r\n- `persist` is reserved for future to create remotes persisted in rclone.conf similar to rcd, for example `-o mount-type=mount2`\r\n\r\n@ncw @sapk I would like to hear from you. Are the `fs type path` options excessive or we can keep them?\r\n\r\nAlso you can pass a complete `rclone.conf` to the plugin if you put it at `/var/lib/docker/plugins/rclone/config/rclone.conf`. This should allow user to pass storage provider tokens obtained externally similar to headless rclone setup.\r\n\r\n### Mount Registry\r\n\r\nThe next design decision was how to maintain a volume/mount lifecycle. The plugin can run **(a)** in a special `runc` container beside normal docker containers (so called managed mode) or **(b)** as a process independent from docker daemon (under systemd or just invoked from command line). When it runs separately, it can be restarted independently from docker.\r\n\r\nThe plugin serves mounts to recipients via the **kernel FUSE module** and serves API on a Unix domain or TCP socket. Docker daemon can request volume create or removal requests to the plugin as well as volume mount/unmount requests. Docker passes mounts created by the plugin (on the host or in its container) to docker managed containers via bind mounting mechanism. Every volume can be mounted by several containers independently.\r\n\r\nContainers can be killed or crash otherwise, docker daemon can be restarted on crash otherwise, the host can be rebooted, volumes can fail to created due to network problems. Docker swarm can activate a volume on multiple swarm nodes. What should give if the plugin got restarted after crash or reboot? Will docker re-send volume creation requests? Mount requests? How will docker daemon know what requests to resend? It will take care of most situations, e.g. it will restart the plugin and restart (I mean not just *start* but *stop-kill-restart*) the containers. If a container crashed, docker will restart it and pass *new* mount request to plugin with new *mounter ID*. Looks clean, almost... Unfortunately guys from Docker, Inc. who designed the API, have forgotten about the HEALTHCHECK protocol message so their implementation is not 100% clean.\r\n\r\nWhat should the volume plugin do when it's started after crash or host reboot? The correct behavior is to recreate all volumes that existed before the crash. The same does not hold for volume mounts - the restarted plugin cannot restore mounts due to broken connection with storage providers. If a docker container will try to access a zombie mount, the process in it will get `Transport point not connected` from the kernel and that's correct. So I looked into existing volume plugin implementations and found that the prominent ones ([sshfs](https://github.com/vieux/docker-volume-sshfs/blob/v1.4/main.go#L50), [local-persist](https://github.com/MatchbookLab/local-persist/blob/master/driver.go#L231) [netshare](https://github.com/ContainX/docker-volume-netshare/blob/v0.36/netshare/netshare.go#L287), etc) do use a kind of volume registry persisted locally. Moreover, I encountered the ticket [moby#35120](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35120) where @cpuguy83 (a docker mainter) says in clear English:\r\n\r\n> Yes, this is a flaw in the v1 plugin design itself which propagates itself through to the volume plugin API.\r\n> Again, willing to take a patch to alleviate some of this (and we must understand the trade-offs), but do not generally want to modify the existing volume plugin API itself except for major issues as we are working on bringing CSI on and making modifications to the current API is risky. [...]\r\n> However the plugin should still essentially **treat the caller as an idiot and keep track of it's on it's own** regardless of what capabilities the caller has.\r\n\r\nNote that he mentions the industry standard [CSI API](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md), which is currently used by such container orchestrators as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/) or [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/plugins/csi#csi-plugins) and is [going to be](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/39624) implemented by Docker Swarm in a [future release](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/41982). I am going to submit `rclone serve csi` when I have resources for it. Hopefully its design is cleaner and CSI plugins can trust their plugin host a little more.\r\n\r\nSo... now we have the registry persisted in `docker-plugin.state` under rclone cache directory and unit tests for it. In case something gets stuck upon startup, we have the `--forget-state` flag that can be passed to the command and a way to pass it to managed plugin. The base fork [sapk-fork/server-docker](https://github.com/sapk-fork/rclone/tree/serve-docker) proposed [preserving the whole rclone.conf section](https://github.com/sapk-fork/rclone/blob/serve-docker/cmd/serve/docker/driver.go#L62) but I see problems with this approach, in particular how to pass dynamic provider tokens in and out of the managed plugin container. I think that state file is a better solution, waiting for your comments. Some drivers have the ability to [restore state from docker daemon](https://github.com/MatchbookLab/local-persist/blob/master/driver.go#L190) in addition to state file, but I think we a good enough for now and this can be left for future PRs.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nI decided to split the short (put aside the VFS/mount options) command help from the long docker plugin documentation. Please take a look at [command help](https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/blob/ci-docker/docs/content/commands/rclone_serve_docker.md#rclone-serve-docker) and [docker.md](https://github.com/ivandeex/rclone/blob/ci-docker/docs/content/docker.md#docker-volume-plugin). Please take a look and verify against [my plugin build](https://hub.docker.com/r/ivandeex/docker-volume-rclone/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated), which can be installed using `docker plugin install ivandeex/docker-volume-rclone`. I am using it on a test rig for a month now.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\n@ncw @sapk\r\nLooking forward to your reviews :pray:
