current Homebrew formula for `rclone` builds a version of the binary that doesn't support mounting, even when `macfuse` is installed independently (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4775). I've created a Homebrew cask that downloads and installs a fully featured version of `rclone` from the project's GitHub releases page (and includes the `macfuse` cask as a dependency). I'm making an issue here so other Homebrew users who want to have a scriptable, fully-featured rclone install can know about it.\r\n\r\nThe cask is here: https://github.com/brettferdosi/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Casks/rclone-cask.rb - feel free to use it directly (though no guarantees about timely updates) or copy it into your own tap.
