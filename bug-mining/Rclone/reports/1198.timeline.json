Version: documentation published at https://rclone.org/s3/ at time of issue submission.\r\n> \r\n> This isn't an issue with the executable, but rather the documentation. The documentation goes on, at extreme length, to list all the regions for the different providers.\r\n\r\nIt does, yes!\r\n\r\n> This is actively harmful to the people maintaining the documentation, and those of us trying to use it.\r\n\r\nNote that those docs are auto generated, so don't edit them directly.\r\n\r\n> Examples include:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Users either picked the region(s) when creating their bucket, or will need to be told which region(s) they can use by whichever entity is providing access.\r\n> 2. Providing an exhaustive list of regions is impractical, maintenance heavy, and will list regions or providers that no longer exist.\r\n> 3. Third, and worst, it bloats the S3 page (https://rclone.org/s3), so much that it makes it very difficult to actually read it. Especially on Phones/tablets.\r\n> \r\n> I propose one of the following as a remedy, in personal order of preference:\r\n> \r\n> * Remove it entirely- provide only a handful of examples (in total) from the most prominent regions of the top providers (eg. us-east-1)\r\n> * Link to providers' pages of regions\r\n> * Move the list of regions to a separate page. This addresses only the difficulty of reading through the main S3 page. It does not reduce documentation maintenance.\r\n\r\nI think the best first step might be to make sure we only show one of each option type. For example we show `region` for each provider. If we just showed the first (which is AWS) then that would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThis will need a patch to the doc generator though\r\n\r\nIn fact looking at the doc generator it appears to have that in already, but it doesn't work!\r\n\r\nFixing it I get this which removes 1,369  lines of documentation making it almost half the size.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ wc -l s3.docs.0 s3.docs.1\r\n  2536 s3.docs.0\r\n  1167 s3.docs.1\r\n  3703 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've attached the before and after.
