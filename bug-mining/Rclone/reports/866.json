At least the traffic monitoring is showing low-Kilobytes, whereas in the earlier stages it was in the 100s of KB/s or at times MB/s.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncharles@laputa ~> rclone version\r\nrclone v1.54.0-beta.4811.e3a5bb9b4\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.14.6\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nJottacloud, and Hubic.\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```rclone -v sync --checkers 15 --transfers 15 hubic-crypt:archives/2019-02/home/ --exclude expect/** --exclude charles/projects/icons/backup/icons.db --exclude charles/music/** jottacloud-crypt:archives/2019-02/home/```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nI don't have logs with -vv I'm afraid, but I've got some with -v.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone -v sync --checkers 15 --transfers 15 hubic-crypt:archives/2019-02/home/ --exclude expect/** --exclude charles/projects/icons/backup/icons.db --exclude charles/music/** jottacloud-crypt:archives/2019-02/home/\r\n2020/10/12
