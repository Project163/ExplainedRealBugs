I think this is great since we finally can control the versioning. Would you like to take on this and open a PR?\r\n\r\nBut speaking of multiple versions created by rclone, IIRC rclone doesn't set the modtime afterwards now as @ncw described (except for [one trivial point](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2520#issuecomment-418427375)), so the extra versions _should_ only come from overwriting existing files... But things might have changed over time, so some more checking would be good. @Zvezdin Are you seeing multiple versions even for new files, or just for overwritten files?\r\n\r\nApart from that, a `cleanup` command would be good to have
