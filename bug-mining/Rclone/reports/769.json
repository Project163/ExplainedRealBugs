As per the docs @ https://rclone.org/docs/#exit-code, the exit-code should be `8` instead of `7` which indicates a fatal error.\r\n\r\nThis is just my guess from a brief overview of the related code, but I believe that the error stems from https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/7d70e9266446901e93a888212edd06765821047b/fs/sync/sync.go#L178-L183 where the actual error is added to which fails the eventual comparison test for the error type.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.47.0-062-g99bc013c-beta\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\n`Debian 9 64-bit`\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\n`Google Drive`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n`rclone sync Drive: DriveCopy: --tpslimit=5 --tpslimit-burst=50 --max-transfer=700G`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nRelevant Lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019/05/16 07:54:40 ERROR : Cancelling sync due to fatal error: Max transfer limit reached as set by --max-transfer\r\n2019/05/16 07:54:40 INFO  : Google drive root '': Waiting for checks to finish\r\n2019/05/16 07:54:40 INFO  : Google drive root '': Waiting for transfers to finish\r\n2019/05/16 07:54:41 INFO  : o6i2cgd36bmi2nva56ubo4a268/i28c365mh5iu29bbbq5h5bf960/q58f203e7ps6gblq0fu0f36954/o6omqo0u6b7sb4rjhdjf7qsmtg/dajheiohfhb8b7vag018ke\r\npaucfq3fau0kb3l75fqstcii04ch32jcj7p79rnv86jd6v4v8atj3p81pcq460pge65ut8p7n02ptt7eo: Copied (server side copy)\r\n2019/05/16 07:54:41 ERROR : Fatal error received - not attempting retries\r\n2019/05/16 07:54:41 Failed to sync: Max transfer limit reached as set by --max-transfer\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
