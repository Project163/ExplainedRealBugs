I just did the same thing with Mega and it worked:\r\n```\r\n$ ~/bin/rclone mount -v --debug-fuse  Mega: /tmp/db\r\n2018/09/11 07:48:42 INFO  : mega root '': poll-interval is not supported by this

me issues.\r\n\r\nAll of the above is based on:\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.43\r\n- os/arch: linux/arm\r\n- go version: go1.11\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want me to test a PR, I am happy to do it.\r\n\r\nDetailed
