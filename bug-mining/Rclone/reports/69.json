When transferring a file that is larger than the Max Object Size with Transfer-Encoding, the transfer does not fail until after the data has been transferred exceeding the Max Object Size.  However, when using Content-Length header instead a 413 Request Entity Too Large can be passed back immediately, and rclone can save the users bandwidth.\n1. Since the size is not transmitted, Rclone, must check the object after transmission with a HEAD request to ensure the size is correct and if wrong delete the object.  With Content-Length header if the data transmitted does not match the Content-Length given a 400 Bad Request (The data is invalid) will allow rclone to know a retransmit is required, and a delete will not be necessary as the object was not written.  This will also greatly aid systems like Swift that are eventually consistent, as the head after the transmission may not return data even though a 200 was given.  \n\nWhen using Content-Length the 200 given for a successful transfer will be trust worthy improving the speed and efficiency of rclone.\n\nThanks for the great software,\nDoug Soltesz\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
