I have verified your steps but rclone is bugged. That's why.\n#Test1 without large objects\n\nOn local folder i have different iso files. Each is less than 5 gb. On swift side, i have the same files but with different mtimes and sizes = 0 byte.\n\n---\n\nFirst run: I've tried to copy the files from local to hubic with -n -v\nfrom the log i see:\nfile1.iso have different mtimes. So it starts a md5 check. Spend 2 minutes to create md5sum and say:\nreturning empty md5sum for manifest file. after this : size of src and dst objects identical.\nThe files on swift have the mdsum in the etag, they are not large. Why it shouldn't be avaible?\n\nWTF!\nPoint1. It should check the size and not the mtimes at the beginning. It should compare local filesystem file size with swift content-length and for redundancy the size reported from listing folder.(here rclone should say that they  are  already different and not equal)\nPoint2. If you (rclone) haven't tried to compare the size why are you running an md5 check? Useless.\nI've started a copy without any options so it should compare first the size and if it is equal then the mtimes check. If the mtimes check fail then the md5 check. If the md5 isn't avaible then the files are the same. But on first run it should compare size and if them are different it should stop and mark them for copy!\n\nThe situation is the same for the other isos. \n\n---\n\nSecond run: I've tried to copy the files from local to hubic with -n -v -c\nNow rclone says in no time the sizes differ and mark it for copy. Good, it doesn't run the md5 check.\n\nTested also with little identical files, it checks the size and after the md5 check. Right\n\n---\n\nI'll report different tests on large obejcts but i have different questions:\n1) How does rclone check the size : content-legth or directory listing\n2) How does rclone identify large objects ?
