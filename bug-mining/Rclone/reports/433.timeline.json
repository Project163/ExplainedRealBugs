You'll lose the ability to check the sha1sum of the upload if you do that though.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/384297085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1594139340,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU5NDEzOTM0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1594139340","actor":{"login":"EuropeanaDevelopment","id":5096335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTYzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5096335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment","html_url":"https://github.com/EuropeanaDevelopment","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-25T13:59:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1594139342,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1OTQxMzkzNDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1594139342","actor":{"login":"EuropeanaDevelopment","id":5096335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTYzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5096335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment","html_url":"https://github.com/EuropeanaDevelopment","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-25T13:59:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/384301359","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2203#issuecomment-384301359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2203","id":384301359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDMwMTM1OQ==","user":{"login":"EuropeanaDevelopment","id":5096335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTYzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5096335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment","html_url":"https://github.com/EuropeanaDevelopment","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDevelopment/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EuropeanaDe
