If in any capacity we attempt to ask dircache for a path with a trailing slash such as `iso/` (which copyto automatically does), dircache will attempt to retrieve an ID of a folder with an empty name under `iso` folder and not the ISO folder itself. In uloz.to's case it obviously fails to find it and tries to create it, which fails because empty folder names are disallowed.\r\n\r\nBy eyeballing other backends, this is something they tend to deal with on their own, such as with the [canonical Box example](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/backend/box/box.go#L344), so I'll add handling it in the uloz.to backend as well. It may be worth considering this issue on the dircache level at some point to centralize the logic and simplify the backends.
