@ncw it seems one of the flags is broken in this version\r\n> \r\n> `Error: invalid argument \"128MB\" for \"--drive-chunk-size\" flag: parsing \"128MB\" as fs.SizeSuffix failed: strconv.ParseFloat: parsing \"128M\": invalid syntax`\r\n> \r\n\r\n@ajkis The unit symbol in `fs.SizeSuffix` is only one char, like `2b, 128m, 5G`.\r\n\r\n> Experimenting with this and comparing it to `10ms` I see that if you are doing small operations that don't normally return a 403 then it is slower than `100ms` as soon as the 403's kick in then they are the same.\r\n> \r\n> It looks like this threshold is about 100 transactions, so you can get ~100 transactions for \"free\" before the rate limiting kicks in. So I wonder if we should attempt to model that. This is something that https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/time/rate can already do so maybe we should be using that in the pacer.\r\n\r\nBeing able to burst requests is probably a really good feature when using `rclone mount`, as a default sleep time of `100ms` would slow it down substantially when only using requests sporadically.\r\n\r\nThe https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/time/rate package looks really promising for this.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/451109273/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"B4dM4n","id":448169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n","html_url":"https://github.com/B4dM4n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/B4dM4n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2052090151,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA1MjA5MDE1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2052090151","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-03T10:46:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2052090152,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNTIwOTAxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2052090152","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-03T10:46:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2052090155,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA1MjA5MDE1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2052090155","actor":{"login":"ajkis","id":23003132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAzMTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23003132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis","html_url":"https://github.com/ajkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajkis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-03T10:46:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2052090156,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNTIwOTAxNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2052090156","actor":{"login":"ajkis","id":23003132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAzMTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23003132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.
