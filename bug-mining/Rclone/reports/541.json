Output of `rclone version`\r\n```\r\n$ rclone version\r\nrclone v1.44\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.1\r\n```\r\n#### Describe the issue\r\n##### Short story\r\n`move` with `--dry-run` creates empty folders in Google Drive.\r\n##### Details\r\nOn a local machine, there is a folder `/tmp/move-source` with a file and sub-folder with another file:\r\n```\r\n$ ls -R\r\n.:\r\nnested-folder  source-file.txt\r\n\r\n./nested-folder:\r\nnested-source-file.txt\r\n```\r\nOn Google Drive (configured in `rclone` as `gdrive`), there is an empty folder `move-target`.\r\n\r\nExecute `rclone --dry-run move /tmp/move-source gdrive:/move-target`\r\nOutput is as expected:\r\n```\r\n2018/10/21 09:32:58 NOTICE: source-file.txt: Not moving as --dry-run\r\n2018/10/21 09:32:58 NOTICE: nested-folder/nested-source-file.txt: Not moving as --dry-run\r\n```\r\nBut there is a folder `nested-folder` created in Google Drive:\r\n```\r\nYou created an item in\r\n    move-target\r\n        nested-folder\r\n```\r\n#### Interesting facts\r\n* Running `copy` with the same setup does not create empty folders.\r\n* Running `sync` with the same setup does not create empty folders.\r\n* There was a similar issue fixed in 1.28: #342
