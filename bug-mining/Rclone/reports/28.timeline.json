would be quite a good performance optimisation...\n\nFor some remotes md5sum is easy to calculate (eg swift) and some it isn't (eg local filesystem), same with reading the modification time.\n\nIn the case of s3 and swift the md5sum is easy to fetch, whereas the modification time is harder as it requires an extra transaction - hence the difference in speed.\n\nTo implement the above I'd need to make each remote express a preference for md5sum/modification time or no preference, then `copy` and `sync` could take note of these.\n\nI'll have a think - thanks for the idea.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/101572929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":303629243,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwMzYyOTI0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/303629243","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-13T08:32:43Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"alexcouper","id":837734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzczNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper","html_url":"https://github.com/alexcouper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexcouper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-01T13:56:09Z","updated_at":"2015-06-01T13:56:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/71","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/71/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/71/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/71/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/71","id":83511535,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzY2MzA3ODE=","number":71,"title":"Sync
