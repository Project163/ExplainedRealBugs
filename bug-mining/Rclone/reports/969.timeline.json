What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nAvoid sometimes creating additional subdirectory in cache folder. It may happen as a result of \"detected overridden config - adding ... suffix to name\", where the suffix is base64 encoded MD5, when the encoded suffix happens to include the `/` character - which is in the base64 \"alphabet\".\r\n\r\nEdit: Is backwards compatibility an issue here? That there may be an existing cache directory `cache`\\\\`path`\\\\`{Db`\\\\`Y9}` with content, and after this change rclone will not find the existing cache and begin with a new cache directory `cache`\\\\`path`\\\\`{Db_Y9}`? And then, any changes still in the old cache that has not been written back to remote will be lost? 🤔 \r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #5316\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [X] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [X] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [X] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4707674084,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ3MDc2NzQwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4707674084","actor":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c79acd6d40ea685b90742e4ae7a2e59510cdfa59","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/albertony/rclone/commits/c79acd6d40ea685b90742e4ae7a2e59510cdfa59","created_at":"2021-05-08T12:50:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/835350119","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5316#issuecomment-835350119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5316","id":835350119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNTM1MDExOQ==","user":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-08T12:54:00Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T12:54:00Z","body":"Is your primary issue that the cache contains an additional subdirectory with name \"Y9\" within \"D:\\rc\\vfs\\BookY{Db\"?
