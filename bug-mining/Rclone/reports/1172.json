What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n1.55.0\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nHelp users easily have a redacted rclone config to quickly submit a ticket.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nCurrently we can mark backend options with [Option.IsPassword](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/v1.54.1/fs/fs.go#L140)\r\nwhich triggers a special interactive prompt during `rclone config`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to it we can introduce new `Option.Sensitive`.\r\nSensitive options will be redacted by the new command `rclone config show --redacted`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5209/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
