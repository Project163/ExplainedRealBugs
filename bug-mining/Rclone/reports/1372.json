The [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-createuploadsession?view=graph-rest-1.0#upload-bytes-to-the-upload-session) says this:\n\n_Using a fragment size that doesn't divide evenly by 320 KiB results in errors committing some files._\n\nIn these cases, the files are smaller than 320 KiB, and the chunk size is the file size, which does not divide envenly by 320 KiB. I can't be sure, but it would seem that files smaller than that threshold should be uploaded outside of the multipart semantics, but I can't find a way to make that happen.\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\n`v1.69.1`\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nWindows Server, 64 bit\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
