I've been looking into cleanup for amazonclouddrive, box, dropbox and onedrive.\r\n\r\n**amazonclouddrive**: There doesn't seem to be any documentation on permanently deleting trashed items with the Amazon Cloud Drive API. [Docs](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/experience/cloud-drive/content/restful-api-getting-started)\r\n\r\n**box**: The Box API provides an endpoint for [listing trashed items](https://developer.box.com/reference#get-the-items-in-the-trash) and [permanently deleting trashed items](https://developer.box.com/reference#permanently-delete-a-trashed-file). However, there's no endpoint for permanently deleting trashed items and the Box API does not support batch API calls. Cleanup is not feasible since it involves listing all trashed items and making a delete request for each item.

From my understanding, it is not yet supported.
