could you add the flag so rclone would exit on cloud errors.\r\nIt quite big problem with dropbox where unlimited disk space its actually ask for more space when you reach 75%.\r\n\r\nOnce you hit the upload limit ( eg disk full ) rclone keeps uploading to 100% only to report at end that upload path is full and then continue for other files. \r\n\r\nBasically its using all the bandwith just not saving the file at the end.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is if google drive gets locked ( after 10TB download ) and then its just reporting bad response 403 forbidden.\r\n\r\nI suggest 2 flags are added --exit-on-full and -exit-on-forbidden so if rclone encounters those errors it should exit.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1885/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1378283152,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM3ODI4MzE1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1378283152","actor":{"login":"PiscisSwimeatus","id":4976642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzY2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4976642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus","html_url":"https://github.com/PiscisSwimeatus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PiscisSwimeatus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-12-08T06:23:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1497713094,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0OTc3MTMwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1497713094","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fdebf9da317e837693b16c2f683bd87974707fee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/fdebf9da317e837693b16c2f683bd87974707fee","created_at":"2018-02-28T21:28:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
