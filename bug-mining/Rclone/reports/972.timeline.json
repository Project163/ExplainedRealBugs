:-)\r\n\r\nSo you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.53.3\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15.5\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nthe documentation needs to be update for the supported hashes for command `hashsum`\r\n https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_hashsum/#synopsis\r\nfrom \r\n```\r\nSupported hashes are:\r\n  * MD5\r\n  * SHA-1\r\n  * DropboxHash\r\n  *

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nSpelling of hash names in rclone is rather unusual.\r\n`SHA-1` contains dash while `MD5` and `CRC32` don't. All three are upper case.\r\nIn the same time `DropboxHash` and `MailruHash` carry the `Hash` suffix and use camel case,\r\nwhile `Whirlpool` doesn't have the suffix.\r\n\r\nKeeping this in mind can be problematic for average user.\r\nThe `hashsum` command won't print the correct spelling if you make a mistake.\r\nIt does help you if you run it without arguments, but the help message will miss a few hashes.\r\n\r\nThis pull request seeks to:\r\n1. Unify all hashsum names as\r\n    **lower case alphanumeric words without punctuation**:\r\n    `rclone hashsum sha1 ...`, `crc32`, `quickxor`, etc\r\n2. Accept legacy names as aliases so existing rclone wrappers continue to work.\r\n    They can be used but disappear from documentation from now on.\r\n    Probably a depreciation warning could be printed but I'd rather leave it for a later PR.\r\n3. Make `rclone hashsum` print supported hash list in case of:\r\n    (a) wrong hash name spelling (b) no arguments (h) --help\r\n4. Keep documentation up-to-date\r\n5. Replace O(N) list lookups in `fs/hash/hash.go` by O(1) map lookups.\r\n    Not a massive performance improvement but makes code look better.\r\n\r\nThere is one more item that could have been done, but I need advice:\r\n\r\n6. Ignore case of hash names supplied by user so that upper-case or\r\n    mixed-case would be accepted too (lower-case still being canonical),\r\n    e.g. `rclone hashsum SHA1 ...` or `DropBox`.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #5071 \r\nFixes #4841\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution
