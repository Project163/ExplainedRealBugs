For Blob Storage, there are two different kinds of SAS, one is an account level SAS which gives you access to all containers (or other storage products in this account if it's allowed, like tables or queues), the other one is a service level SAS which will give you access to a specific container (or file). \r\n\r\nFor an account level SAS, you'll only need a different constructor - instead of https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/storage#NewClient you'll either need https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/storage#NewAccountSASClient, https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/storage#NewAccountSASClientFromEndpointToken or https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/storage#NewClientFromConnectionString, depending on which info you have. _NewClientFromConnectionString_ is probably the best one, since a connection string covers every connection method for account-level access:\r\n\r\n* Access with an account key: \r\n`DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<ACCOUNTNAME>;AccountKey=<ACCOUNTKEY>;BlobEndpoint=https://<ACCOUNTNAME>.blob.core.windows.net/;`\r\n* With an SAS:\r\n`SharedAccessSignature=sv=2017-04-17&ss=bt&srt=sco&sp=rl&st=2018-03-20T20%3A13%3A00Z&se=2018-03-21T20%3A13%3A00Z&sig=<SIGNATURE>;BlobEndpoint=https://<ACCOUNTNAME>.blob.core.windows.net/;`\r\n\r\nIMHO it would be great to be able to either configure an Azure Blob Storage remote storage using the traditional way (account name, key, endpoint) for backwards compatibility or with a connection string, which covers everything supported by the SDK, including the former.\r\n\r\nA service level SAS is a bit different. An SAS for a single file doesn't make much sense for rclone since it's just used to give access to a single file, but a container SAS might be useful. Using an SAS URL you can get a container instance using https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/storage#GetContainerReferenceFromSASURI and from there a Client instance again https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/storage#Container.Client  \r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/374721144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maetthu","id":1193955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1193955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu","html_url":"https://github.com/maetthu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/375242236","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2118#issuecomment-375242236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2118","id":375242236,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTI0MjIzNg==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-22T10:04:04Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T10:04:04Z","body":"@maetthu thank you for the writeup - very helpful :-)\r\n\r\nSo it looks like adding access via `NewClientFromConnectionString` would be useful.

thanks for testing that :-)\r\n\r\n> Authentication from connection string works\r\n\r\nHooray!\r\n\r\n> SAS in connection string reports following error:\r\n\r\nI note this in the docs - did you set https?\r\n\r\n> DefaultEndpointsProtocol=[http|https];\r\n\r\nThis error\r\n\r\n> error reading source directory: directory not found\r\n\r\nLooks like it is almost working... \r\n\r\nIf you wanted to do a bit more debugging with the code I posted, then I recommend using `-vv --dump bodies` which will show all the HTTP transactions - that usually helps a lot.\r\n\r\n> SAS url reports\r\n\r\n> error reading source directory: Get ?comp=list&delimiter=%2F&include=metadata&maxresults=5000&restype=container: unsupported protocol scheme \"\"\r\n\r\nThis looks like the URL is missing a protocol scheme, likely an `https:\\\\`  In fact it looks like it is missing the rest of the URL.  Did you put in something like \"https://host.com/stuff` here?\r\n\r\n`--dump bodies` may throw some light.\r\n\r\nI've had interactions with the Azure Go devs and they indicated to me that the preferred package is now https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-blob-go - however that package doesn't look particularly mature to me yet!  Also it is a lot of work swapping a backend implementation :-(\r\n\r\n@memotype Thanks for the comment!  As far as this feature goes, happy to pull existing features out of the SDK, but I really don't have enough time to dive into the rabbit hole of the Microsoft auth system so really appreciate your help @maetthu.  Assuming we can get enough of this working to be useful, I'll ask for some help writing the docs too!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/376654501/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1544100507,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU0NDEwMDUwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1544100507","actor":{"login":"maetthu","id":1193955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1193955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu","html_url":"https://github.com/maetthu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-27T19:57:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1544100509,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NDQxMDA1MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1544100509","actor":{"login":"maetthu","id":1193955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1193955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu","html_url":"https://github.com/maetthu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maetthu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-27T19:57:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1544100511,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU0NDEwMDUxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1544100511","actor":{"login":"memotype","id":2773185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzMxODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2773185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype","html_url":"https://github.com/memotype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/memotype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-27T19:57:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1544100513,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NDQxMDA1MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1544100513","actor":{"login":"memotype","id":2773185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzMxODU=","av
