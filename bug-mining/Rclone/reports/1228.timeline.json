Intro\r\n\r\nThe bisync pull request #5164 appeared too large to fulfil in a single rclone release.\r\n\r\nPlan is to merge it right after the rclone v1.57 release. The command will be available in the beta builds for a limited circle of beta testers until official release with rclone v1.58.\r\nDuring the beta period we can merge a number of postponed items, **in particular breaking changes**.\r\n\r\nThis ticket will keep track of the most beta time changes. Large and critical changes will be split into separate tickets.\nHigh priority items reflect changes breaking user experience and must be completed before 1.58. Medium priority items are required but not guaranteed by 1.58. Optional and low priority items will be implemented on best effort basis. Optional items don't even have dedicated tickets yet.\r\n\r\n### High priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Track critical flags in saved sessions - #5678\r\n- [ ] Support imprecise or absent modtimes - #5679\r\n- [ ] Use hashsums, honor `--checksum` - #5683\r\n\r\n### Medium priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check file sizes - #5684\r\n- [ ] Respect `--backup-dir` - #5685\r\n- [ ] Align `--max-delete` semantics - #5680\r\n- [ ] Optimize resync - #5681\r\n- [ ] Track renames - #5690\r\n\r\n### Low priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Handle deletion conflicts - #5691\r\n- [ ] Honor `--interactive` and `--auto-confirm`\r\n- [ ] Recover after transient failures - #5676\r\n- [ ] Use **trie** for listings to reduce footprint - #5686\r\n- [ ] Maintain session history - #5692\r\n- [ ] Handle Google Docs better - #5696\r\n\r\n### Optional items\r\n\r\n- [ ] Parallelize move/rename operations\r\n- [ ] Honor special `.rcignore` files\r\n- [ ] Revisit progress display for bisync\r\n- [ ] Handle case-insensitive filenames. Respect `--ignore-case` and `--ignore-case-sync` ([rcsync#54](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/54), [#4854](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4854))\r\n- [ ] Synchronize empty dirs if supported by backend ([rcsync#63](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/63))\r\n- [ ] Fix tests for Google Photos ([rcsync#53](https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/53), [G.Photos issues](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Google+Photos%22))\r\n- [ ] Enable CI tests with OwnCloud (according to @cjnaz it's stable)\n- [ ] Test should handle Dropbox \"touch quirks\" in a generic way\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nSeveral `bisync` bug fixes and new features including `--create-empty-src-dirs` and equality check.\r\nDescribed in (excruciating) detail [here](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636). And further articulated in the [proposed documentation changes](https://github.com/nielash/rclone/blob/256892d85c0f13934988bd64731e19e119836be5/docs/content/bisync.md).\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=1.%20Dry%20runs%20are%20not%20completely%20dry) causing dry runs to inadvertently commit filter changes\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=2.%20%2D%2Dresync%20deletes%20data%2C%20contrary%20to%20docs) causing `--resync` to erroneously delete empty folders and duplicate files unique to Path2\r\n* `--check-access` is now enforced during `--resync`, preventing data loss in [certain user error scenarios](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=%2D%2Dcheck%2Daccess%20doesn%27t%20always%20fail%20when%20it%20should)\r\n* Fixed an [issue](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=5.%20Bisync%20reads%20files%20in%20excluded%20directories%20during%20delete%20operations) causing bisync to consider more files than necessary due to overbroad filters during delete operations\r\n* [Improved detection of false positive change conflicts](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=1.%20Identical%20files%20should%20be%20left%20alone%2C%20even%20if%20new/newer/changed%20on%20both%20sides) (identical files are now left alone instead of renamed)\r\n* Added [support for `--create-empty-src-dirs`](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=3.%20Bisync%20should%20create/delete%20empty%20directories%20as%20sync%20does%2C%20when%20%2D%2Dcreate%2Dempty%2Dsrc%2Ddirs%20is%20passed)\r\n* Added experimental `--resilient` mode to allow [recovery from self-correctable errors](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=2.%20Bisync%20should%20be%20more%20resilient%20to%20self%2Dcorrectable%20errors)\r\n* Added [new `--ignore-listing-checksum` flag](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=6.%20%2D%2Dignore%2Dchecksum%20should%20be%20split%20into%20two%20flags%20for%20separate%20purposes) to distinguish from `--ignore-checksum`\r\n* [Performance improvements](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=6.%20Deletes%20take%20several%20times%20longer%20than%20copies) for large remotes\r\n* Documentation and testing improvements\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes, mainly in this forum post:\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636\r\n\r\nIt also fixes #6109 and addresses several other open issues: #6841 #5683 #5681 #5676 #5675 #5674\r\n\r\n####

What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nBisync fails when files are added during bisync operation. Typically, files are added to the Path1 source (GCS), causing Listing1 to include files not actually copied. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the final Path1 Listing does not match the Path2 Listing. Hence, the bisync is marked as \"failed\" and the succeeding runs fail as well.\r\n\r\n**Error flow**\r\n* [Optimistic copy at end of bisync-operation](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/ce3b65e6dc0866cac041b82aabbf790ebd9778b6/cmd/bisync/operations.go#L263)\r\n* [Error triggered by checkSync at end of bisync-operation](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/ce3b65e6dc0866cac041b82aabbf790ebd9778b6/cmd/bisync/operations.go#L295)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution area**\r\nAs we update files based on deltas, it makes sense to also update the Listing1 and Listing2 fileLists based on these deltas, instead of scanning the source and destination folders.\r\n\r\nTo do so, the copy operation needs to return the actual updates as well. Currently, `fastCopy` only returns the error details. By including the actual updates, we have the information to update the listing. Sadly, this information needs to propagate quite some layers and modules, from actual background transfers up to the bisync module.\r\n\r\n* [Queued delta execution reference](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/ce3b65e6dc0866cac041b82aabbf790ebd9778b6/cmd/bisync/deltas.go#L253)\r\n* [fastCopy reference](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/98fd00a655cada0bda53b7be3d54dd656a8ab21c/cmd/bisync/queue.go#L14)\r\n* [copyDir reference](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/98fd00a655cada0bda53b7be3d54dd656a8ab21c/fs/sync/sync.go#L1126)\r\n* [run copy reference](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/98fd00a655cada0bda53b7be3d54dd656a8ab21c/fs/sync/sync.go#L844)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n1.61.1\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nWindows Server 2022, 64 bit\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud Storage and Local File Storage (Windows)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n`bisync gcs:/ C:\\clone\\`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nSadly I haven't got an actual log of the issue. The script runs in the background on my server and fails every now and then.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nbisync delta engine and unit tests do not take backend time tolerance into account. this should be fixed.\r\n\r\n## modtime in unit tests\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#discussion_r634229878 (ivandeex)\r\n\r\nthe unit test runner is based on `mangleListing` which is a very far relative of [fstest.CompareItems](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/v1.55.1/fstest/fstest.go#L356). It already has ability to ignore hashsums on demand. It still needs ability to compare times with per-backend tolerance or even ignore times if unsupported. Having that would let us run tests against backends without time support and probably lift the corresponding ban.\r\n\r\nTentatively this can be implemented as:\r\n1. parse out the time filed and convert to `time.Time`\r\n2. round time down to _doubled_ tolerance\r\n3. put time field back into string\r\n4. feed the result to `diff`.\r\n\r\nWhy not just parse and compare with tolerance?\r\nBecause `mangleResult` is two-fold. Besides comparing it can prepare a test state snapshot for storing in golden directory, which later can provide a **bigger picture** of what's going on.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-843151817 (ivandeex)\r\n\r\nWith a feature _must_ come a method of testing it.\r\n\r\nRclone has a comprehensive `fstest` framework dedicated to peculiarities of the plethora of supported cloud providers. Planning to work on this patch I had the heart to keep the project test engine's nature (while translating it from python to golang and refactoring it to work natively/unattended on Windows and with a wider set of backends) and propose it as a new kid on the set of rclone approaches (see my inline comment above), instead of rewriting it from the grounds up for `fstest`.\r\n\r\nThe bisync test suite **lacks** the ability to compare imprecise/absent timestamps as of the time of this writing (I hope I can say it, _absent_ timestamps should be \"comparable\" too). It works correctly mostly because it compares logs from a particular filesystem **with itself**. Unless this ward is fixed, we _can't run tests_ against backends without modtime and consequently can't declare them supported. I have an idea on how to fix that (see another inline comment), but the effort will need time.\r\n\r\n## modtime in delta engine\r\n\r\nTry to extend `operations.Equal` into `operations.Compare` with more returned conditions like `Newer, Older, ...` (related to #4810) for direct use in bisync delta engine\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-842407758 (JWink3101)\r\n\r\nThe fact that this only supports a small subset of remotes is disappointing, esp. some popular ones not supporting mod time. Others, like S3, are way more performant if you disable it.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue with the overall algorithm of some sync tools but there is no reason you *need* modtime to decide what to sync. You may need it for *conflicts* but if you have past state, then you can tell if a changed file-size is a modification on one side only.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#issuecomment-842512914 (ivandeex)\r\n\r\n> This is an issue with the overall algorithm of some sync tools but there is no reason you _need_ modtime to decide what to sync.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, no. The bisync change detection in its current state is all about [bit masks](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164/files#diff-25f7d45d3740899fdbbb93ff87a682943b7085b9c2f7f67b9cc58756c90e3630R31) (as opposed to \"rclonic\" [Equal](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/v1.55.1/fs/operations/operations.go#L167)). But it needs more testing.\r\n\r\n## How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

https://forum.rclone.org/t/what-is-rclone-checking-during-a-purge/35931 this needs more work.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this work properly, the checkers and transfers need to be unified into a single datastructure. They need to be properly reference counted.\r\n\r\nIf a transfer is started, then if a checker is started on the same file then it should return the existing transfer but update the tag while the checker is running.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

is a feature request for the ability to access a complete list of files transferred/deleted by Sync/Copy/Move, as well as their basic attributes and any errors encountered. This is similar to [`rclone check`](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/)'s ability to output lists for `MissingOnDst`, `MissingOnSrc`, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile this would be a nice feature in general for many reasons, I am primarily interested because it's currently the blocking issue for [Bisync's biggest bug](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5676).\r\n\r\n<details open>\r\n<summary>\r\n\r\n ### Prior discussion (from #6797)</summary>\r\n\r\n@nielash:\r\n> Just wanted to mention, in case it's related to the work you're planning here, that it would be really helpful for [future `bisync` work](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5676) to have an easy way to access a complete list of transfers. Similar to [`accounting.Stats(ctx).Transferred()`](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/25703ad20ed34a8990fc02913e17a74692050d21/fs/accounting/stats.go#L492-L506), but that one is limited to `MaxCompletedTransfers` (100) and doesn't include `modtime` or `hash`. My hope is to use this to avoid having to re-list each fs at the end of a bisync run to find out what happened during the `syncCopyMove` operations, as re-listing is more expensive and [error-prone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6841).\r\n>\r\n> If this maybe already exists and I'm missing it, please let me know 😃 I see how to access the total number of transfers/errors, but we would need a list to reconcile it with the initial directory listings to build the \"after\" snapshot. If keeping the full transfer list in memory is a concern, we could potentially work with just a list of errored transfers (and infer that anything not on this list was successful and now matches what we passed in.) But this is not entirely foolproof, as it leaves open the possibility that files changed in between the listing and copying.\r\n\r\n@ncw:\r\n\r\n> That isn't quite what is under discussion here, but what I think you want is something like we have for `operations.Check` where you can pass in `io.Writer`s to have the file names written to.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> type CheckOpt struct {\r\n> \tFdst, Fsrc   fs.Fs     // fses to check\r\n> \tCheck        checkFn   // function to use for checking\r\n> \tOneWay       bool      // one way only?\r\n> \tCombined     io.Writer // a file with file names with leading sigils\r\n> \tMissingOnSrc io.Writer // files only in the destination\r\n> \tMissingOnDst io.Writer // files only in the source\r\n> \tMatch        io.Writer // matching files\r\n> \tDiffer       io.Writer // differing files\r\n> \tError        io.Writer // files with errors of some kind\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> If you read the docs for [rclone check](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) you'll see the bits about outputting file names to files. People have asked for exactly this for sync/copy/move and I think this internal inteface would suit your requirements too.\r\n> \r\n> I should probably change the `io.Writer` into a `func(remote string) error` to explicitly say it will be called with a path each time. We'd need a way of signalling high level retries also as the functions potentially get called each high level retry.\r\n\r\n@nielash:\r\n\r\n> Yes, this would be great! (I used this recently in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/5ca61ab70543abf740999b874ed65ec3ffc890cf.) For bisync purposes I think we'd also need the `size`, `modtime`, and `hash` in addition to the list of names (at least to the extent that `syncCopyMove` already has this info -- and I think it does, as that's how it knows if a file is \"corrupted on transfer\".)</details>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, it would also be important to know whether each operation was a copy or delete, and whether it had an error. The end goal is to update the initial listing, which uses this format:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/b750c50bfd4440e88cc66c718ca20e0892f6404f/cmd/bisync/listing.go#L27-L32\r\n\r\nSee also: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3933\r\n- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5676\r\n- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6841\r\n- [Forum discussion](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-bugs-and-feature-requests/37636#:~:text=5.%20Final%20listings%20should%20be%20created%20from%20initial%20snapshot%20%2B%20deltas%2C%20not%20full%20re%2Dscans%2C%20to%20avoid%20errors%20if%20files%20changed%20during%20sync)\r\n- A [recent user post](https://forum.rclone.org/t/bisync-missed-syncing-changed-file-no-error-no-warning/41174) about this bug\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

this is likely when resync is run when data is already present vs copying the data itself.. There are no changes made to files when moving between a --resync and normal run.  \r\n\r\ndefaults:\r\n\tresync: 10m47.0s\r\n\tnormal: 6m44.7s\r\n\r\ndefaults with ignore checksum: (--ignore-listing-checksum --ignore-checksum)\r\n\tresync: 10m36.5s\r\n\tnormal: 6m31.9s\r\n\r\n### overview\r\n\r\nSo as you can see bisync is orders of magnitude slower than `copy` or `sync` . `ls` is incredibly fast as is `sync` and `copy` in both directions (e.g. uses up almost 100% of bandwidth)\r\n\r\nI only ran the test of `lsl` and `ls` at the very end and now thinking that bisync relies on lsl as this so incredibly slow (as I believe bisync does not use checksum so would need `lsl` info to compare?).\r\n\r\nI can do a local to crypt (local) bisync in 15s (--resync) and 8.7s for subsequent. \r\n\r\nIs there something I am doing wrong? If not, are there plans/options available to rclone to improve the speed of bisync so that it is more in line with 2 x sync/copy commands (e.g. one upload, one download) or is this a limitation that is unlikely to be overcome? Also, if this is due to lsl taking so long is there a way to speed up lsl? \r\n\r\nThanks to you all for your hard work and a special thank you @nielash for all you've been doing on bisync and continue to do. I as many others massively appreciate it and when this tool is out of experimental stages it will be a game changer for so many. If I had any free time or money right now I would help out but unfortunately the best I can do is give you some benchmarks and user feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nA suite of several related fixes tackling bisync's biggest pain points.\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n- bisync: merge copies and deletes, support `--track-renames` and `--backup-dir` -- fixes #5690 and #5685\r\n- operations: add logger to log list of sync results -- fixes #7282\r\n- sync: report list of synced paths to file -- see #7282\r\n- bisync: generate final listing from sync results, not relisting - fixes #5676\r\n- bisync: rollback listing on sync error\r\n- bisync: generate listings concurrently with march -- fixes #7332\r\n- sync: `--fix-case` flag to rename case insensitive dest -- fixes #4854\r\n- bisync: handle unicode and case normalization consistently - fixes #7270\r\n- bisync: optimize `--resync` performance -- partially addresses #5681\r\n- bisync: add support for Google Docs - fixes #5696\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes.
