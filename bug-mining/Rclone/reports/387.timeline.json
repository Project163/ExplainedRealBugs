authenticate. The library tries once; if it manages, all goes well (as this is the behaviour when the token is valid). Otherwise, it tries to reauthenticate, but in this case there is some unallocated memory that is referenced.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is due to a problem in the swift library itself, or because in rclone some internal variables of the connection object are not set up properly, or something else...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ncw/swift/issues/108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ncw/swift/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/351716293","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1919#issuecomment-351716293","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1919","id":351716293,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MTcxNjI5Mw==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-14T13:52:35Z","updated_at":"2017-12-14T13:52:35Z","body":"@giovannipizzi
