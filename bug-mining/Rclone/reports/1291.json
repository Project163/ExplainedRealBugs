We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nrclone v1.54.0-beta.4889.45e8bea8d\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15.3\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nWith rclone copy, and --multi-thread-streams set to 4, I get speeds of up to 40 MB/s whereas the same with rclone mount gives me only 10 MB/s (which is equal to the value obtained via rclone copy with the number of streams set to 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nAdd support for multi-threaded downloads when downloading a file to the vfs cache. Per @ncw and this thread (https://forum.rclone.org/t/multi-threaded-downloads-comments-and-testers-needed/9721/18), this was present in the previous iteration of the full-mode cache but was removed to add support for partial downloads/streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add. It's just extra noise for everyone subscribed to this issue.\r\n* Subscribe to receive notifications on status change and new comments.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4760/reactions","total_count":96,"+1":89,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":7,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
