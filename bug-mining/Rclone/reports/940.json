directories:\r\n```\r\nD:\\001\\004\r\nD:\\002\r\nD:\\003\r\nD:\\005\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following command works, but will unexpectedly create empty directories E:\\003 and E:\\005:\r\n\r\n`rclone copy D:\\ E:\\ --include {001/**,002/**} --create-empty-src-dirs`\r\n\r\nThe following alternatives avoids the unexpected empty directories:\r\n\r\n`rclone copy D:\\ E:\\ --include 001/** --include 002/** --create-empty-src-dirs`\r\n\r\n`rclone copy D:\\ E:\\ --include {001,002}/** --create-empty-src-dirs`\r\n\r\nThis is a limitation in the filtering implementation, as documented in code:\r\n\r\n> // Can't deal with / or ** in {}\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/d260e3824e15702040db2cecaa49ced852d07d6d/fs/filter/glob.go#L124-L125\r\n\r\n> // Can't figure this one out so return any

expected for files, but rclone is not able to use this filter to exclude directories from being traversed. Without `--create-empty-src-dirs` you will not notice (except perhaps performance), but with it any (traversed) directories that are empty will be created, leading to a little surprise..\r\n\r\nThis issue comes from the discussion in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5069, which were closed due to described workarounds.","closed_by":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
