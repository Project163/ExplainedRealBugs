Should not be a problem normally but some very edge cases.\r\n\r\nYes you are right. The first version didn't write the files out to disk, but then I wanted to use the sync and check primitives which run in parallel etc.\r\n\r\nIf the writing out to disk fails then rclone should error then so hopefully it will make a sensible error message!\r\n\r\nI've merged this to master now which means it will be in [the latest beta](https://beta.rclone.org/) in 15-30 minutes and released in v1.64\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1666348675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10185619122,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M5tYc5wzwAAAAJfHDay","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10185619122","actor":{"login":"leekiernan","id":946518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjUxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan","html_url":"https://github.com/leekiernan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leekiernan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7ecf765c74be59729f5982969d87cf938d992ea5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/leekiernan/rclone/commits/7ecf765c74be59729f5982969d87cf938d992ea5","created_at":"2023-08-24T20:10:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11635039400,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M5tYc5wzwAAAAK1gJyo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/11635039400","actor":{"login":"deyarchit","id":4198802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTg4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4198802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit","html_url":"https://github.com/deyarchit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deyarchit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d362db2e080c83c6f320c786f09947b0bdce85b5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/deyarchit/rclone/commits/d362db2e080c83c6f320c786f09947b0bdce85b5","created_at":"2024-01-30T00:42:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
