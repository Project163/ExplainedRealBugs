We love that!\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\n\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\n\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\n\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\n\nLooking forward to your great idea!\n\nThe Rclone Developers\n\n-->\n\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\n\nN/A\n\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\n\n1.71.1\n\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\n\nI'd expect that if rclone needs to create a segments container it would use the same storage policy of the base container. It doesn't, it uses either the policy configured for the remote in rclone.conf (etc) or the default policy configured for Swift.\n\nX-Storage-Policy for the base container is fetched, and is available to rclone.\n\nHow this exhibits is our customers may naively create a multi region replicated container for the segments when they intended it to be single region - as used for the base container.\n\nI just ran into this while testing some other behaviour.\n\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\n\nIf storage_policy isn't set locally, then X-Storage-Policy from the base container should be used when creating the segments container.\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
