 2020-11-19 17:00 UTC, a newly discovered security vulnerability in rclone was published. As described in [this post by **ncw**](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783), the vulnerability affects some randomly generated passwords and tokens. If you are running rclone on your PC, Mac or server,...\r\n* Update rclone to the latestes version (`1.53.3` as of writing this notice).\r\n* Review the linked security information for further information.  **You may have to change your crypt passwords.**\r\n\r\n### Security of RCX\r\nWe have analysed the sitation and have so far determined that RCX is **not affected**.  \r\n\r\nRCX uses its own password generation mechanism with a secure source of randomness. However, our analysis has shown that we don't yet completely use the provided keyspace for maximum entropy, and will further increase this in a future update.\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\nAs described in the linked issue, the following functionalities were affected by this issue:\r\n\r\n*    `fs/config/config.go: Password = random.Password`\r\n      * RCX does not use this function\r\n*    `fs/rc/rcserver/rcserver.go: randomPass, err := random.Password(128)`\r\n      * RCX does not use this function\r\n *  `lib/oauthutil/oauthutil.go: state, err := random.Password(128)`\r\n      * This is not a security vulnerability in RCX\r\n\r\n### Security of rclone on Termux\r\n**If you are using rclone on Termux, the security information as referenced below also applies**. The update PR [has already been merged](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/6049) and is available via `pkg upgrade`.\r\n\r\n###

It is a feature rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces. Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard transfer protocols.\r\n\r\n*Rclone* has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp, mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax includes shell pipeline support, and --dry-run protection. It is used at the command line, in scripts or via its API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why I am making the suggestion\r\n\r\n<!-- Anything you would like to tell us about the software? -->\r\n\r\n*Rclone* is basically *rsync* on steroids. and their (experimental) web GUI is a game changer.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My connection with the software\r\n\r\n<!-- Are you the author? Enthustiastic or early adopter? Friends with the author or requested by them to open the isue? An employee of the software maker? -->\r\n\r\nNo affiliation.\r\n\r\n- [X] I will keep the issue up-to-date if something I have said changes or I remember a connection with the
