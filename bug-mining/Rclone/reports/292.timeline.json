I see two options, allow hte changing of hte time stamps (which google drive allows I believe) or have a flag(s) to disable the destination time modification.\r\n\r\nrclone, however, should be able to write correctly to its own mount. :)  I would think the right approach would be to have the mount update the times if possible.  I think some of the underlying storage supports this (local does and gdrive?).  For ones that do not support this, perhaps the fuse/mount should silently fail instead of throwing errors?\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/283696799","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1197#issuecomment-283696799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1197","id":283696799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzY5Njc5OQ==","user":{"login":"michael-stief","id":15268888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjY4ODg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15268888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-stief","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-stief/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-02T16:08:42Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T16:09:26Z","body":"Oh okay.

Apart from the issue of finding the WriteFileHandle, this would probably cause errors when `cp` calls `close`. I discarded that idea.\r\n\r\n2. Running `Setattr` async when needed. I wrote a patch for this approach, that appears to work:\r\nhttps://github.com/breunigs/rclone/commit/96702a5d606920f8cb948c3f271e9d91eb2f7864 \r\n\r\nThe patch is huge mostly due to refactoring and left-in debug output. There's only two important bits: `setModTime` gets called async if there is no `o`, but there are still writers. To avoid a race condition, I had to move decrementing the writers counter until after we close the pipe and finish the writing call.\r\n\r\nObviously, the async code path is rather brittle: if finishing up writing takes too long, setting the attribute will timeout and fail, but the code pretended earlier that everything was fine. All in all I don't think this is a good approach.\r\n\r\n3. Queuing up to 1 setAttr call (or just modTime for now) and resolving that once `fh.file.setObject(fh.o)` gets called. It might be possible to even hand down the error in this scenario (i.e. \"failed to write attributes\" error on flush/closeing the file. I'll have to give that some more thought

I'm really grateful for your help and the fast implementation and also @ncw for making rclone happen in the first place.\r\n\r\nFor 2 hours now I tried to produce any errors. Copying a lot of small files, using rsync -aP, copying files >1GB with Finder - this implementation works flawlessly. All timestamps are preserved now :)\r\n\r\nStill noticed one error which occurs when a lot of small files are involved (50 files, 36 MB, operation duration 4 min):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cp -aR test gdc/\r\ncp: failed to close 'gdc/test/42.png': Input/output error\r\ncp: failed to close 'gdc/test/34.jpg': Input/output error\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone mount -v gdc: ~/gdc\r\n2017/04/01 22:24:21 INFO  : Encrypted Google drive root 'rclone': Modify window is 1ms\r\n2017/04/01 22:26:15 ERROR : test/42.png: WriteFileHandle.Flush error: googleapi: Error 403: Rate Limit Exceeded, rateLimitExceeded\r\n2017/04/01 22:27:56 ERROR : test/34.jpg: WriteFileHandle.Flush error: googleapi: Error 403: Rate Limit Exceeded, rateLimitExceeded\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don't think it has something to with your code and happened before already. But now that timestamps are preserved I'm finally motivated to dig into the documentation and hopefully find something to prevent this from happening - maybe there are some flags for retries, rate limits or any other option so Finder honors the I/O fails and doesn't just continue it's work as if nothing happened, because right now this results in data loss when I move files instead of creating just a
