(More than 1000 open connections so it's running into the file descriptor limit)\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.43.1\r\n- os/arch: freebsd/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nJottacloud\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrclone serve restic\r\n\r\nI haven't managed to reproduce this intentionally and it has only happened on 2 occasions so far but I'm still trying to do so. I already rechecked the Jottacloud backend but all connections opened there should get closed so I doubt it's related to this backend. Will update this if I manage to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
