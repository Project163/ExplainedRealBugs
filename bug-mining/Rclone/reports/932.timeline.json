wrote on the forum\r\n\r\n> I think an additional flag something like --azureblob-public-access with value would suffice here. And this flag would be useful during sync/copy/mkdir command where if the container does not exist (or even exists), it should create with that additional public access level parameter.\r\n> \r\n> azureblob-public-access <blob/container>\r\n> \r\n> Command\r\n> \r\n> rclone mkdir --azureblob-public-access blob azure:mydemocontainer\r\n> \r\n> Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nI found the docs for this here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-container\r\n\r\n> x-ms-blob-public-access\tOptional. Specifies whether data in the container may be accessed publicly and the level of access. Possible values include:\r\n> \r\n> - container: Specifies full public read access for container and blob data. Clients can enumerate blobs within the container via anonymous request, but cannot enumerate containers within the storage account.\r\n> - blob: Specifies public read access for blobs. Blob data within this container can be read via anonymous request, but container data is not available. Clients cannot enumerate blobs within the container via anonymous request.\r\n> \r\n> If this header is not included in the request, container data is private to the account owner.\r\n\r\nAfter reading that I think the proposal to make a `public_access` flag with the string values \"none\", \"container\" and \"blob\" would work very well. It would default to \"none\".  This would then create a command line flag `--azureblob-public-access` as you suggested.\r\n\r\nThis would be very easy to implement with a config flag like this one\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/4b5fe3adad013b5e0bbf107e560968ea94d2772d/backend/crypt/crypt.go#L36-L50\r\n\r\nDo you want to have a go at this? The 3 examples can be azblob.PublicAccessNone, azblob.PublicAccessBlob,  azblob.PublicAccessContainer and the default can be azblob.PublicAccessNone (not sure what this value actually is!)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/781989888/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4351470160,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQzNTE0NzAxNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4351470160","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-19T10:35:48Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.55"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4351920106,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDM1MTkyMDEwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4351920106","actor":{"login":"krmanish","id":4631983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzE5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4631983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish","html_url":"https://github.com/krmanish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-19T12:31:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4351921468,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ0MzUxOTIxNDY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4351921468","actor":{"login":"krmanish","id":4631983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzE5ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4631983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish","html_url":"https://github.com/krmanish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krmanish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-19T12:32:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/782046722","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5045#issuecomment-782046722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone
