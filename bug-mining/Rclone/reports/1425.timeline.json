This is usually the quickest way since listing lots of files is quick (1 API call per 100s of files).\n\nHowever `--no-traverse` stops the destination listing and checks each file in the source with `NewObject` (1 API call per file). This is usually slower unless you are only transferring a few files in which case it can be much quicker.\n\nAnecdotally from the timings above it looks like your use of `--no-traverse` **is** doing a full traverse of the destination protondrive.\n\n> > I wonder if the modtime `--copy-links` isn't working on FreeBSD?\n> \n> How is `--copy-links` relevant? The performance of `rclone copy` using 1.71.1 is the same with or without `--copy-links`.\n\nFine, we'll ignore that.\n\n> > I wonder if somehow that API has slowed down a lot and is returning all the files or something like that.\n> \n> Has the NewObject API changed between rclone 1.69.3 and 1.70.0? Is this REST API on the Proton Drive server or code linked to the rclone client?\n\nThere are no changes in the protondrive backend in from 1.69.0 to 1.70.0\n\nHowever there was a major change in the listing architecture to implement `--list-cutoff`\n\n- 385465bfa sync: implement --list-cutoff to allow on disk sorting for reduced memory use\n- 0f7ecf6f0 list: add ListDirSortedFn for callback oriented directory listing\n- 08e81f842 list: Implement Sorter to sort directory entries\n- 37120ef7b list: add WithListP helper to implement List for ListP backends\n- cba653d50 walk: move NewListRHelper into list.Helper to avoid circular dependency\n- bff229713 accounting: Add listed stat for number of directory entries listed\n- 117f583eb walk: factor Listing helpers into their own file and add tests\n- 656e789c5 fs/list: tweak directory listing assertions after allowing // names\n \n> > You could try investigating with `-vv --dump responses` and see if that gives you any ideas.\n> \n> Command\n> \n> ```\n> /mnt/zdd/home/derek/bin/rclone-v1.69.3-freebsd-amd64/rclone copy --checkers=12 --copy-links --max-age=1h --metadata --no-traverse --protondrive-replace-existing-draft=true --verbose=3 --dump headers,bodies,requests,responses /mnt/zdd/share/Archive/Documents proton:Archive/Documents\n> ```\n> \n> didn't print any HTTP request or response headers or bodies. Did I specify the `--dump` option correctly?\n\nYou did it correctly, unfortunately the protondrive doesn't use the rclone HTTP Transport like it should so that does not work :-(\n\n> Note that I observed similar performance of `rclone copy --max-age=1h --no-traverse` using 1.69.3 (fast) and 1.71.1 (slow) on an Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 virtual machine running on Proxmox 9.0.10. Without `--no-traverse`, rclone 1.69.3 takes much longer to complete the copy, so my guess is that `--no-traverse` is misbehaving for Proton Drive in rclone versions after 1.69.3.\n\n\n> I ran the same copy command using 1.69.3 and 1.71.2 in FreeBSD 13.3 using a local file system destination and noticed no difference in performance, so this issue seems to be particular to at least the Proton Drive remote.\n\nWhat we need to do for the next step is to see whether my hypothesis is correct - that somehow `--no-traverse` is being ignored and a full destination directory scan is happening, or whether something else is going on.\n\nHere is a version of rclone which will debug all the List, NewObject and protondrive API calls. Can you do a failing test with this using DEBUG log `-vv` and send me the full log file please. You can either post it here (clean any personal data from it first) or email it to me nick@craig-wood.com with a link to this issue.\n\n[v1.72.0-beta.9188.3034ecf33.fix-8860-protondrive-no-traverse](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-8860-protondrive-no-traverse/v1.72.0-beta.9188.3034ecf33.fix-8860-protondrive-no-traverse/) on branch [fix-8860-protondrive-no-traverse](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/tree/fix-8860-protondrive-no-traverse) (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\n\nThank you","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3425776246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3429789215","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8860#issuecomment-3429789215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8860","id":3429789215,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M7Mbm4f","user":{"login":"derekmahar","id":6047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar","html_url":"https://github.com/derekmahar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekmahar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-21T22:25:36Z","updated_at":"2025-10-22T05:59:11Z","body":"@ncw, I emailed you a log file for an \"rclone copy\" operation of a different set of files than my documents because some of my document file names contain private information.\n\nDespite not transferring a single file, the copy operation using rclone 1.72.0-beta took almost five hours to complete!

\n> Despite not transferring a single file, the copy operation using rclone 1.72.0-beta took almost five hours to complete! Using rclone 1.69.3, this operation completed in just 2.8 s.\n\nThat was really useful - thank you.\n\nNewObject is called 6397 times but as you said if no objects are transferred then it shouldn't be called at all.\n\nThe file names for every single call of NewObject look like directory names not file names which is a big clue.\n\nAnd all the returns are \"object not found\" which isn't surprising since `NewObject` finds objects (files) not directories.\n\nWith that I managed to replicate and track down the problem :-) Please give this a
