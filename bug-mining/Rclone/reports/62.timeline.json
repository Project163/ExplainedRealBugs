See [the openstack large objects doc](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_large_objects.html) for more info.\n\nThe [swift library you linked above](https://github.com/ncw/swift) supports all that just fine but rclone would have to do the heavy listing of making the `_segments` container, uploading the chunks etc.\n\nI wasn't aware of the swift tool convention before -

must close #46 \nIt's a quick fix and this is my first experience with Go, so I ask for code review.\n\nFor make it works with large files you must add to your rclone.conf `segment-size = 5368709120` and start rclone operations with param ``--size-only=true`, because md5 hash of manifest file isn't equals md5 of original file.\n\nAlso in sync copy mode rclone removes segments files, I don't know how to fix this logic in app architecture level. May be we need to add some config flag and handle it in operations.go:409 or operations.go:460.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":419911063,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxOTkxMTA2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/419911063","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cc7b9af50ead0ed209afd3e70fd29975180eb8db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/cc7b9af50ead0ed209afd3e70fd29975180eb8db","created_at":"2015-09-26T14:54:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":420111454,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQyMDExMTQ1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/420111454","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-27T09:23:24Z","milestone":{"title":"1.22"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":421056795,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDIxMDU2Nzk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/421056795","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"cc7b9af50ead0ed209afd3e70fd29975180eb8db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/cc7b9af50ead0ed209afd3e70fd29975180eb8db","created_at":"2015-09-28T18:13:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/143832013","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/46#issuecomment-143832013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/46","id":143832013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MzgzMjAxMw==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/
