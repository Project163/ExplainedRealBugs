This can introduce or remove a leading / to the result path, whoch is not a problem for most remotes, but in the sftp and bucket based backeds this changes the effective path.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to not use plain remotes in the config for crypt and cache, like you mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe solution for the crypt remote is quite simple and I will create a PR soon.\r\nThe cache remote is a bit harder, because it uses the combined path as a local path to store the chunks. This means there needs to be a difference between path including a leading / and without.\r\n\r\n@ncw Do you know a good way to differentiate between the two cases on a local remote (the cache temp
