You also can't move them back to \"Backed up files\" once done.\r\n\r\nAs I now want to use rclone instead, and rclone for some reason doesn't have that section available under mount points, I'd end up uploading everything again and then have duplicates as rclone doesn't checksum against the files already there under \"Backed up files\".\r\nThat's just not very feasible with large backups.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nAdd \"Backed up files\" to the mount point selection in rclone config for Jottacloud remotes.\r\nAlso adding the ability to add devices (computer name) would probably solve the bug about not being to able to use rclone from two rclone sessions at the same time since they would have separate device names.\r\n\r\nJottaclouds own command line client has both these features but unfortunately it really blows in every other way.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3069/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
