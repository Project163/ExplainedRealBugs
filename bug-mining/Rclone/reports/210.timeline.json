would like to propose a optional \"cache on copy\" when using mounts and copying(or cat'ing). \n\ni.e. Designate a temp directory and when a copy (or stream/seek/cat) occurs cache the file at full (or bandwidth throttled) speed to the temp directory and keep serving the requests for a period of time from that location. Trying to eliminate intermittent problems from the streaming client.\n\nCaching the uploads would allow the size of it to be known in advance and retries to be done which would make it much more reliable. Caching uploads and downloads would make them both seekable. \n\nThe idea here is for applications that would use rclone mounts, you'd want to cache as much data as possible to the temp directory and serve that data to the client when requested.  You'd want to cache _ahead_ of the client as much as possible so that each 'seek' of the client is directed at the local cached copy.\n\nThis would require some ability to manage the size of the cache.  This could be done either by time or by 'pressure' on the cache.  i.e. define a max size and when the temp area feels pressure, it would free the oldest items if they were not actively in use.  If there was nothing to free, it would simply not cache and warn the user of the temp size may not be adequate.  We should also consider a configurable max time an item could remain in the cache to prevent very old files from being served to the client.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/711/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":17,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/246020631","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/707#issuecomment-246020631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/707","id":246020631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjAyMDYzMQ==","user":{"login":"calisro","id":5018276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTgyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5018276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro","html_url":"https://github.com/calisro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-09T19:50:48Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T19:54:26Z","body":"I would think no matter what we'd need seeking on the http stream.
