We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.53.3\r\n- os/arch: linux/arm64\r\n- go version: go1.15.5\r\n\r\nrclone v1.53.3\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15.5\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nAttempting to backup remote FTP sites to local folders sometimes fails with connections being refused by the remote FTP server. As the error occurs randomly in each pass this renders the backup totally unreliable as there is no way to know if a site has been completely copied or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nHi!\r\nI believe having a switch to force a delay between files could make the process less \"aggressive\" against the remote ftp server and prevent the issue from happening.\r\nAs suggested in the forum enabling the \"--tpslimit \" for FTP connections could be the way to go.\r\n\r\nThread;\r\n[https://forum.rclone.org/t/forcing-pauses-between-files/](url)\r\n\r\nPastebin reference log\r\n[https://pastebin.com/HhnTZMdC](url)\r\n\r\nPlease note that while this log does end with success at the third attempt other remote FTPs with larger amounts of small files are always failing for me regardless of any passes, checkers and transfers combinations I try. \r\n\r\nThank you for rclone and any extra time you put into this issue!","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4906/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
