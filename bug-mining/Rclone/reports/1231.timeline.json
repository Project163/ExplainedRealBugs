this is likely when resync is run when data is already present vs copying the data itself.. There are no changes made to files when moving between a --resync and normal run.  \r\n\r\ndefaults:\r\n\tresync: 10m47.0s\r\n\tnormal: 6m44.7s\r\n\r\ndefaults with ignore checksum: (--ignore-listing-checksum --ignore-checksum)\r\n\tresync: 10m36.5s\r\n\tnormal: 6m31.9s\r\n\r\n### overview\r\n\r\nSo as you can see bisync is orders of magnitude slower than `copy` or `sync` . `ls` is incredibly fast as is `sync` and `copy` in both directions (e.g. uses up almost 100% of bandwidth)\r\n\r\nI only ran the test of `lsl` and `ls` at the very end and now thinking that bisync relies on lsl as this so incredibly slow (as I believe bisync does not use checksum so would need `lsl` info to compare?).\r\n\r\nI can do a local to crypt (local) bisync in 15s (--resync) and 8.7s for subsequent. \r\n\r\nIs there something I am doing wrong? If not, are there plans/options available to rclone to improve the speed of bisync so that it is more in line with 2 x sync/copy commands (e.g. one upload, one download) or is this a limitation that is unlikely to be overcome? Also, if this is due to lsl taking so long is there a way to speed up lsl? \r\n\r\nThanks to you all for your hard work and a special thank you @nielash for all you've been doing on bisync and continue to do. I as many others massively appreciate it and when this tool is out of experimental stages it will be a game changer for so many. If I had any free time or money right now I would help out but unfortunately the best I can do is give you some benchmarks and user feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks

https://github.com/cjnaz/rclonesync-V2/issues/66 (eric-void) -> (cjnaz)\r\n\r\n> looking at the code there is a lot of work to copy Path2 files not in Path1, and then do an \"rclone sync\" from Path1 to Path2. Why don't you just do and \"rclone copy\" from Path1 to Path2, and then an \"rclone copy\" from Path2 to Path1?\r\n> This is much simpler, there is no need to read 2 times LSL files and to loop for missing Path2 files, and the result should be the same. Am i missing something?\r\n\r\nThe first-sync optimization is deferred for now since its not broke and should be rarely run.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#discussion_r688913159 (ncw)\r\n\r\nSo `--resync` is asymetrical?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better implemented by the equivalent of\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone copy --update Path1 Path2\r\nrclone copy --update Path2 Path1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
