I forgot about this ticket when I was doing it though.\n\nWhat I could do instead is implement this ticket and make sure 400 errors, 504 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT and 408 GATEWAY TIMEOUT return errors that shouldn't be retried from amazon cloud drive.\n\nThe one possible downside is the eventual consistency of amazon directory listings - when you upload something it doesn't always appear in the directory listing for a while (seconds usually), so if you uploaded a file, got this sort of error, then immediately restarted the sync then it would upload it again and get a different error at the end.\n\nThe fix I posted in #606 only deals with the TIMEOUT errors and not \"400 Bad request\", so probably what is required is a combination of these two fixes.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/238010061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":747377486,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDc0NzM3NzQ4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/747377486","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-06T07:09:33Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.33"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-06T07:13:05Z","updated_at":"2016-08-06T07:13:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/601","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/601/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/601/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/601/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/601","id":168503668,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNjg1MDM2Njg=","number":601,"title":"Uploads

rclone 1.32 on Windows Server 2012 R2\nConnecting to Amazon Cloud Drive\nCommand used:`rclone sync I:\\MOVIES ACD:SERVERNAME\\MOVIES --bwlimit 24M --max-size=50G --transfers=6 --exclude \".*/\"`\n\nFor the past ten days to two weeks, many of my uploads to Amazon hit 99% and then restart at 0%. When I run the command with the verbose command, I regularly see one of the following error messages (in order of frequency):\n\n`error Post https://content-na.drive.amazonaws.com/cdproxy/nodes?suppress=deduplication: write tcp 192.168.2.99:52277->xx.xxx.xxx.xxx:443: wsasend: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host`\n\n`Received error: HTTP code 504: \"504 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT\", no response body` `- low level retry`\n(these low level retries sometimes get up to four or five before finally succeeding)\n\n`Received error: HTTP code 500: \"500 Internal Server Error\", reponse body: {\"message\":\"Internal failure\"}\n`\n\nIs there something happening on Amazon's end? I upped the transfer number to six in the hopes that more attempts would lead to more successful uploads and it seems to be working, but I am still seeing regular resets.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/238064020","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/559#issuecomment-238064020","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/559","id":238064020,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODA2NDAyMA==","user":{"login":"zstadler","id":1304610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQ2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1304610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler","html_url":"https://github.com/zstadler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstadler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-07T05:08:57Z","updated_at":"2016-08-07T05:08:57Z","body":"I suppose the directory listing delay issue can impact many scenarios, not only when the upload was interrupted and resumed.

most part. I've been able to upload about 7.5 TB in the last week and have not had many errors (perhaps 3% of files uploading would fail). \n\nHowever, I've killed rclone syncs at various times over the last week for various reasons. However, now it appears all the files (they're starting to be the larger files as well) are beginning to not only transfer, but also receive the 504 error. Every now and again one of the files transfers without error, but I nearly will have a 1 to 1 match of files transferred to errors. All the errors are the `504 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT` errors.\n\nIs there something that is causing this or that I can do to avert this?
