Unix convention is to exit with a non-zero status code. Often it's `128 + int(signum)`, but at least not zero. Wikipedia writes ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#Shell_and_scripts)):\r\n\r\n> When a command is terminated by a signal whose number is N, a shell sets the variable $? to a value greater than 128. Most shells use 128+N, while ksh93 uses 256+N.\r\n\r\nThe non-zero exit status enables scripts to handle commands aborted by signals, e.g. by the user. The responsible code is in `atexit.go:Run` where the exit status is hardcoded: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/e635f4c0be24cdf2272b2c6018939e8469e4c6d5/lib/atexit/atexit.go#L54\r\n\r\nI'll be happy to submit a pull request. Would the rclone developers prefer to always use status 2 (\"error not otherwise categorised\") or the 128+signum convention?\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone --version\r\nrclone v1.55.1\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.16.3\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
