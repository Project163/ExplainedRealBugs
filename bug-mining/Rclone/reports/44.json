a lot of the remotes implement a server side copy\n\nTo take advantage of this\n- Implement an optional `Copier` interface\n- Use this to copy individual files if possible\n\nThis will mean you can do `rclone copy drive:a drive:b` and it won't need to download everything and upload it again.\n\nFS support for `Copier`\n- drive supports [copy](https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/files/copy) or could do this by patching the parents list...\n- s3 [supports copy](http://godoc.org/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3#S3.CopyObject)\n- swift [supports copy](https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ObjectCopy)\n- dropbox [supports copy](https://godoc.org/github.com/stacktic/dropbox#Dropbox.Copy)\n- gcs [supports copy](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/storage/v1#ObjectsService.Copy)\n- local doesn't support copy\n\nSee
