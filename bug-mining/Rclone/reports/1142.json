The value is indeed the `sha1sum` of the file.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to implement a new `vendor = fastmail` with support for this kind of SHA1 hash, so that syncing can use the SHA1 instead of relying on mtime. I cannot find any documentation about this property, so I assume it's specific to FastMail's server (\"ME\" might be \"Messaging Engine\", another name that FastMail uses for its domains etc). So `vendor = fastmail` should be appropriate.\r\n\r\nFastMail also supports the `x-oc-mtime` header and uses it to set the mtime. The `PUT` response contains a `x-oc-mtime: accepted` header if the request set it. So the `useOCMtime` quirk should be set to `true` for it.\r\n\r\nFastMail does *not* support the `oc-checksum` header in either of the two ways that [this comment](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/e405ca7733b19b9430afc344324eee3b608c1466/backend/webdav/webdav.go#L1323-L1325) talks about. Specifically, the response contains the `ME:sha1hex` prop regardless of whether the client sends the header or not (ie it doesn't have the NextCloud behavior of using the client-provided value), and the server accepts the `PUT` request even if the client sends an incorrect hash (ie it doesn't have the OwnCloud behavior of using the client-provided value to validate the request body).\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
