We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n1.59.1\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have a \"force resync clean\" feature, meaning that the source is compared to 100% on destination (remote) and anything not present on the remote is added and anything present on the remote that should not be is deleted.\r\n\r\nI appreciate this is what sync should be, but in some sporadic cases I've found where this is not (at least \"old\" stuff left in remote (never have tracked down the \"why\" as it is noticed long after the event). Thus an occasional \"clean\", even of very large datastores would be nice.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nI presume a slight extension to the sync behaviour, possible an extra flag or something, but I would not suggest how it may be achieved. Especially if regular sync should be picking this up.\r\n\r\nIf there is such a problem, whether a compare could be easily made (compare remote to source) and delete/flag to delete could be one way.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
