:-)\r\n\r\nSo you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that!\r\nYou'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nProbably the latest beta (or stable) release has your feature, so try to update your rclone.\r\nThe update instructions are available at https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/\r\n\r\nIf it still isn't there, here is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Search the old issues for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/dropbox-too-many-requests-or-write-operations-trying-again-in-15-seconds/23316/33\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n1.55.0\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nWhile testing bisync with Dropbox I came across request limit issues. In attempt to fix them I followed https://tip.rclone.org/dropbox/#get-your-own-dropbox-app-id\r\nThe instructions is okay but incomplete. I had to make few extra moves to make things work.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\n1. Explicitly state what rclone.conf options correspond to `App key` (client_id) and `App secret` (client_secret)\r\n2. Explicitly state what Dropbox permissions should user provide to rclone (including new ones for `rclone about`, see [oauth2 config in ncw's fix](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/a7333844e2c6163028873cd61197f7c9173e3649#diff-7070c850317ae70144b7c0544c568a183ab48d05f0210e96160c3ecf3746ff22R97)):\r\n- \"files.metadata.write\",\r\n- \"files.content.write\",\r\n- \"files.content.read\",\r\n- \"sharing.write\",\r\n- \"account_info.read\" (`rclone about` will fail without it)\r\n\r\nNote: `rclone about` also needs https://github.com/rclone/rclone/commit/a7333844e2c6163028873cd61197f7c9173e3649 merged on master.","closed_by":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5242/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
