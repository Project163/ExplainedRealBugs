Some of the photos have modification dates before 1/1/1970. \r\nThese end up on pCloud with their mtime set to the current date/time. Judging from the pCloud API docs (https://docs.pcloud.com/methods/file/uploadfile.html), the API only allows Unix timestamps to be set, so I understand why this happens.\r\nHowever, the pCloud App (on macOS in my case) is able to upload those files correctly. Obviously, they are using another API or something. Maybe it has something to do with using time.Time in api/types.go? I would be willing to help but unfortunately, I have no experience with go.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.57.0\r\n- os/version: unknown\r\n- os/kernel: 4.4.180+ (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.17.2\r\n- go/linking: static\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nSynology DS920+, uname -a prints\r\n```\r\nLinux Uther 4.4.180+ #42218 SMP Fri Sep 24 02:41:48 CST 2021 x86_64 GNU/Linux synology_geminilake_920+\r\n```\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
