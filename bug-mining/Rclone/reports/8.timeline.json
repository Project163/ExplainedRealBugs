I'll have a go at using that.\n\n```\nThis is a Go library for detecting the user's home directory without the use of cgo, so the library can be used in cross-compilation environments.\n\nUsage is incredibly simple, just call homedir.Dir() to get the home directory for a user, and homedir.Expand() to expand the ~ in a path to the home directory.\n\nWhy not just use os/user? The built-in os/user package requires cgo on Darwin systems. This means that any Go code that uses that package cannot cross compile. But 99% of the time the use for os/user is just to retrieve the home directory, which we can do for the current user without cgo. This library does that, enabling cross-compilation.\n```\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/66642148/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/66642560","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/15#issuecomment-66642560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/15","id":66642560,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NjQyNTYw","user":{"login":"GoGasUK","id":10152970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTUyOTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10152970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK","html_url":"https://github.com/GoGasUK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GoGasUK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-11T16:13:17Z","updated_at":"2014-12-11T16:13:17Z","body":"Great
