{#operations-hashsum}\r\n\r\nProduces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash\r\nnamed.  The output is in the same format as the standard\r\nmd5sum/sha1sum tool.\r\n\r\nThis takes the following parameters:\r\n\r\n- fs - a remote name string e.g. \"drive:\" for the source, \"/\" for local filesystem\r\n- hashType - type of hash to be used\r\n- download - check by downloading rather than with hash (boolean)\r\n- base64 - output the hashes in base64 rather than hex (boolean)\r\n\r\nIf you supply the download flag, it will download the data from the\r\nremote and create the hash on the fly. This can be useful for remotes\r\nthat don't support the given hash or if you really want to check all\r\nthe data.\r\n\r\nNote that if you wish to supply a checkfile to check hashes against\r\nthe current files then you should use operations/check instead of\r\noperations/hashsum.\r\n\r\nReturns:\r\n\r\n- hashsum - array of strings of the hashes\r\n- hashType - type of hash used\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    $ rclone rc --loopback operations/hashsum fs=bin hashType=MD5 download=true base64=true\r\n    {\r\n        \"hashType\": \"md5\",\r\n        \"hashsum\": [\r\n            \"WTSVLpuiXyJO_kGzJerRLg==  backend-versions.sh\",\r\n            \"v1b_OlWCJO9LtNq3EIKkNQ==  bisect-go-rclone.sh\",\r\n            \"VHbmHzHh4taXzgag8BAIKQ==  bisect-rclone.sh\",\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSee the [hashsum](/commands/rclone_hashsum/) command for more information on the above.\r\n\r\n**Authentication is required for this call.**\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1895657495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1896324560","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7569#issuecomment-1896324560","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7569","id":1896324560,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5xB53Q","user":{"login":"Jwink3101","id":3073584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzM1ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3073584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101","html_url":"https://github.com/Jwink3101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jwink3101/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-17T18:02:51Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T18:47:12Z","body":"This does not allow for requesting a single file.
