What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`) **1.33**\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit) **Linux 64 bit**\n> Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive) **S3**\n> The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`) \n> **#!/bin/bash\n> $(rclone --config /root/scripts/rclone/rclone.conf sync /home/backups/\"$1\" S3Crypt:\"$1\" > /var/log/backups/\"$1\".log 2>&1)**\n\nI am syncing files to AWS S3 via the above script. When I run that command manually i.e. \n\n**rclone --config /root/scripts/rclone/rclone.conf sync /home/backups/\"$1\" S3Crypt:\"$1\" > /var/log/backups/\"$1\".log 2>&1**\n- It works fine. However adding it to a script and executing it (with the same user and permissions) returns the following in the log file. The actual sync worked fine and the files are in S3. What does this mean? \n\n```\n2016/09/28 01:17:57 Couldn't find home directory or read HOME environment variable.\n2016/09/28 01:17:57 Defaulting to storing config in current directory.\n2016/09/28 01:17:57 Use -config flag to workaround.\n2016/09/28 01:17:57 Error was: user: Current not implemented on linux/amd64\n```\n\nI have already set the --config flag as above. And if the config flag was not set it would not have found my bucket to sync to and in the directory I execute from doesn't have a rclone.conf. So it must be using --config. \n\nI dont think this is a problem as far as the syncing is concerned as I can see the latest files in S3...\nShould I ignore this or any workaround? \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"tcf909","id":1562915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjI5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1562915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909","html_url":"https://github.com/tcf909","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T21:16:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T21:16:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1024","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1024/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1024/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1024/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1024","id":200209579,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDAyMDk1Nzk=","number":1024,"title":"rclone mount crypt on acd cp error","user":{"login":"tcf909","id":1562915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjI5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1562915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909","html_url":"https://github.com/tcf909","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcf909/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-01-11T21:16:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T21:51:01Z","closed_at":"2018-09-11T21:51:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":17803236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzgwMzIzNg==","name":"rclone","full_name":"rclone/rclone","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rclone","id":24937341,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0OTM3MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24937341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclone/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone","description":"\"rsync for cloud storage\" -

I started setting up a new server with ubuntu 16.04. and setup rClone, but from this server it is impossible to stream cause the stream is wholte time freezing. I think it is not a hardware problem cause those are dedicated 4 and 8 core servers, i think it is a big cache problem with mounting. \r\n\r\n#1 Informations the main linux system: (all working

the forum thread [Extracting to ACD mount possible?](https://forum.rclone.org/t/extracting-to-acd-mount-possible/4161) I'm now creating this issue.\r\n\r\nI found a race condition involving multiple open `*vfs.RWFileHandle`'s for one file.\r\n\r\nThis is a log containing a failed upload: [rclone_extract_ptr_empty.log](https://gist.github.com/B4dM4n/2aecfd06a48d2099df768ec46af69889#file-rclone_extract_ptr_empty-log). The state after this log is the following:\r\n- Test/JD/rand4/rand.bin size=0 mtime=2018-01-29 21:25:18.826 +0100 (mtime of the source)\r\n- Test/JD/rand4/rand.bin size=0 mtime=2018-01-30 14:46:04.??? +0100 (mtime of upload time)\r\n\r\nI assume the problem is `*vfs.RWFileHandle.close()` not being synchronized between multiple files.\r\nThe log file above shows two `close()` executing in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe first `RWFileHandle` belongs to a new empty file. The second one the handle being written to. During the `close()` of the first handle, the empty cache file gets `Move`'ed to the backend. After the move is completed the cache file get's deleted.\r\nWhen the second `close()` tries to move the cache file, which is already gone.\r\n\r\nThis could also be related to #1181.\r\n\r\nI think, `close()` should check whether there is another `RWFileHandle` opened for it's file. Hopefully this fixes the race condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.39-096-gcf6d522d\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux 4.14.13-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Jan 10 11:14:50 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using?
