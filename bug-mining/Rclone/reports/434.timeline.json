It returns 404, so NewObject returns nil, err.\r\n3. `pairChecker` calls `operations.Move` with nil dst.\r\n4. `googlecloudstorage.Fs` doesn't implement `Move`, so `operations.Move` calls `operations.Copy`, which calls `googlecloudstorage.Fs.Copy`.\r\n5. `googlecloudstorage.Fs.Copy` calls `googlecloudstorage.Fs.Mkdir`, which calls `f.svc.Buckets.Get`. This causes the `GET /storage/v1/b/BUCKET?alt=json` call, which ultimately returns 403.\r\n6. `Mkdir` fails, so `Copy` fails.\r\n\r\nThe obvious fix would be for `Copy` to ignore 403 errors from `Mkdir`. In my case, that should fix things since the bucket does indeed exist and is accessible, but if the bucket isn't accessible it could cause confusion later with some kind of permission error when creating objects.\r\n\r\nThat said, I imagine such a fallback must already exist in the main upload path, since my normal uploads worked fine without `storage.buckets.get`.\r\n\r\nI had a similar issue with restic, and implemented ignore of bucket.get 403 errors there: https://github.com/restic/restic/pull/1281\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nHere's what I believe are all of the relative parts of the log
