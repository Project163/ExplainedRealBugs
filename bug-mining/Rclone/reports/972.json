What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\n1.54.0\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nI cannot easily remember rclone hash names. Compare: `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `MailruHash`, etc. I would like to write them simply as `md5`, `sha1`, `mailru` and so on. For example `rclone hash sha1 remote:file`.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nIntroduce canonical hash name in rclone and a function that modifies a provided name:\r\n- remove dashes\r\n- convert to lowercase\r\n- remove trailing `hash`, if any\r\n\r\nCanonicalization should happen when\r\n- a hash algorithm is internally registered\r\n- one of hash commands is parsed\r\n- in `rc` protocol handler\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- what name should appear in documentation? needs thinking\r\n- there are official hash names out there that contain a dash like `sha256-something`, but none of them are used in rclone a.t.m.","closed_by":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5071/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
