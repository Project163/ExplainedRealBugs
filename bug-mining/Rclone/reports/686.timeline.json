As of lately they have changed pricing on unlimited storage to $10/mo/user. We'd wondered if Citrix would ever make a Linux tool that we could use to sync our encrypted backups—so I called them. They said that they will \"most likely never make one\" as they are more focused on the Windows tools and products they offer. We have tested everything they support (eg. their windows sync tool and drive mapper, ftp, ftps, webdav, and their SF API v3).\r\n\r\nI'd like to note that our account file max size limit is set to 100GB files (for some it's 10GB but you can get this changed by contacting them). All accounts come with unlimited API hits.\r\n\r\nAfter testing all of these ways we've learned a lot about limitations and complications. Using certain services, files disappear after upload and takes a while before it shows up. Everything is middle-ware/proxy and loses data on uploaded files.\r\n\r\nHere are a few results of what we found most successful:\r\n- QNAP App (max 10GB files) https://appcenter.qnap.com/eng/qpkg/overview/HybridBackup\r\n- FTP/FTPS (max ??GB files) https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX207859\r\n- WebDAV (max 2GB files) https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX207863\r\n- Citrix SF v3 API (max size set by account limitation 10GB or 100GB files)\r\nhttps://api.sharefile.com/rest/index/start.aspx\r\n- Web App (https://yourname.sharefile.com) uses the API \r\n(max size set by account limitation 10GB or 100GB files)\r\n\r\nOn top of all this, you have 18 hours to finish each file upload before it times out and disappears (through any of these services).\r\n\r\nOur tests have shown that FTP is the worst. Any file size would fail randomly and/or not show up in your account. Download works great, though.\r\n\r\nWebDAV is really slow to connect to, but seems to work OK with files under 2GB. We tested this with rclone and all files would upload twice as the first one couldn't get confirmed in time because it takes a bit before the file shows up in your account. The larger the file, the longer it takes before it can be confirmed in your account.\r\n\r\nThis is where we dropped all services and focused on the direct SF API they provide (see the ShareFile REST URL above). We created a Windows CLI tool (using https://github.com/citrix/ShareFile-NET) to upload files manually through this API—and this worked greatly! We tried small, medium, and large files—all the way up to 100GB. All files were delivered directly into the account and could be confirmed. Therefore, the API supports the largest file uploads at greatest speeds while avoiding their midway proxy.\r\n\r\nAfter this successful test, @D3lta made a Linux tool using NodeJS and these have the same results as the Windows CLI tool above, hooray! However, this would require a lot of additional development for it to become a functional sync tool.\r\n\r\nWith all of this being said, we'd **LOVE** to see rclone become integrated with Citrix ShareFile's SF v3
