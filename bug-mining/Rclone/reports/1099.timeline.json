A relative path is made absolute first, and this process implicitly performs clean (resolve) and would work in your case as well.

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nIn existing version, relative paths are made absolute with `filepath.Abs`, which implicitely performs a `filepath.Clean` which eliminates path elements such as `..`. But paths that are already absolute are not cleaned, which means a path element `..` will be kept and encoded according to backend encoding.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a call to `filepath.Clean` for absolute paths, making it more consistent.\r\n\r\nWindows paths with prefix `\\\\` are excluded from this, they were already excluded from `filepath.Abs` in existing version, as UNC paths cannot be relative (this is documented) nor contain \"relative\" path elements (undocumented, but at least the `dir` command such as `dir \\\\?\\C:\\Some\\Path\\..\\OtherPath` errors with \"The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect\", and also, in any case, this means using `\\\\?` prefix can be used as workaround in case the Clean/Abs leads to problems).\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed
