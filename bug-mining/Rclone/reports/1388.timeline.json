However, we need to carefully assess the impact of a downgrade on other features and dependencies to ensure it doesn't introduce new regressions or break existing functionality.\n\n2.  **Wait for an upstream patch:** The AWS SDK team is aware of the issue (as it's an open bug on their GitHub). We could wait for them to release a fix that allows for the proper disabling of integrity checks in multipart uploads.\n\n3.  **Implement our own multipart uploader:** This would involve writing a custom multipart upload logic in Pipak, bypassing the `aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/s3/manager` package. While this gives us full control over the process and can immediately resolve the current problem, it's the most effort-intensive option and would require maintaining this custom implementation moving forward.\n\nI lean towards exploring the first option (downgrading `aws-sdk-go-v2`) first due to its potential ease of implementation.\n\n@ncw -

I've added a fix to the v1.70-stable branch **only** with this in. This means it should be fixed for v1.70.x where x >= 2. We'll need to fix it properly before the v1.71 release though!\n\nThanks.

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a significant rewrite of the PikPak's upload, specifically targeting the direct handling of file uploads rather than relying on the generic S3 manager. The primary motivation for this rewrite is to address critical upload failures reported in #8629.\r\n\r\nKey changes include:\r\n\r\n* Added a new `multipart.go` file that implements multipart uploads using the AWS S3 SDK.\r\n* Removed the dependency on the AWS S3 manager package and replaced it with custom multipart upload handling.\r\n* Updated the PikPak test package to include tests for the new multipart upload functionality, including configurable chunk size and upload cutoff.\r\n* Added new configuration options `upload_cutoff` to control when to switch to chunked uploads.\r\n* Defined constraints for `chunk_size` and `upload_cutoff`, including minimum and maximum values, with validation logic.\r\n* Adjusted default value for `upload_concurrency` from 5 to 4.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution

looked into why the `TestServerSideCopyOverSelf` integration test failed, and it turns out PikPak creates duplicate files with suffixes like `(1)` or `(2)` when we copy an object into a directory where a file with the same name already exists.\n\nBecause of this, our system retrieves the metadata of the existing object instead of the newly copied one, leading to corruption.\n\nThis brings up a question: Should the backend's `Copy()` function be called if the target file already exists?
