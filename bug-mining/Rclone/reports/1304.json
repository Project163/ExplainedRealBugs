There must be a bug in the option parsing logic which affects any options that accept multiple values. I think one of the related commits is 3280b6b83c778419e0d682313d4b8015cb790ea9, but there should be more.\r\n\r\nI confirm that `RCLONE_` prefixed environment variables work correctly in v1.67.0 and before.\r\n\r\n### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.68.0\r\n- os/version: ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit)\r\n- os/kernel: 5.15.146.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 (x86_64)\r\n- os/type: linux\r\n- os/arch: amd64\r\n- go/version: go1.23.1\r\n- go/linking: dynamic\r\n- go/tags: none\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The command you were trying to run\r\n\r\nSet the value of environment variable `RCLONE_INCLUDE_FROM` to `/path/to/file`, and run just `rclone version -vv`.\r\n\r\n### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024/09/11 02:24:37 DEBUG : Setting  include_from=\"/path/to/file\" from environment variable RCLONE_INCLUDE_FROM\r\n2024/09/11 02:24:37 CRITICAL: Failed to load \"filter\" default values: failed to initialise \"filter\" options: couldn't parse config item \"include_from\" = \"/path/to/file\" as []string: parsing \"/path/to/file\" as []string failed: invalid character '/' looking for beginning of value\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
