This means that this is happening\n- you upload file with rclone - db is correct\n- desktop client uploads a change to the file - db is now out of date\n- you download the file with rclone - db is out of date - rclone complains about corrupt MD5SUMs\n\nSo I think this is expected behaviour (if not very helpful).\n\nPossible solutions\n- A work-around would be to make sure rclone syncs to a different directory to the desktop client.\n- Alternatively I could add a flag to rclone to tell it to ignore the MD5SUMs and download stuff anyway.\n- Or radically stop storing MD5SUMs and mtimes in the datastore.  I might have to do this anyway as dropbox are dropping support for datastores.\n\nAt minimum I need to add stuff to the dropbox docs explaining the situation!\n\nAny further ideas?\n\nThanks\n\nNick\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/109419902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":323928450,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyMzkyODQ1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/323928450","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-05T19:49:54Z","label":{"name":"doc fix","color":"eb6420"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/109448195","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/75#issuecomment-109448195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/75","id":109448195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwOTQ0ODE5NQ==","user":{"login":"darren12345","id":12751052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzUxMDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12751052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345","html_url":"https://github.com/darren12345","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darren12345/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-05T21:45:49Z","updated_at":"2015-06-05T21:45:49Z","body":"I noticed there were no hashes stored on the Dropbox side for files that didn't come from rclone. \n\nI don't suppose there's a way of forcing rclone to generate a hash on a file that is stored in Dropbox without downloading it first?\n\nBut yes, the deprecation of the datastore API is an embuggerance and it seems almost not worth fixing this problem because of it anyway.
