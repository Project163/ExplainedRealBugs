I'd control this with an additional flag - `--track-renames` say.\n\nIf this flag was set, in [run()](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/fs/sync.go#L415) I'd make sure both source and destination were traversed first (like the deleteBefore option).  Once traversed I'd do a separate phase doing the renames, adjusting the destination map on successful rename, then carry on doing the sync as usual.  This would need a unit test or two as I try to keep the core syncing routines fully covered.\n\nNot the easiest first project, but it is of relatively narrow scope so not too bad.\n\nNote: not all the remotes can do a server side rename (or a server side copy + delete) so you probably would want to ignore this option on those remotes as the move primitive would download and upload the file which would be less efficient than just uploading the new one. \n\nIf you want to spend a bit of time studying go then [the go tour](https://tour.golang.org) is an excellent place to

that would be great!\r\n\r\nThis will involve adjusting fs/sync.go which is quite intricate, but it is fully tested.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd do is make sure that the source map and dest map get loaded into memory in the `run` method (which will make it incompatible with `--no-traverse` - you want to follow the `--delete-before` code path).  When both maps are loaded then do the rename detection in a separate pass, removing things from the src and dst map when you do a successful rename.  Then fall through into the sync/copy/move proper.\r\n\r\nThe actual moves you want to do with the `Move` function.  This will fall back to download/upload if the remote doesn't implement `Move` or `Copy` which isn't ideal so if the remote doesn't support `Move` or `Copy` you probably want to ignore the `--track-rename` flag completely.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/267813619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":897809337,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODk3ODA5MzM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/897809337","actor":{"login":"bep","id":394382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/394382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep","html_url":"https://github.com/bep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-18T10:23:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":897809338,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg5NzgwOTMzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/897809338","actor":{"login":"bep","id":394382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/394382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep","html_url":"https://github.com/bep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-18T10:23:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/267816431","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/888#issuecomment-267816431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/888","id":267816431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzgxNjQzMQ==","user":{"login":"bep","id":394382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/394382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep","html_url":"https://github.com/bep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-18T11:36:47Z","updated_at":"2016-12-18T11:36:47Z","body":"Thanks
