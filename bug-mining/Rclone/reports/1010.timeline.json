was specified in config file.\r\n\r\nBased on commit message it seems, that AWS chained auth provider credentials (that were read from file specified in `shared_credentials_file`) was ignored (and value reassigned to `null`) if AccessKeyID and SecretAuthKey wasn't specified (but when you specifies path to file with credentials it's a normal case if you are not passing AccesskeyID and SecretAuthKey directly).\r\n\r\nP.S.

I've introduced lots of bugs in rclone ;-) The AWS auth is very complicated and I'm not sure I understand it well enough!\r\n\r\n> Maybe it worth it to make testcases for all auth flows.\r\n\r\nThat would be lovely. They would have to be integration tests to be meaningful which would require all the different auth methods setup for s3 in advance which sounds like hard work, but it would be great to have done that!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/954689861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5543764503,"node_id":"CE_lADOAQ-n5M4901Q7zwAAAAFKbyIX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5543764503","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"712f9c97607de3ba9990d85d8b19ba884e576c94","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/712f9c97607de3ba9990d85d8b19ba884e576c94","created_at":"2021-10-30T10:55:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5543764510,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M4901Q7zwAAAAFKbyIe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5543764510","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e6e1c49b58a3065aaca70d7189d251e03dbd32ce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/e6e1c49b58a3065aaca70d7189d251e03dbd32ce","created_at":"2021-10-30T10:55:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/955190297","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5762#issuecomment-955190297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5762","id":955190297,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M447wwZ","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-30T10:55:44Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T10:55:44Z","body":"I've
