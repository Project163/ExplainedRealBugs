1:**\r\nI have automation setup that plex will not start unless rclone is started (and if one crashes, the other restarts).  As rclone is needed before plex starts, rclone throws an error saying it cant connect to my plex instance (as per below) cause its not running.\r\n\r\nI do not see any future items in the log file for successful connection to plex.  Does it retry after X time?  If not - can it?\r\n\r\n**Issue 2:**\r\nAdditionally, i am getting a few errors in my log file which im not sure of.
