This function will be called on exit if the service exits\r\n// on a signal.\r\nfunc Notify() func() {\r\n\tvar (\r\n\t\tfinaliseOnce sync.Once\r\n\t\tfnHandle = atexit.Register(finalise)\r\n\t)\r\n\t\r\n\tfinalise := func() {\r\n\t\tatexit.Unregister(fnHandle)\t\t\r\n\t\tfinaliseOnce.Do(func() {\r\n\t\t\t_ = sysdnotify.Stopping()\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Notify ready to systemd\r\n\tif err := sysdnotify.Ready(); err != nil {\r\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"failed to notify ready to systemd: %v\", err)\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\treturn finalise\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen this can be called just before `s.Wait` in \r\n\r\n- cmd/rcd/rcd.go\r\n- cmd/serve/dlna/dlna.go\r\n- cmd/serve/http/http.go\r\n- cmd/serve/restic/restic.go\r\n- cmd/serve/sftp/sftp.go\r\n- cmd/serve/webdav/webdav.go\r\n\r\nLike this\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tdefer systemd.Notify()()\r\n\ts.Wait\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr maybe this if you prefer\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tfinalise := systemd.Notify()\r\n        defer finalise()\r\n\ts.Wait\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt might be that we could use this in `mount` too, but I haven't investigated that.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
