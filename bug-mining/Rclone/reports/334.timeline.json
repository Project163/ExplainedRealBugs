workaround is to install and enable dnsmasq (without dhcp support) and point `/etc/resolv.conf` to it.\r\n\r\nExample `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file:\r\n```\r\nlisten-address=127.0.0.1\r\nbind-interfaces\r\nresolv-file=/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample `/etc/resolv.conf` file:\r\n```\r\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way apps that use glibc and systemd APIs will still use systemd-resolved and apps that use `/etc/resolv.conf` directly (like rclone) will be directed to dnsmasq, which will receive up-to date list of nameservers from systemd-resolved.\r\n\r\nThe only missing feature would probably be the automatic restart of dnsmasq whenever `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf`
