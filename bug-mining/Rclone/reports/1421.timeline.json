i wrote on the forum thread:\n\nrclone legacy login for jottacloud is exactly what Elgiganten cloud/Elkjøp cloud used to login.\n\nElgiganten cloud do have sms authentication and 2FA app authentication, i’m hoping someone can look into this and perhaps change some urls for authenticating (if it’s that easy haha!) and add a dedicated option for logging in to both Elgiganten Cloud and Elkjøp cloud.\n\nOne or 2+ more dedicated cloud logins added to rclone then too! :smiley: Like they did with Telia, Tele sky, Tele2 etc.\n\nI think Elgiganten Cloud /Elkjøp cloud would need 2 different logins because they are in different countries i would imagine there being different authentication urls etc? Don’t know how many versions they have but i use Elgiganten Cloud the “Swedish” one.\n\nI think the Jottacloud legacy option can be removed completely after that or is there anything else that uses it at all?\n\nedit: Once the logins for these 2 clouds are updated one should only need to do a \"rclone config reconnect\" command and select the new login options that has the right login information

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nElkjøp with all its subsidiaries have finally migrated their whitelabel services away from the legacy authentication method, and seem to be using OAuth 2.0 OpenAPI Connect in the same variant as Telia and Tele2 currently does.\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n- Elkjøp Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no)\r\n- Elgiganten Sweden (cloud.elgiganten.se)\r\n- Elgiganten Denmark (cloud.elgiganten.dk)\r\n- Giganti Cloud (cloud.gigantti.fi)\r\n- ELKO Cloud (cloud.elko.is)\r\n\r\nI also added a new whitelabel provider from the company MediaMarkt, called Let's Go Cloud (letsgo.jotta.cloud).\r\n\r\nAdding all of these new alternatives to the config process in the same manner as Tele2 and Telia was implemented, would lead to a lot of clutter, both in code and in the configuration UX, in my opinion. I therefore decided to do some refactoring of the code, and restructuring of the configuration flow. This includes no longer hardcoding two complete URLs, representing the Authorization and Token endpoints, for each of these services. These are very similar for all of the whitelabel services, the domain name is the main difference. But also, I decided to not only centralize the generation of these URLs, but also to use the OpenID provider configuration endpoint to retrieve them. This should be at a well-known URL ending on `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, according to the OpenID standard. We already use such an endpoint for the standard authentication, although there the well-known URL are parsed from the login token.\r\n\r\nThe previous configuration flow included the following part:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOption config_type.\r\nSelect authentication type.\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in an existing string value.\r\nPress Enter for the default (standard).\r\n   / Standard authentication.\r\n 1 | Use this if you're a normal Jottacloud user.\r\n   \\ (standard)\r\n   / Legacy authentication.\r\n 2 | This is only required for certain whitelabel versions of Jottacloud and not recommended for normal users.\r\n   \\ (legacy)\r\n   / Telia Cloud authentication.\r\n 3 | Use this if you are using Telia Cloud.\r\n   \\ (telia)\r\n   / Tele2 Cloud authentication.\r\n 4 | Use this if you are using Tele2 Cloud.\r\n   \\ (tele2)\r\n   / Onlime Cloud authentication.\r\n 5 | Use this if you are using Onlime Cloud.\r\n   \\ (onlime)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has now been replaced by the following, split into 2 steps:\r\n```\r\nOption config_type.\r\nSelect authentication type.\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in an existing value of type string.\r\nPress Enter for the default (standard).\r\n   / Standard authentication.\r\n 1 | Use this if you're a normal Jottacloud user.\r\n   \\ (standard)\r\n   / Whitelabel authentication.\r\n 2 | Use this if you are using the service offered by a third party such as Telia, Tele2, Onlime, Elkjøp, etc.\r\n   \\ (whitelabel)\r\n   / Legacy authentication.\r\n 3 | This is no longer supported by any known services and not recommended for normal users.\r\n   \\ (legacy)\r\nconfig_type> 2\r\n\r\nOption whitelabel_type.\r\nSelect whitelabel type.\r\nChoose a number from below, or type in an existing value of type string.\r\nPress Enter for the default (telia_se).\r\n   / Telia Cloud authentication.\r\n 1 | Use this if you are using Telia Cloud (Sweden).\r\n   \\ (telia_se)\r\n   / Telia Sky authentication.\r\n 2 | Use this if you are using Telia Sky (Norway).\r\n   \\ (telia_no)\r\n   / Tele2 Cloud authentication.\r\n 3 | Use this if you are using Tele2 Cloud.\r\n   \\ (tele2)\r\n   / Onlime Cloud authentication.\r\n 4 | Use this if you are using Onlime Cloud.\r\n   \\ (onlime)\r\n   / Elkjøp Cloud authentication.\r\n 5 | Use this if you are using Elkjøp Cloud (Norway).\r\n   \\ (elkjop)\r\n   / Elgiganten Cloud authentication.\r\n 6 | Use this if you are using Elgiganten Cloud (Sweden).\r\n   \\ (elgiganten_se)\r\n   / Elgiganten Cloud authentication.\r\n 7 | Use this if you are using Elgiganten Cloud (Denmark).\r\n   \\ (elgiganten_dk)\r\n   / Giganti Cloud authentication.\r\n 8 | Use this if you are using Giganti Cloud.\r\n   \\ (gigantti)\r\n   / ELKO Cloud authentication.\r\n 9 | Use this if you are using ELKO Cloud.\r\n   \\ (elko)\r\n   / Let's Go Cloud authentication.\r\n10 | Use this if you are using Let's Go Cloud.\r\n   \\ (letsgo)\r\nwhitelabel_type>\r\n```\r\nThis PR also includes the fix suggested in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8852#issuecomment-3333333963, for the `Reveal failed: input too short when revealing password - is it obscured` bug when using legacy authentication and answering `y` to the question `Do you want to create a machine specific API key?`.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #8852\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/elkjop-cloud-config/52526\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3336058787","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8852#issuecomment-3336058787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8852","id":3336058787,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M7G2Dej","user":{"login":"albertony","id":12441419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQxNDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12441419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony","html_url":"https://github.com/albertony","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertony/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-25T21:53:08Z","updated_at":"2025-09-25T21:53:08Z","body":"I took a stab at this with PR:\n- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/8855\n\nBeta builds will be published here:\n- https://beta.rclone.org/branch/jottacloud-config-fix/\n\nI have tested that standard authentication still works, but have not tested any of the whitelabel authentications.

I can confirm that, from the openid configuration endpoint, that jotta-default is not a supported scope on this service:\n\n```powershell\n(Invoke-RestMethod https://letsgo.jotta.cloud/auth/realms/letsgo/.well-known/openid-configuration).scopes_supported\noffline_access\noffline\nopenid\n```\n\nWhile it is on all the others, which have a larger set of
