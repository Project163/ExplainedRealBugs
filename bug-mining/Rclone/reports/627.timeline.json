Do we think we will get it done by v1.48?\r\n\r\nPossibly!  I'm a bit short of time at the moment though :-(\r\n\r\n> Also if I want to contribute, do you think we can start with support for S3 and then expand to other services or do you think we need to have a generic solution which supports all the providers?\r\n\r\nAll remotes are capable of doing multipart download right now... You can Open an Object with a seek position and a range.\r\n\r\nBecause rclone uses the same interfaces for everything it is the matching upload interface that is the problem, so some help thinking about that would be great!\r\n\r\nWhat I was imagining was a remote would advertise multipart upload capability.  It would need to say something about\r\n- block size range or limits\r\n- min size\r\n\r\nAnd it would need a number of things in the interface\r\n- GetInfo\r\n- Start\r\n- SendBlock\r\n- Finalise\r\n- Abort\r\n\r\nThose would map quite well to the multpart capabilities of remotes.\r\n\r\nThe first one of these to build would be the one for the local backend, but doing one for the S3 backend would be useful too to show that it is possible.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me more about your use case?  Do you want to download single files?  Rclone could have a specialized command for that which would be a lot easier to write.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/484011447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2282152149,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjI4MjE1MjE0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2282152149","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-17T09:34:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2282152150,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyODIxNTIxNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2282152150","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-17T09:34:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2298300442,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyOTgzMDA0NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2298300442","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"51653a7f5aa9611b3df570721f1d041f647e8059","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/51653a7f5aa9611b3df570721f1d041f647e8059","created_at":"2019-04-24T19:43:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2298300443,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyOTgzMDA0NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2298300443","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.c
