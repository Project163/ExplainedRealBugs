We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs quickly discussed here : https://forum.rclone.org/t/could-rclone-support-nextcloud-owncloud-chunked-uploads/7423\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\nrclone v1.49.5\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.1\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\nUploads blocked by CloudFlare (capped at 100MB for the free plan) or maximum size file uploads.\r\nPlus, allow resuming file uploads when the connection is dropped, or a failure happened.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nFor Nextcloud, here is the procedure : https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/developer_manual/client_apis/WebDAV/chunking.html\r\nFor OwnCloud, I couldn't find anything in the docs, but on the forum : https://central.owncloud.org/t/chunked-file-upload-with-curl/21712 (it seems pretty similar to what Nextcloud does). Also found that, which seems to be the latest version of chunked uploads on OwnCloud : https://dragotin.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/owncloud-chunking-ng/\r\nFor other generics WebDav providers, it's not in the specs, so... 🤷‍♂ \r\nFrom there, you can add chunked options like \"--chunk-size\" or \"--chunk-number\".","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3666/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3666/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
