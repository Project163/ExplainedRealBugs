is a quick review of where CallXML/CallJSON are used with a `nil` response\r\n\r\n    $ git grep -l 'Call\\(XML\\|JSON\\)(.*, nil)'\r\n\r\n- backend/box/upload.go - Body is read and closed\r\n- backend/jottacloud/jottacloud.go - Remove: Body ignored - **Need to set opt.NoResponse**\r\n- backend/onedrive/onedrive.go - Copy: Body ignored - opt.NoResponse is already set\r\n- backend/opendrive/opendrive.go - deleteObject: Body ignored - opt.NoResponse is already set \r\n- backend/opendrive/opendrive.go - SetModTime: Body ignored - opt.NoResponse is already set\r\n- backend/webdav/webdav.go - purgeCheck: Body ignored - opt.NoResponse is already set \r\n\r\nSo I think the bug is that the jottacloud backend needed to set `NoResponse` in the Delete call options.\r\n\r\nHowever none of that is clear from reading the rest module docs, so I've updated those and put more comments in to help future readers.\r\n\r\nThese fixes are in the `fix-2637-leak-beta` branch and a release is below\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.rclone.org/branch/v1.43-152-g1ac6761f-fix-2637-leak-beta/ (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate it if you could give
