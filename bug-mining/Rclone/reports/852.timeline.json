What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nChunker wraps a stream to upload with a splitting reader and calls the underlying (base) put() in a loop.\r\nWhen a chunk is read completely, the wrapper returns EOF to base put and refills chunk limit\r\n(see https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/v1.53.1/backend/chunker/chunker.go#L1168).\r\nThe crypt backend appears to be special. After receiving EOF it calls Read() again.\r\nSince limit is already refilled, chunker feeds it the next chunk resulting in a wrong underlying upload.\r\n\r\nThis PR postpones refilling of the chunk limit to the next call of base Put() so that wrapper \"insists\" on EOF for the chunk.\r\nThe crypt overlay behavior is out of scope for this PR and not considered a bug.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR adds the chunker->crypt overlay chain to the integration suite. It's quick and low on resources.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4570\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3783018759,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzc4MzAxODc1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3783018759","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-18T14:58:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3783018878,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3ODMwMTg4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3783018878","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c797494d88ca77a4a1565f2939764df2297bac09","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/c797494d88ca77a4a1565f2939764df2297bac09","created_at":"2020-09-18T14:58:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3783159903,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3ODMxNTk5MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3783159903","actor":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9a9a13418894f4200c21943984d95c326ea6823a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/9a9a13418894f4200c21943984d95c326ea6823a","created_at":"2020-09-18T15:32:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
