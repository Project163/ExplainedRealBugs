If you do this, please follow best-practices by minting a key that is:\r\n\r\n1. RSA\r\n2. 4096-bit\r\n3. signed by your old key\r\n\r\n>  For a few years at least I'd need to sign the sums with both keys (which I think you can do with gpg).\r\n\r\nThat would be a good idea, but I think it's optional. What *is* required when changing keys is to write a `Key Transition Statement` that indicates you've changed keys, says why you've changed keys, and lists the fingerprint of the old and the new keys. Then you'd sign the statement by both the old key and the new key. And publish it in as many places as possible (GitHub, rclone.org, official forums, twitter, etc).\r\n\r\nIdeally you'd give a transition period of 1-6 months where (after you publish the Key Transition Statement), releases are signed by both keys. After that, just sign with your new release key.\r\n\r\nRiseup has a good guide/template on [Key Transition Statements](https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/key-transition):\r\n\r\n

GnuPG software releases since Nov 2014 don't support older, unsafe keys. The below quote is taken from the release notes of GnuPG 2.1 (released 2014-11-06):\r\n\r\n * https://gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html#nopgp2\r\n\r\n> **Removal of PGP-2 support**\r\n> \r\n> Some algorithms and parts of the protocols as used by the 20 years old PGP-2 software are meanwhile considered unsafe. In particular the baked in use of the MD5 hash algorithm limits the security of PGP-2 keys to non-acceptable rate. Technically those PGP-2 keys are called version 3 keys (v3) and are easily identified by a shorter fingerprint which is commonly presented as 16 separate double hex digits.\r\n> \r\n> With GnuPG 2.1 all support for those keys has gone. If they are in an existing keyring they will eventually be removed. If GnuPG encounters such a key on import it will not be imported due to the not anymore implemented v3 key format. Removing the v3 key support also reduces complexity of the code and is thus better than to keep on handling them with a specific error message.\r\n> \r\n> There is one use case where PGP-2 keys may still be required: For existing encrypted data. We suggest to keep a version of GnuPG 1.4 around which still has support for these keys (it might be required to use the --allow-weak-digest-algos option). A better solution is to re-encrypt the data using a modern key.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1699146346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maltfield","id":5026712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjY3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5026712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield","html_url":"https://github.com/maltfield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maltfield/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10232978838,"node_id":"LE_lADOAQ-n5M5vn0lVzwAAAAJh7t2W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/10232978838","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-30T13:14:23Z","label":{"name":"doc
