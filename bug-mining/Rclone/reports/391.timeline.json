time.\r\nI can confirm that it works with the following dirty hack in UnmarshalXML in webdav/api/types.go\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (v==\"\") {\r\n\t*t = Time(time.Now())\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the proper way of solving this might be evaluating the d:status tag and see if it is OK before parsing the properties.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2160219311","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1952#issuecomment-2160219311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1952","id":2160219311,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6AwlSv","user":{"login":"JC-LB","id":15707434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzA3NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15707434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB","html_url":"https://github.com/JC-LB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC-LB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-11T09:20:58Z","updated_at":"2024-06-11T09:20:58Z","body":"Just
