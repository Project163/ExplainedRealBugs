(eg Google Drive)\n> Google Drive\n> The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n> sudo rclone --files-from somefile.txt copy gdrive:/pi/\n> sudo rclone copy --files-from somefile.txt copy gdrive:/pi/\n> \n> A log from the command with the `-v` flag (eg output from `rclone -v copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\n```\nIt is only necessary to use a unique prefix of the subcommand, eg 'mo'\nfor 'move'.\nCommand copy needs 2 arguments mininum\n\n```\n\nI can't figure out the syntax to use the --files-from option.  The documentation mentions:\n\n> --files-from - Read list of source-file names\n> This reads a list of file names from the file passed in and only these files are transferred. The filtering rules are ignored completely if you use this option.\n> \n> Prepare a file like this files-from.txt\n> \n> file1.jpg\n> file2.jpg\n> Then use as --files-from files-from.txt. This will only transfer file1.jpg and file2.jpg providing they exist.\n\nHowever, I can't get that to work. What is the correct syntax to use?\n\nThis works:\nsudo rclone copy /etc/ethers gdrive:/pi/\nsudo rclone copy /etc/hosts gdrive:/pi/\nsudo rclone copy /etc/pihole/whitelist.txt gdrive:/pi/\nsudo rclone copy /etc/pihole/blacklist.txt gdrive:/pi/\n\nI'm just expecting to be able to put those 4 source paths into a single file, and then call that single file.  What am I missing?  I've tried without paths and simple filename inside somefile.txt, no difference.\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
