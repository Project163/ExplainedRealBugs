I'd like to use one S3 account to manage all of them via rclone. I'd like to configure one remote in rclone to do so.\r\n\r\nWith official aws command line tools I can do this, seamlessly. It auto-detects which bucket is in which region and it just works, out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\nRclone isn't able to do it, unless I manually specify the region for each operation. Looking it up is really hard, as I need to actually log into AWS via a web browser and check which bucket is in which region. \r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n1. It should query and display the region parameter in lsd, if AWS provider is \"AWS\".\r\n2. It should automatically do this for all commands silently (retry), which fails in \r\n```\r\nBucketRegionError: incorrect region, the bucket is not in ... region\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
