I actually wanted to include the log files, but there are a few issues:\r\n\r\n1.Due to the large number of uploaded files, the log files are too extensive to include. There are no obvious error messages, and I'm not sure how to extract them.\r\n2.There are concerns about personal privacy, and I prefer not to disclose what I have uploaded to others.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not a problem. Later, I'll try uploading some unrelated items to see if I can reproduce these errors. Then, I'll include the log files. Please feel free to attend to other matters in the meantime, as I've already written a repair program myself, and it's not urgent for me.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2071200852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2072803573","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7787#issuecomment-2072803573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7787","id":2072803573,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M57jHj1","user":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-23T15:54:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T00:37:40Z","body":"I generated a thousand test text files using the following Python\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom faker import Faker\r\nimport os\r\nimport random\r\n\r\nfake = Faker()\r\n\r\nfolder_path = \"test_folder\"\r\nos.makedirs(folder_path, exist_ok=True)\r\n\r\nnum_files = 1000\r\nfor i in range(num_files):\r\n    file_name = f\"file_{i}.txt\"\r\n    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)\r\n    with open(file_path, \"w\") as file:\r\n        file.write(fake.text())\r\n```\r\n\r\nI generated log files using the following command.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrclone copy --transfers=16  --drive-chunk-size=64M --log-file=rclone_log.txt --log-level=DEBUG ./test_folder p11:/test_folder\r\n```\r\nlog files here\r\n\r\n[rclone_log.txt](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/files/15079357/rclone_log.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time, I found 28 files that couldn't be read properly, along with many additional main files with names ending in (1).

I couldn't delete these invalids from server.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for your help. Regarding what you mentioned about unreadable files, they are probably the files I mentioned before that were directly uploaded to the trash, rather than being truly unreadable. Truly unreadable files can only be deleted and cannot be repaired! However, often when unreadable files are generated, duplicate files are also generated at the same time (I speculate this may be due to rclone's inability to write during retries). I simply replace the original file with the duplicate file. If there are no duplicate files, I can only re-upload through rclone.\r\n\r\nLet me summarize the issues I've encountered:\r\n\r\n1.Files may be directly uploaded to the trash, as you mentioned, and the only difference between them and normal files is a file parameter difference, trashed:true.\r\n\r\n2.Unreadable files, these files can also be filtered by parameters to search for, first by platform: Upload and there is no task_id. Normally, files uploaded through the platform will be marked as Upload and will always have a task_id.\r\n\r\n3.Hidden files, can also be found through the file parameter phase: PHASE_TYPE_PENDING.\r\n\r\n4.Duplicate files, I directly use the hash code to search, but may also need to compare files, because sometimes there are duplicate files in the same folder with different filenames, which may need to be handled specially.\r\n\r\nThese are roughly the situations I've encountered. If there's anything else you need help with, please let me know.

The probability of generating unreadable files on my end is quite high. Sometimes it's also noticeable in the official software, as normal media files have icons, but unreadable files cannot display icons and clicking on them does not play anything. It feels like the files were not fully uploaded, and they may only be marked with a task_id after a complete upload.\r\n2. Hidden files: I used to see them frequently, but they have been rare lately. However, it's good that you've found them.\r\n3. Duplicate files can actually be directly searched using the official software search function by entering (1) to query. Unless the original filename already has (1) at the end, it should be a duplicate file.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many of these issues were discovered through comparing file parameters, and I'm not sure of the exact cause of the problems. These are just personal observations, so they may not always be accurate.

that the recorded hash value has changed.\r\nThe hash value can be grabbed from the play link, which is provided in the play link, or from a third party client.\r\nSince rclone's synchronization is working fine, I've enabled -v, and there's no error on the console.\r\nAnd I found that when uploading with rclone, some files are deleted (emptied from recycle bin), but also space is not returned,

you try with [v1.67.0-beta.7930.223ba8626.fix-7787-pikpak-upload-conflict](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-7787-pikpak-upload-conflict/v1.67.0-beta.7930.223ba8626.fix-7787-pikpak-upload-conflict/)?\r\n\r\nWe've made some adjustments in this version to make uploads more reliable.\r\n\r\n### Checking upload status\r\n\r\nBy implementing `getTask()` API call and using `task_id` assigned for each upload, we ensure uploads are completed successfully on the server-side.\r\n\r\n### Cancel uploads\r\n\r\nIf an upload encounters an error, we cancel it to remove residual files (hidden or unreadable).\r\n\r\n### Force sleep and min sleep\r\n\r\nBased on experiment using 1000 small files as @cj-neo described and following commands to upload and check them,\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrclone copy ./test test:test --transfers=16 --log-file=test.log --log-level=DEBUG\r\nrclone check ./test test:test --download --log-file=test.log --log-level=DEBUG\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe number of first three retries of low level retry for 1000 files are\r\n\r\n1|2|3\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n826 | 59 | 28\r\n728 | 135 | 102\r\n662 | 81 | 63\r\n592 | 85 | 65\r\n517 | 44 | 34\r\n429 | 68 | 59\r\n\r\nmeaning that 5% (~50 of 1000) files require at least three retries which is +150 ms. Therefore, introducing a forced delay (or sleep) after uploading can be a reasonable approach to ensure server-side updates take effect. Note that this doesn't impact total execution time much.\r\n\r\nMoreover, minimum sleep for pacer is increased from 10 to 100ms to resolve following server error.\r\n\r\n```asciidoc\r\nhttp2: server sent GOAWAY and closed the connection; LastStreamID=1999, ErrCode=NO_ERROR, debug=\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Stop using `uploadByForm()`\r\n\r\nWe stop using `uploadByForm()` cause it is not as reliable as `uploadByResumable()` for a large number of small files.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2109810415/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wiserain","id":20354654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU0NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20354654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain","html_url":"https://github.com/wiserain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12799592243,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M6GZ0lKzwAAAAL66kcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/12799592243","actor":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-14T10:12:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12799592249,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M6GZ0lKzwAAAAL66kc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/12799592249","actor":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-14T10:12:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2111404519","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7787#issuecomment-2111404519","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7787","id":2111404519,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M592Xnn","user":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-15T01:10:27Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T01:10:27Z","body":"Thank

I found that some specific files cannot be uploaded successfully using rclone. I tried repeatedly to upload them dozens of times, but they always ended up in the same state where they couldn't be read.（The upload shows as successful and without errors, but cannot be read. The file properties are missing the task_id.） However, uploading them once using the official website was successful. I tested versions 1.66 and the modified 1.67 beta version you provided, and encountered the same problem. However, this issue occurs very rarely, approximately only once in twenty thousand files.\r\n\r\nBelow are two files that cause problems on my end. Could you please test them?\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pvHTbi0uEuI8OmEWvF6TKZtJPG_fTydX?usp=drive_link\r\n\r\n2. Additionally, I noticed a strange phenomenon where rclone uploads some files repeatedly. After executing an upload command and ending its execution, if I run the same command again, it uploads the same file once more. Regardless of how many times I execute the command, some files are repeatedly uploaded. When I checked the folder, I found that the file names had \"(1)\" appended to them, but I couldn't see the original file names, nor could I remove \"(1)\". It seems that they are hidden files, but my previously written program cannot detect them. Therefore, there might be other reasons causing the files to be hidden. I'm still unsure of the cause of this problem and will need to observe and test further.\r\n\r\nActually, there's more to it. A few days ago, something strange happened. I uploaded a folder named \"abc\", but instead of just getting one folder named \"abc\", I ended up with two folders: one named \"abc\" and another with random characters appended to it. The original contents were duplicated into both of these folders.\r\n\r\nInitially, when I uploaded the folder, I didn't explicitly indicate that it was a folder, for example: `\"c:\\abc\"`. Now, I've changed it to `\"c:\\abc\\\"` and it seems that I haven't encountered this strange issue again.\r\n\r\nHowever, I remember encountering similar issues when uploading to Google Drive and OneDrive before, but they were very rare and difficult to reproduce. Just thought I'd mention it since it happened again here.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look first at why some files cannot be uploaded successfully.\r\nAs for other issues, I'll let you know once If i have clear findings.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your generous assistance.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2111683832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2112036005","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7787#issuecomment-2112036005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7787","id":2112036005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M594xyl","user":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-15T09:35:38Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T11:42:32Z","body":"Sorry, the second issue I mentioned about the repeated uploading of files and hidden files is the same issue as before.

I've previously noticed the peculiarity of 0-byte files, so I skip them when checking for \"unreadable files.\" Regarding hash checks, as far as I understand, most cloud storage providers perform checks and remove duplicates after the files are uploaded. This is done to maintain consistency in upload processing and user experience. For example, when uploading via a web browser, the hash code cannot be known in advance, and pikpak also provides a web-based upload method. Therefore, for problematic files, we may need to use different upload methods and conduct more checks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the increased minimum sleep and forced sleep have minimal impact on me. Our previous tests involved a large number of small files, but in general, file sizes are not usually so small. Most of the time is spent on file transmission, so the impact will be even less. repeatedly checking for file errors may require more time, and I agree that this investment is worthwhile.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your continued assistance in modifying the program.

The file is 134GB, but I encountered the following error before even reaching 100GB:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n2024/05/08 20:56:55 ERROR : /Marvels.Avengers.zip: Failed to copy: failed to upload: MultipartUpload: upload multipart failed\r\n        upload id: C278C4F1FAD2486782772961F3CA663A\r\ncaused by: TotalPartsExceeded: exceeded total allowed configured MaxUploadParts (10000). Adjust PartSize to fit in this limit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt mentions that adjusting the PartSize parameter can allow the upload. Is the corresponding parameter max-upload-parts? However, I couldn't find this parameter in Pikpak. Currently, I only see two specific parameters for cloud storage services: --oos-max-upload-parts and --s3-max-upload-parts, but neither seems applicable to Pikpak.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the maximum file size limit for Pikpak is, but currently, uploading large files to Pikpak using rclone seems to be problematic.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I think rclone could handle large file uploads better. For instance, it could first check if the file size fits within the default PartSize before starting the upload. If it doesn't fit, the upload shouldn't start because uploading large files takes a lot of time. Encountering a PartSize error halfway through, requiring a settings adjustment and re-upload, wastes all the previous time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, maybe rclone could automatically adjust the PartSize based on the file size, completing the upload without any errors. I think it's challenging for the average user to know how large the file needs to be before adjusting the PartSize for a successful upload, Of course, these are just my humble suggestions and might be a bit demanding. I'm just offering some possible directions for improvement.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your help.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2115383202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2115452105","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7787#issuecomment-2115452105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7787","id":2115452105,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5-FzzJ","user":{"login":"wiserain","id":20354654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU0NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20354654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain","html_url":"https://github.com/wiserain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-16T14:46:44Z","updated_at":"2024-05-16T14:46:44Z","body":"> By the way, I wanted to report an issue I encountered a few days ago while uploading a large file.

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThis PR includes several attempts to improve upload reliability and to resolve potential file conflicts:\r\n\r\n* Checking upload status: Implemented `getTask()` to verify successful completion on the server-side for each upload.\r\n* Cancelling uploads on errors: Uploads encountering errors are cancelled to remove residual files.\r\n* Forced & Minimum Sleep:\r\n  * Based on experiments, a forced delay(500ms) is introduced after uploads to ensure server-side updates register (minimal impact on total execution time).\r\n  * Minimum sleep for pacer increased from 10ms to 100ms to resolve server errors.\r\n* Removed `uploadByForm()`: This method is less reliable for a large number of small files. We now solely use `uploadByResumable()`.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n#7787\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2119049807","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7787#issuecomment-2119049807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/7787","id":2119049807,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5-TiJP","user":{"login":"cj-neo","id":35209118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjA5MTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35209118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo","html_url":"https://github.com/cj-neo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cj-neo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-19T01:10:23Z","updated_at":"2024-05-19T01:10:23Z","body":"After these few days of testing, unfortunately, most of the previously mentioned issues still exist:\r\n\r\n1.

Duplicate files.\r\n\r\nThese problems all still persist, with the only issue resolved being that files are no longer being directly uploaded to the trash.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because I need to monitor the progress while uploading, it is difficult to provide DEBUG messages.
