Sometimes only 49,61,62,88,134 should show up out of 323 or so.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to reproduce his issue. Having `--fist-list` on the mount command though does seen to cause  rclone vfs/refresh command to run a lot faster in my and other cases. In my case it finishes up a 225TB gdrive in 1.5minutes. However once I remove it from the mount command it caused it to be very slow where it would time out. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be two issues here. \r\n1) vfs/refresh causing dirs to not be cached or are missing.
