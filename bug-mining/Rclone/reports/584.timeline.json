What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nSetting the `poll-interval` flag does not seem to be supported with a `union` remote. I have tried both with (`gdrive:` > `gcrypt:` > `union`) and without a `crypt` remote inbetween (`gdrive:` > `union:`) and both give me the same result: `union root '': poll-interval is not supported by this remote`.
