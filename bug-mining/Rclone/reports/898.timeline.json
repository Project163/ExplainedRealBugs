I'll merge that code in a moment.\r\n\r\nWhat you should try next is limiting the number of connections rclone makes using\r\n\r\n      --ftp-concurrency int               Maximum number of FTP simultaneous connections, 0 for unlimited\r\n\r\nOr the `concurrency` parameter in the config.\r\n\r\nFTP servers hate too much concurrency. You may need to reduce `--transfers` and `--checkers` down.  So if you want to start from the lowest setting, try `--transfers 1` and `--checkers 1` and `--ftp-concurrency 3`. If you set concurrency too low then rclone will deadlock, but you can try `2`.\r\n\r\nYou can also use `--check-first` to make sure rclone does the directory listing before doing any transfers which can help.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/755992213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4183811578,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE4MzgxMTU3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/4183811578","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e77532852307b4f86e8ed09038c4dfc717173db4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/e77532852307b4f86e8ed09038c4dfc717173db4","created_at":"2021-01-08T10:31:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5153936934,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxNTM5MzY5MzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/5153936934","actor":{"login":"negative0","id":12236512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM2NTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12236512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0","html_url":"https://github.com/negative0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/negative0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0e1dfd79afb18d65b31dd3e075ae8f0187c90717","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/negative0/rclone/commits/0e1dfd79afb18d65b31dd3e075ae8f0187c90717","created_at":"2021-08-13T06:10:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
