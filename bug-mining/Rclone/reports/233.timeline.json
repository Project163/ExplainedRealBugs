exceeding Google Drive's quota, locking downloads for 24 hours. Caching the entire drive structure, and adding new files by periodically checking the Google Drive changelog should dramatically reduce the queries used. It would also significantly increase the speed which applications such as Plex, or Sonarr can check for new files by scanning every folder.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/897/reactions","total_count":48,"+1":32,"-1":0,"laugh":3,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":10,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/897/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/261812989","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/894#issuecomment-261812989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/894","id":261812989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTgxMjk4OQ==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-20T22:58:47Z","updated_at":"2016-11-20T22:58:47Z","body":"I've
