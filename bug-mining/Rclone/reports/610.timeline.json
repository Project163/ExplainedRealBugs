- We kindly ask that you:\r\n\r\n  1. Fill out the issue template below - not doing so needs a good reason.\r\n  2. Use the forum if you have a question rather than a bug or feature request.\r\n\r\nThe forum is at: https://forum.restic.net\r\n\r\nThe forum is a better place for questions about restic or general suggestions\r\nand topics, e.g. usage or documentation questions! This issue tracker is mainly\r\nfor tracking bugs and feature requests directly relating to the development of\r\nthe software itself, rather than the project.\r\n\r\nThanks for understanding, and for contributing to the project!\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput of `restic version`\r\n--------------------------\r\nrestic 0.9.4 (v0.9.4-37-g7b8d1dc0) compiled with go1.11.4 on linux/arm64\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease add the version of restic you're currently using here, this helps us\r\nlater to see what has changed in restic when we revisit this issue after some\r\ntime.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhat should restic do differently? Which functionality do you think we should add?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nuploading more files in parallel through rclone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are you trying to do?\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nrestic uploads 4 files in parallel through rclone. Due to some weird limitations on the remote storage, they only allow 500kb speed or so per file uploaded, however, if we increase the number of parallels connections we can use more bandwidth and reduce backup time (tested and confirmed with rclone sync).\r\n\r\nExample of current rclone uploads to Jotta Cloud (just as an example, it can be with oneDrive, hubic, opendrive, b2, etc...) command used:\r\n\r\n`restic  backup /srv/dev-disk-by-label-DATAdroid  --exclude-file=/root/filter.restic -v -v  --repo rclone:oDroid-Jotta:/restic/dataDroid -o rclone.connections=\"10\"   -o rclone.args=\"serve restic --stdio --rc --rc-addr localhost:5582 --rc-no-auth --config /root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf --log-file /mnt/cache/log/restic.jotta -v --transfers 10 --stats=20s\"`\r\n\r\nachieving the following output...\r\n\r\n```\r\nTransferred:        1.307G / 1.316 GBytes, 99%, 1.616 MBytes/s, ETA 5s\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:                 0 / 0, -\r\nTransferred:          275 / 279, 99%\r\nElapsed time:    13m48.1s\r\nTransferring:\r\n *     data/45/45a7f45c3de3…0be968fb3887a4f3316f:  7% /4.005M, 163.955k/s, 23s\r\n *     data/4a/4a9a4b16f1a9…668a9089f9602d2c731e: 27% /4.593M, 451.721k/s, 6s\r\n *     data/97/97965e0121dc…c76f0b070a9b9876f7d4: 97% /4.146M, 565.974k/s, 0s\r\n *     data/e4/e4562dd9205e…1dfd2c0b293fa66dfc4b: 54% /4.599M, 520.954k/s, 4s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nhow it should be...\r\n\r\nas many files as the parameter rclone.connections (10 in this command), or a new parameter, is set up, so then we could be uploading 10 files (instead of our current 4, the default by rclone with no modifiers) reducing the time of the backups.\r\n\r\nI have seen in the code (restic/internal/backend/rclone/config.go), we can configure the number of connections, however, that does not change the number of uploads through rclone.\r\n\r\n`Connections uint option:\"connections\" help:\"set a limit for the number of concurrent connections (default: 5)\"`\r\n\r\nand in \r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc NewConfig() Config {\r\n        return Config{\r\n                Connections: 5,\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNevertheless, I guess above configurations are more about the number of connections to rclone rather than the amount of files to be uploaded in parallel. am I right?\r\n\r\n\r\nDid restic help you or made you happy in any way?\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nI am starting to use this great piece of software and I guess that can help me to keep my data safe, I would really like the idea of having a software fully customizable. Please, allow setting up a new parameter that will be the amount of parallels files to be uploaded. We can then extensively use more bandwidth uploading more files.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of experience uploading backup to cloud storage providers, and is very annoying having enough bandwidth to upload 1Tb in less than 12hours and spend 3 days or more in doing so....\r\n \r\n(1Tb of data to be uploaded to jotta through restic/rclone is taking 170hours).\r\n\r\nKeep doing such a good stuff!!, you
