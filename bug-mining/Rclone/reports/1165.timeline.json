mentioned in #6765, the Pikpak backend uses a media link as a link for object opening/download. This is based on the assumption that Pikpak always serves original contents in the first item of media, i.e., `Medias[0]`. It is quite bold but holds in most case.\r\n\r\nAfter examining the case @Computron010 reported, it looks like a server error. Both media links from `Medias[0]` and `Medias[1]` are pointing to the same file which is transcoded version of original media.\r\n\r\nIn this exceptional case, there's nothing we can do to check the validity of a media link before the actual download finished. So it is safe to remove the feature.

this.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1542080429/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wiserain","id":20354654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU0NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20354654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain","html_url":"https://github.com/wiserain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9210863737,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M5lSJBqzwAAAAIlAqB5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/9210863737","actor":{"login":"Computron010","id":56774862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Nzc0ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56774862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010","html_url":"https://github.com/Computron010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-10T12:01:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9210863752,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M5lSJBqzwAAAAIlAqCI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/9210863752","actor":{"login":"Computron010","id":56774862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Nzc0ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56774862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010","html_url":"https://github.com/Computron010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-10T12:01:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"wiserain","id":20354654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU0NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20354654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain","html_url":"https://github.com/wiserain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-10T12:39:52Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T12:39:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6997","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6997/labels{/name}","

This could lead to users downloading the wrong file, e.g. transcoded media.\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\nWe check the validity of a media link using the `fid` parameter in the link URL. This ensures that users always download the correct file object.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nCloses #6992 \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9213357190,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M5lSJBqzwAAAAIlKKyG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/9213357190","actor":{"login":"wiserain","id":20354654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU0NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20354654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain","html_url":"https://github.com/wiserain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a940052a9f2d6330ad1404205fc472af9e8c7c5e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wiserain/rclone/commits/a940052a9f2d6330ad1404205fc472af9e8c7c5e","created_at":"2023-05-10T15:59:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1542643068","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6992#issuecomment-1542643068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6992","id":1542643068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5b8t18","user":{"login":"Computron010","id":56774862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Nzc0ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56774862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010","html_url":"https://github.com/Computron010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Computron010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-10T18:40:08Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T18:51:04Z","body":"Is it required to completely remove this functionality?
