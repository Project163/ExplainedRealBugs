What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nI'd like to expose a subdirectory `photos` in my home directory to a semi-trusted device, over SFTP.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I'd add the following to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrestrict,command=\"rclone serve sftp --stdio ./photos\" ssh-rsa ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tested this against OpenSSH_8.5p1 and I am able to expose just my `photos` directory.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5311\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the
