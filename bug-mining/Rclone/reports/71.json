This means that if the output is copying small sizes that is also reflected on the input.\n## Solution A\n\nA one-line fix for this would be to slap on a bufio.Reader with a buffer size of, say a megabyte.\n## Solution B\n\nA better, but slightly more complex solution would be to have an asynchronous buffer, where the input reader is running all the time, unless the buffer is full. This would mean that output is not blocked by input and vice versa.\n\nThis would mean that for all transfers that if either input or output is bursty, the overall transfer will not be affected as much. \n\nThe buffer size could be something like 4x4MB per transfer.\n","closed_by":{"login":"klauspost","id":5663952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NjM5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5663952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost","html_url":"https://github.com/klauspost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klauspost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
