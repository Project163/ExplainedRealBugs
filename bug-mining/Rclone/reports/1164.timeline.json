What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nAdd support for a new backend `pikpak`\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nCloses #6429 \r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/advice-in-writing-a-new-backend/36022\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Reference\r\n\r\nAPI is not publicly available. Implementation for `uploadByResumable` is mostly from https://github.com/alist-org/alist/tree/main/drivers/pikpak\r\n\r\n#### Test results\r\n\r\nDue to the daily limit for creating objects, `test_all` is carried out with `maxtries=1` and disect sub-tests one bye one.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/go/bin/test_all -backends pikpak -maxtries 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll tests get passed after manual retries except\r\n\r\n`TestCheckSum`, `TestHashSums/Md5`, `TestSyncWithTrackRenames`, and `TestIntegration/FsMkdir/FsPutFiles/ObjectMimeType`\r\n\r\nI believe the first three are due to the empty md5 sums for uploaded files. The last is because it somehow returns wrong value as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== RUN   TestIntegration/FsMkdir/FsPutFiles/ObjectMimeType\r\n    fstests.go:1357: \r\n        \tError Trace:\t/home/me/wiserain/rclone/backend/pikpak/fstests.go:1357\r\n        \tError:      \tNot equal: \r\n        \t            \texpected: \"text/plain\"\r\n        \t            \tactual  :

checked files with a proper extension like '.txt' return mime as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more detail log, please find attached

@1265578519 The issue here is not about downloading multiple files at the same time. Multithread streams is to split a single large file into multiple segments and download them concurrently by making multiple partial requests. Is this working in the app you are using?\r\n\r\n我明白你说的意思，比特彗星具备这种功能，如下图，单个mp4文件总共使用18个线程下载\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6442439/230716219-a8bfcb40-f37b-486b-bfbb-51efd35618b4.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6442439/230716243-84b70d88-ed1d-4af6-8596-c69569cff261.png)\r\n\r\n但是我认为rclone没办法具备这个功能，因为rclone定位不是一个下载器。\r\n更多人使用rclone的用途是在webdav文件管理器中，此时无法具备多线程能力\r\n如果需要用rclone下载文件我可以提供代码参考以便开发多线程功能实现。\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1500861258/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"1265578519","id":6442439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDI0Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6442439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519","html_url":"https://github.com/1265578519","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8957473340,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M5imC-FzwAAAAIV6DI8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/8957473340","actor":{"login":"1265578519","id":6442439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDI0Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6442439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519","html_url":"https://github.com/1265578519","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-08T10:25:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8957473342,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M5imC-FzwAAAAIV6DI-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/8957473342","actor":{"login":"1265578519","id":6442439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDI0Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6442439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519","html_url":"https://github.com/1265578519","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1265578519/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-08T10:25:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1501105551","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6915#issuecomment-1501105551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6915","id":1501105551,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5ZeQ2P","user":{"login":"wiserain","id":20354654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzU0NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20354654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain","html_url":"https://github.com/wiserain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiserain/subsc
