I know I can execute `rclone version`, but then I need to perform string parsing and also I need to run a process instead of just accessing file properties.\r\n\r\nYou can also execute `rclone version --check` to see whether your version is up to date with the latest version.\r\n\r\n> Solution seems to be based on executing a command line utility, [GoVersionInfo](https://github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo), during the build process.\r\n\r\nThat looks like a good tool :-)\r\n \r\n> I could try to implement this myself, if you agree it is a good idea, but I am not proficient in go so may be needing some pointers along the way (for instance I am not sure if this introduces some changes to how the build process must be performed).\r\n\r\nYes if you'd like to have a go - that would be fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe production build is kicked off here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/fb61ed8506e68db0ea19c62a08daa9cdee59dda5/bin/cross-compile.go#L172\r\n\r\nSo you'd want to run the goversioninfo tool just once, probably in this

binary\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/fb61ed8506e68db0ea19c62a08daa9cdee59dda5/bin/cross-compile.go#L72\r\n\r\nYou can add build dependencies to rclone by adding them here - so you'd add `goversioninfo` here.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/fb61ed8506e68db0ea19c62a08daa9cdee59dda5/Makefile#L85-L87\r\n\r\nThe logos for rclone are in the top level graphics directory - I'd

If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the changes here\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake rclone.exe on windows include file properties such as product name, file description, version, as well as an icon.\r\n\r\nThe most useful would be the version information, then one could use PowerShell to retrieve the numerical version number `(Get-Item rclone.exe).VersionInfo.FileVersion`, and for instance compare it with latest released version by accessing GitHub API. I know I can execute `rclone version`, but then I need to perform string parsing and also I need to run a process instead of just accessing file properties.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nSee issue https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4304.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have
