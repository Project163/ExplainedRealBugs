So, If I am on 100 Mbps Plan, I will get 100 Mbps on both IPv4 and IPv6 seperately and I can use this to get total output of 200 Mbps if software (in this case rclone) is able to make use of it. I was able to test it by running two rclone instances with one binded to IPv4 and another to IPv6. But, This is a hectic process and can be troublesome to use when trying to upload or download a folder through single instance. Would be cool thing if rclone either by default make use of it or could add a flag to enable this feature.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nTry and Use IPv4 and IPv6 alternatively while downloading files from services which support Dual Stack Networks like Google Drive etc.\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
