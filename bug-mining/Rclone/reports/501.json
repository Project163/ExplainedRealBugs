uploading to remote storage from a URL would be a useful feature, for example:\r\n\r\n`rclone copy http:https://example.com/some_large_file.tar remote:/Files`\r\n\r\nThis would be useful for systems without enough free space to save the entire file before upload (for example a VPS).\r\n\r\nI understand that currently `rclone` needs to know the size of the file before upload (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/230#issuecomment-161762623), however properly configured webservers should send a [`Content-Length`](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13) header which indicates the size of the
