But it appears Windows associates the name with the drive letter, instead of the rclone remote name. So if I mount a different remote on the same drive letter, the old name shows up - not desired operation.\r\n\r\nThis request is to let me provide the Windows drive name with the \"rclone mount\" command.\r\nEven if I change the name after the remote is mounted, the next time I mount the remote, I want it to use the provided label.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nBy a command-line argument:\r\nrclone mount --label=\"MyDriveName\" remote: F:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrissv","id":3324281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQyODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3324281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv","html_url":"https://github.com/chrissv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrissv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2679/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
