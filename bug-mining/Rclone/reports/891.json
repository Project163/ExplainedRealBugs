What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nwhen `rclone ncdu` can't access a subpath of a given remote, it fails and quits and provides no way to skip/ignore the directory in question, thus making it completely useless on the whole remote.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose I have a shell where I log in as 'me', and where 'user2' has unique acess to her own subdirectory.\r\n\r\nThe filesystem looks like this:\r\n```\r\n$ ssh me@sftphost  ls -l\r\ntotal 240\r\ndrwx------   10 19463  user2  10 Feb  3 10:08 user2\r\ndrwx------   3 19463  me   9 Feb 27 03:30 dir1\r\ndrwx------   3 19463  me   9 Feb 27 13:33 dir2\r\ndrwx------   3 19463  me   9 Feb 27 04:35 dir3\r\n```\r\n\r\n(sftphost is an sftp remote where i connect as user 'me')\r\n```\r\n$ rclone ncdu sftphost:\r\n2020/02/27 18:25:57 Failed to ncdu with 4 errors: last error was: ncdu directory listing: ncdu listing failed: error listing \"user2\": sftp: \"Permission denied\" (SSH_FX_PERMISSION_DENIED)\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.49.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.12.9\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nUbuntu LTS\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nSFTP\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4014/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
