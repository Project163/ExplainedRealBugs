This may not be RFC compliant, but it **is** the s3 standard.\r\n\r\nIn the s3 backend in rclone we use the http time parser to parse this time which copes just fine - that uses http.ParseTime\r\n\r\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ParseTime\r\n\r\n> ParseTime parses a time header (such as the Date: header), trying each of the three formats allowed by HTTP/1.1: [TimeFormat](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#TimeFormat), [time.RFC850](https://pkg.go.dev/time#RFC850), and [time.ANSIC](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ANSIC).\r\n\r\nAnd it looks like AWS S3 is using the TimeFormat type\r\n\r\n> It is like [time.RFC1123](https://pkg.go.dev/time#RFC1123) but hard-codes GMT as the time zone. The time being formatted must be in UTC for Format to generate the correct format.\r\n\r\nSo I think the actual format is correct.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code, it makes an effort to change the time to UTC so the timezone looks correct too, however it doesn't test correct\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir /tmp/s3/bucket\r\nmkdir -p /tmp/s3/bucket\r\necho hello > /tmp/s3/bucket/file.txt\r\nTZ=GMT rclone serve s3 /tmp/s3\r\nTZ=MST rclone serve s3 /tmp/s3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd comparing the last modified with the two timezones\r\n\r\nGMT\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl --head http://127.0.0.1:8080/bucket/file.txt\r\n...\r\nLast-Modified: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 15:52:22 GMT\r\n```\r\n\r\nMST\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl --head http://127.0.0.1:8080/bucket/file.txt\r\n...\r\nLast-Modified: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 08:52:22 GMT\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo something is clearly wrong here.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion\r\n\r\n1. Disagree with you about the time format - it is correct\r\n2. Agree with you about the time being wrong\r\n\r\nMaybe this is an rclone problem after all!\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2564382099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2564382101","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8277#issuecomment-2564382101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8277","id":2564382101,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6Y2V2V","user":{"login":"cubic3d","id":4047015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDcwMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4047015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d","html_url":"https://github.com/cubic3d","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cubic3d/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-23T12:28:51Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T12:28:51Z","body":"Thank you for moving it to the right place and spending time to dig trough it :)\r\n\r\nI'm still very confused. Just to clarify: My main issue here is the missing padding `0` in `1 Jan 2006` vs. `01 Jan 2006`. You pointed to https://github.com/rclone/gofakes3/blob/5af388db693f099d6889be05a2b5dffc91e6c275/gofakes3.go#L1137-L1144 which explicitly defines the padding by the Go time layout string (the layout string is `Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05` and not `Mon, 2 Jan 2006 15:04:05`), but looses it if it serves the headers.\r\n\r\nI also tried to query real Amazon S3 resources as well as Minio, Hetzner (Ceph based), B2 and R2:\r\nSome examples\r\n```\r\ncurl --head https://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/2015119/282dc4fc748b58803e1aed76e9e8a952.pdf\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nx-amz-id-2: cm+Ma3QJYlS4Im1NTYI/5QuWu7T3oAynXFgNUw2qArVz9RZacuvv5Qgg3nxCCIB2xntTRnEoFzk=\r\nx-amz-request-id: 7D7XF0K267ZT0XD4\r\nDate: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:14:22 GMT\r\nLast-Modified: Sun, 08 Apr 2018 22:49:22 GMT\r\nETag: \"4a8714103017c379f725dbedb35fa0b4\"\r\nx-amz-version-id: nYd1ZmLqMpWIxPkGoqB4OavsqzFSTtEF\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nContent-Type: application/pdf\r\nContent-Length: 478540\r\nServer: AmazonS3\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 'https://[redacted].eu.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/[redacted]' -v\r\n\r\n[snip]\r\n* Request completely sent off\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\r\n* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Newsession Ticket (4):\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:50:57 GMT\r\n< Content-Length: 1313\r\n< Connection: keep-alive\r\n< Accept-Ranges: bytes\r\n< ETag: \"aa4dac536bb4642f24d76faa0455b5d0\"\r\n< Last-Modified: Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:04 GMT\r\n< Server: cloudflare\r\n< CF-RAY: 8f68230e8d81dcb5-FRA\r\n<\r\n[snip]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of them use the same and padded date format and never replied with a single digit. According to the linked issues on the s3 SDK the format was widened to RFC1123 at least in the v1 to allow other time zones than GMT. In the issue for v2 it's still claimed:\r\n\r\n> In the case of the RFC1123 format, GMT time zone is the value expected.\r\n\r\nSo it's still GMT only but the SDK seems to parse RFC1123 anyway. The RFC1123 defines the date as `date = 1*2DIGIT month 2*4DIGIT` which allows for a single digit, but also for 2-digit years. I think this has been overlooked, as the intention was to allow other time zones and not HTTP/1.1 incompatible timestamps.\r\n\r\nI think using the padded date format (as it should already be used according to the layout string in this module) would align with S3 and all other S3 compatible servers and be compatible with RFC1123, RFC822 and the fixed length requirements of HTTP's RFC2616:\r\n>HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats for the representation of date/time stamps:\r\n\r\n>\r\n>      Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123\r\n>      Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036\r\n>      Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format\r\n>The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents a fixed-length subset of that defined by RFC 1123 [8] (an update to RFC 822 [[9]](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec17.html#bib9)).\r\n\r\nAgree on the varying offset: That should not change as the files unix timestamp is in UTC. `TZ=GMT ls -la file` and `TZ=MST ls -la file` are different as expected since we change our interpretation. Using `TZ=MST rclone serve http .` and same with GMT, I can verify that the time in the header does not change and represents the actual time modified in UTC.
