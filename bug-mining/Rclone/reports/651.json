If this is not set, the copied file will simply default to the same bucket as the source file.\r\n\r\nFor the complete API documentation refer to the Backblaze B2 docs online:\r\n\r\nb2_copy_file: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_copy_file.html\r\nb2_copy_part: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/b2_copy_part.html\r\nLarge Files: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/large_files.html\r\n\r\nPlease note that we plan to make the new Copy File API public by the end of the day Thursday, June 27th.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3303/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
