How many entries might each directory have? If it has millions then that would explain the 10G memory usage.

you for the logs.\r\n\r\nFrom your log it is obvious what is happening - rclone is stuck in a directory loop\r\n\r\n    GET /?delimiter=%2F&encoding-type=url&list-type=2&max-keys=1000&prefix=gz-old-site%2Fattachment%2F201511%2F HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\nI decoded the XML here\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<ListBucketResult xmlns=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/\">\r\n  <Name>gz-gov-open-doc</Name>\r\n  <Prefix>gz-old-site%2Fattachment%2F201511%2F</Prefix>\r\n

<NextMarker>gz-old-site%2Fattachment%2F201511%2Fxybgn%2F</NextMarker>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `NextMarker` is set to `gz-old-site%2Fattachment%2F201511%2Fxybgn%2F` but rclone fetches `gz-old-site%2Fattachment%2F201511%2F` in the next response for some reason...\r\n\r\nRclone clearly is asking for a v2 listing type `list-type=2` but the response contains no `ContinuationToken` (see the docs here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html) - that is what is causing the loop. In fact the response is clearly a v1 listing type since it contains `NextMarker`.\r\n\r\nCan you try this please\r\n\r\n[v1.61.0-beta.6591.32a731543.fix-6600-s3-listing](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-6600-s3-listing/v1.61.0-beta.6591.32a731543.fix-6600-s3-listing/) on branch [fix-6600-s3-listing](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/tree/fix-6600-s3-listing) (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nIt should error out with\r\n\r\n> s3 protocol error: received listing v2 with IsTruncated set and no ContinuationToken. Should you be using `--s3-list-version 1`?\r\n\r\nAssuming it does, can you then try  `--s3-list-version 1`\r\n\r\nI just did a test with Alibaba OSS myself, and it looks like it doesn't properly support v2 listing, so rclone's default is incorrect.\r\n\r\nHere is another beta (with the previous change) - this should work without the `--s3-list-version` parameter\r\n\r\n[v1.61.0-beta.6592.acfa8ae87.fix-6600-s3-listing](https://beta.rclone.org/branch/fix-6600-s3-listing/v1.61.0-beta.6592.acfa8ae87.fix-6600-s3-listing/) on branch [fix-6600-s3-listing](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/tree/fix-6600-s3-listing) (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nIn summary I've added two fixes to rclone\r\n\r\n1. detect a List v1 server not supporting List v2 and return an error instead of a directory loop\r\n2. Change the default for `provider = Alibaba` to list v1\r\n \r\nFix 1. will stop the loops happening to the next unlucky user and 2) will fix it for you hopefully.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1337762435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1338855937","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6600#issuecomment-1338855937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6600","id":1338855937,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5PzVIB","user":{"login":"snailAlice","id":17794813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Nzk0ODEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17794813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice","html_url":"https://github.com/snailAlice","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snailAlice/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-06T06:31:57Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T06:31:57Z","body":"Thank you very much for your help.
