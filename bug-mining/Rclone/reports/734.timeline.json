thanks for that analysis - that looks interesting.\r\n\r\nAt the moment rclone is only looking at the `403` part (or `429` which is also generated) and the `userRateLimitExceeded` part.\r\n\r\nIgnoring those parts which are the same we get\r\n\r\n1. `User rate limit exceeded.`\r\n2. `User Rate Limit Exceeded. Rate of requests for user exceed configured project quota. You may consider re-evaluating expected per-user traffic to the API and adjust project quota limits accordingly. You may monitor aggregate quota usage and adjust limits in the API Console: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/quotas?project=xxxxxxxxx`\r\n\r\nwhere 1) is the permanent limit and 2) is the temporary one.\r\n\r\nSo what rclone could do is see if the error text is exactly `User rate limit exceeded.` and then wrap that into one of these errors\r\n\r\n1. FatalError - these stop the sync immediately\r\n2. NoRetryError - this doesn't stop the sync but won't cause low level or high level retries.\r\n3. NoLowLevelRetryError - this doesn't stop the sync or high level retries, but does stop low level retries.\r\n\r\nWrapping it in `FatalError` probably does what you want. Does this need to be gated with a flag? It is a drive specific option so it could be something like `--drive-stop-if-daily-upload-limit-reached`.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps specific enough that it doesn't need gating with a flag, not sure - what do you think?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to get a sample of the two messages using `-vv --dump responses` I'd like to see exactly what the HTTP headers and JSON message returned in the response is - there might be a more reliable signal than looking at the error text.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/573338087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2940747481,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk0MDc0NzQ4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2940747481","actor":{"login":"harryqt","id":18257605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU3NjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18257605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt","html_url":"https://github.com/harryqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-11T17:45:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2940747482,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5NDA3NDc0ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2940747482","actor":{"login":"harryqt","id":18257605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjU3NjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18257605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt","html_url":"https://github.com/harryqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harryqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-11T17:45:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2940747543,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50Mjk0MDc0NzU0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2940747543","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-11T17:45:49Z","milestone":{"title":"Help
