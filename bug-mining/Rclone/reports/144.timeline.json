#35, I get for some directories I would like to remove, an `SSH_FX_FAILURE` error. I updated your package's Go code yesterday. Therefore, I should have the fix of #35. What can I do in order to analyse this issue?\n\nAt the moment, all directories with this error uses UTF8 characters, e.g. umlauts like ö, ü, ä, etc.\n\nAs I am writing this, I got an idea: I switched from Windows 10 to Mac OS X, thus, my Go program runs now under Mac. I recognised yesterday, that the same Go code handles such file names with umlauts differently (Windows vs Mac). Or, at least, both operating systems deliver different strings to Go and therefore to this library. Because: All remote directories, which I cannot delete right now (`SSH_FX_FAILURE`) are created from the Go program under Windows 10 and cannot deleted from within Mac OS.\n\nPerhaps, this post helps some other users/developers. I will investigate this issue further and can close this issue later, if I had a solution.
