What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nCurrently `rclone check` supports matching two file trees by sizes and hashes.\r\nHowever, rclone does not support so called hash-SUM files.\r\nThese are produced by the de-facto standard family of GNU core utilities like [sha1sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum).\r\n\r\n### Use Cases\r\n\r\nSUM files provide end-to-end checksums, an invaluable tool where storage sums don't exist.\r\nThey serve the following use cases:\r\n- User-side \"cache\" of remote hashsums.\r\n- As a measure to detect [bit-rot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption#Silent) timely.\r\n- Tracking integrity across multiple data migrations.\r\n- Migration of ancient data corpus to incompatible provider.\r\n- And more...\r\n\r\n### File Naming\r\n\r\nThere exist two widely used naming schemes for SUM files:\r\n1. `MD5SUM`, `SHA1SUM`, etc - uppercase name without extension carrying the hash digest type right in the name,\r\n   usually located right beside the files to check.\r\n2. `something.md5`, `somethingelse.sha1`, etc - having hash type in extension.\r\n\r\n### File Format\r\n\r\nThe SUM file format is [very simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum#Hash_file_trees), has been stable for years and supported by a wide range of software. However, there is no official standard. GNU man pages ([md5sum](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/md5sum-invocation.html#md5sum-invocation) et al) is the _de-facto_ standard.\r\n\r\nSUM files are line oriented. They **don't record** the hash digest type - it should be known in advance.\r\nEach line contains:\r\n1. Hash digest\r\n2. Space character\r\n3. Another space or `*` (asterisk, see below)\r\n4. File name, up to the line end.\r\n\r\nThe asterisk modifier is a legacy artifact of _GNU coreutils_ builds for DOS/Windows where it used to denote that the file is _binary_ (with Unix line endings). It means nothing on Unix. The proposed implementation of SUM file support simply ignores asterisks and treats all files as _binary_ (no DOS line feed translation), following the [SUM file parser](https://github.com/ericlagergren/go-coreutils/blob/master/md5sum/checksum_common/check_sum.go#L85) in the [Go coreutils port](https://github.com/ericlagergren/go-coreutils/).\r\n\r\nThe \"distance\" between digest and file name **must** always be 2 characters, be it `\" *\"` for binary files or `\"  \"` (two spaces) for **ex** text files. The 3rd space, if any, will belong to the file name.\r\n\r\nNote: I could not find any real world use of the `\" |\"` modifier mentioned by @klauspost in https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/157#issuecomment-144439399.\r\n\r\n### Unimplemented Features\r\n\r\nBesides _ignoring asterisks_, this implementation will not:\r\n- perform _backslash unescaping_ (ancient hack to tackle extended unicode and whitespace in file names)\r\n- support DOS-related flags _--binary_ and _--text_ (we treat files as _binary_, use them as is and never translate EOLs)\r\n- handle logic of rarely used flags _--strict_ and _--zero_ from the [GNU manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/md5sum-invocation.html#md5sum-invocation)\r\n\r\nThese features could be implemented by future PRs, but I guess nobody will ever need them.\r\n\r\nNote that integration with rclone `fs.Hash` API (e.g. using SUM files as a transparent hashsum source or cache) is also out of scope for this PR.\r\n\r\n### Making Sum Files\r\n\r\nrclone can produce valid SUM files with command\r\n`rclone hashsum HASH REMOTE:PATH --output-file FILE [--download]`\r\n(one minor feature that I miss sometimes is sorting output by file name - one day I'm gonna submit a PR)\r\n\r\nStandard coreutils normally print SUM data to _STDOUT_ so the file can be **produced** by redirection `sha1sum /files > SHA1SUM`. To **check** file tree against a SUM file, use the `-c` flag like `sha1sum -c SHA1SUM /files`. The hash digest used is defined by the name of the executable but **not recorded anywhere** in the sum file. This pull request handles only the **check** case above.\r\n\r\n### CLI: Constraints\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to enroll the `-c` GNU convention into the rclone CLI flag family respecting the following constraints:\r\n1. The `-c` short flag is already taken, so we use upper-case `-C` to feel as close as possible.\r\n2. The `--checksum` long flag is also taken, so we use `--checkfile` (no dash since it's a noun).\r\n    Probably `--sum-file`  would be closer to the file format name, but the first letter `c` better correlates with the short flag. See a note below.\r\n\r\n### CLI: Variants\r\n\r\nThe patch introduces a single internal function `operations.CheckSum` and the following command-line interfaces for it:\r\n\r\n1. The `hashsum` command gains new flag `--checkfile SUMFILE`, ex.:\r\n   `rclone hashsum CRC32 -C sumfile.crc32 remote:path/to/files`\r\n2. Commands `sha1sum` and `md5sum` also gain this flag, ex.:\r\n   `rclone sha1sum --checkfile SHA1SUM remote:path/tofiles`\r\n3. New command `checksum HASHNAME SUMFILE REMOTE:PATH` is added, ex.:\r\n   `rclone checksum md5 remote:path/to/MD5SUM remote:path/to --exclude MD5SUM`\r\n4. The `check` command gains a new form with **3** arguments, ex.:\r\n   `rclone check HASHNAME SUMFILE REMOTE:PATH`\r\n5. The `check` command in the current 2-argument form\r\n   gains the new flag `--checkfile HASHNAME`.\r\n\r\nAs the last case feels slightly out of sync, let me bring an example:\r\n```\r\nrclone check REMOTE1:PATH1 REMOTE2:PATH2     # match two file trees by hash/size\r\nrclone check -C sha1 SUMFILE REMOTE:PATH     # check file tree against a SUM file by hash\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the variants are placed in separate commits within this PR so **reviewer can decide** which are good for final squash/merge and which are doomed.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n1. In all cases above the SUM file can point to a remote object using the `REMOTE:PATH` notation as well as be a local file\r\n   (SUM files are frequently distributed within the same tree as the data).\r\n2. The new `rclone checksum` command supports all extended reporting features from `rclone check`,\r\n   like `--combined`, `--missing-...` and so on.\r\n3. The `md5sum`, `sha1sum` and `hashsum` commands _do not_ support extended check reporting features.\r\n   Instead, they work as if `--combined -` was supplied (i.e. _all sigils_ are reported to **stdout**, unless `--progress` is enabled).\r\n   This behavior is compatible with `-c` in GNU utilities.\r\n4. All proposed commands support filtering, which can be useful if a sum file is located beside the files to be checked.\r\n5. All variants support the `--download` flag and respect `--checkers`.\r\n6. The `--checkfile` option might be named as `--check-from` or `--check-by` (with short name `-C`),\r\n   or just `--check` if not taken.
