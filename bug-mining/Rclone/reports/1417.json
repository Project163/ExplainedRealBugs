The sync actually happens successfully, but rclone just keeps running and outputting the elapsed time stats forever. I have let it go for days without exiting. It does not appear to be doing anything. All transfer activity is stopped, the \"Listed\" number doesn't increment, the DEBUG lines showing decisions being made about transferring/deleting/filtering files stopped, etc.\n\nBacktrace when killed here: https://gist.github.com/neilschelly/a6b758ac7802ca360c1cbc7f306aaccd\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n\n```\n$ /usr/local/bin/rclone version\nrclone v1.71.0\n- os/version: oracle 8.10 (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 5.15.0-306.177.4.el8uek.x86_64 (x86_64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: amd64\n- go/version: go1.25.0\n- go/linking: static\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\n\nOracle Linux 8.10, 64-bit\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\n\nThe source is the OCI Object Storage accessed via Swift. The destination is AWS S3. I know it's not ideal to use Swift to access an Oracle Object Store bucket, but the bucket is not mine, and it's not in my power to change how I can authenticate to it. I don't know that that is related in this case anyway.\n\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\nThe problem was reproduced with these command line arguments.\n\n```\n/usr/local/bin/rclone --config CONFIGFILE sync SWIFT:BUCKETNAME AWSS3:BUCKETNAME/PATH/ --log-level DEBUG --size-only --fast-list\n```\n The debug output I attached is from these command line arguments:\n\n```\n/usr/local/bin/rclone --config CONFIGFILE sync SWIFT:BUCKETNAME AWSS3:BUCKETNAME/PATH/ --log-level DEBUG --size-only --fast-list --transfers 8 --delete-during --max-delete 1000 --max-age 7d\n```\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/neilschelly/a6b758ac7802ca360c1cbc7f306aaccd\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
