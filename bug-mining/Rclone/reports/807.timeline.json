I know this topic has been discussed already but it would be really helpful if this feature could be implemented some day. Reason is that objects in S3 or Ceph RGW can be tagged by using curl for example. These tags were organized by the object storage and there is no need to find a way to make tags compatible to metadata from a common filesystem of an OS like mac or linux because they only live in object store but can be useful in case searching or categorization.\r\n\r\nMentioned discussion:\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1523\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts. thanks\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3390/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
