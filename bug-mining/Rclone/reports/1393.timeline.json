thanks for the quick response and for pointing out the documentation note.\n\nHowever, I’d like to kindly suggest reconsidering this behavior from a usability and safety perspective.\n\nUsing `--exclude` or `--include` with `purge` currently does not throw an error, but the flags are silently ignored, which can easily lead to unintentional full deletion. This can be especially dangerous if a user expects the filters to work as they do with other commands like `delete` or `sync`.\n\nI fully understand that this is documented, but documentation alone doesn’t prevent accidents, especially with a destructive command like `purge`.\n\nMy proposal is just to make `rclone purge` fail fast when incompatible filtering flags are used, and display a clear error such as:\n\n````\nError: --include/--exclude filters are not supported with 'purge' (purge will delete everything unconditionally)\n````\n\nThis kind of safety check would make rclone more robust, especially for scripts or automated systems, where safety and predictability are critical.\n\nThanks again for your time and work on the project","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2786205353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bmailhe","id":5063780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5063780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe","html_url":"https://github.com/bmailhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmailhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17170261496,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M6xc_Y3zwAAAAP_bWX4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/17170261496","actor":{"login":"SLoeuillet","id":6066787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjY3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6066787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet","html_url":"https://github.com/SLoeuillet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SLoeuillet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-08T12:35:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17177341877,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAQ-n5M6xc_Y3zwAAAAP_2W-1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/17177341877","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bbaa1d14f313f7018f5aadff42e4c9345d06e30a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/bbaa1d14f313f7018f5aadff42e4c9345d06e30a","created_at":"2025-04-08T20:13:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2787558280","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8491#issuecomment-2787558280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8491","id":2787558280,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6mJsOI","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-08T20:15:08Z","updated_at":"2025-04-08T20:15:08Z","body":"I
