rclone v1.36\r\n- Ubuntu Server 16.04, 64-bit\r\n- Backblaze B2\r\n\r\nThe rclone command (includes those I've also tried):\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone sync ~/files b2remote:files --transfers=64

The code I'm emulating was added in commit 6152bab28, which was added in #1545 to fix issue #1480.\r\n\r\nI've not added any tests, as there don't seem to be tests directly for the `--skip-symlinks` function. That said, that function does seem to be tested in passing, as the test code for checking config precedence orders uses that function…\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
