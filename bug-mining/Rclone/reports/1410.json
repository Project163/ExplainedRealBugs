Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:\n> ```\n> kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)\n> ```\n\ndoing this just kills the server, instead of flushing the directory cache.\n\nsmall sidenote: i'm trying to use SIGHUP instead of a remote control server because im going to have multiple instances of rclone serve, and dont want to have 4 http servers constantly running\n\n\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\n```\nrclone v1.69.3-DEV\n- os/version: alpine 3.22.0 (64 bit)\n- os/kernel: 6.1.115-vendor-rk35xx (aarch64)\n- os/type: linux\n- os/arch: arm64 (ARMv8 compatible)\n- go/version: go1.24.3\n- go/linking: dynamic\n- go/tags: none\n```\n\n\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\nAlpine Linux, aarch64\n\n\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
