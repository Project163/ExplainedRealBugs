As a workaround, I took the file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt from my debian 8 and copied it into my NAS. Now rclone is accepting my server certificate. Not sure where wget is looking for CA but I don't have debug tools on my NAS to strace it.\n\nThe insecure flag should help for testing. In my case, I had to set a valid certificate to start testing rclone. I think should be easy to implement and would be very useful.\n\nThe gateway is just one PHP file + one SSL certificate (free with CloudFlare) https://github.com/oderwat/hubic2swiftgate and only used for authentication process, file transfer connects directly to Hubic openstack API to get full speed. As hubic authentication is not \"standard\", I don't see the point to implement it. The gateway is still needed for other applications that refused to implement Hubic as CyberDuck https://trac.cyberduck.io/ticket/7764 Though, if you want to implement it, Hubic API Docs can be found here https://api.hubic.com/console/ and a sandbox here
