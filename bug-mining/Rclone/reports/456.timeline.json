What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\nrclone v1.36\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nSMP Debian 3.16.39-1+deb8u2 (2017-03-07)\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nSFTP\r\n> The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrclone copy XX_SFTP:/ GS_XX:XX --include=XX* -vv --size-only --transfers=2\r\n> A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n2017/05/01 17:13:48 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.36\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"copy\" \"XX_SFTP:/ XX:XX\" \"GS_XX:XX\" \"--include=XX*\" \"-vv\" \"--size-only\" \"--transfers=2\"]\r\n2017/05/01 17:13:58 INFO  : Storage bucket XX path XX: Modify window is 1s\r\n2017/05/01 17:13:58 DEBUG : YYFILE: Excluded from sync (and deletion)\r\n2017/05/01 17:13:58 DEBUG : XXFILE: Sizes identical\r\n2017/05/01 17:13:58 DEBUG : XXFILE: Unchanged skipping\r\n2017/05/01 17:13:58 ERROR : XXFILE2: Failed to copy: failed to open source object: Open failed: sftp: \"The requested operation cannot be performed because there is a file transfer in progress.\" (SSH_FX_PERMISSION_DENIED)\r\n\r\nOnly 1 transfer can be done successful. when \"--transfers=1\" everything works fine. I can transfer multiple files from/to that same SFTP using lftp. What is the logical difference here? rclone is not opening multiple connections?

The latter of the two only works for downloads. While i didn't do a ton of testing i was able to pull up to 35+MB/s. This is in line with what i could do with filezilla(Maxing my connection).

managed to fix this issue by using a different interface in the sftp package :-)\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.rclone.org/v1.41-069-gd4213c0a/ (uploaded in 15-30 mins)\r\n\r\nCan you give it a test and see if you agree?\r\n\r\nIn my tests the above works at the same rate as the `sftp` binary.  This may still be slower than FileZilla but it was over 10 times faster on a 100mS ping roundtrip link.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/391744952/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/391766449","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1158#issuecomment-391766449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1158","id":391766449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTc2NjQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"justusiv","id":1114622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ2MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1114622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv","html_url":"https://github.com/justusiv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justusiv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-24T15:54:39Z","updated_at":"2018-05-24T16:31:28Z","body":"@ncw maxed my connection at 45MB/s!
