To get these files, I am forced to go via the Webdav solution. Unfortunately, the files fail to copy due to a 400 Bad Request. \r\n\r\nI investigated and the issue is a result of the headers being reset during a redirect. The func ClientWithHeaderReset() inside rclone/lib/rest/rest.go is doing this.\r\n\r\nI rebuilt the code with the header reset code removed and it works. \r\n\r\n```go\r\n//for k, v := range headers {\r\n//    if v != \"\" {\r\n//        req.Header.Set(k, v)\r\n//    }\r\n//}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would put forward that it is not always required to reset the headers on a redirect.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.43.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux Centos 7 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
