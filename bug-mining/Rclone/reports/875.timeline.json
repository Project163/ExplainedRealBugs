quite like to put a section on reducing costs in the s3 docs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this?\r\n\r\n## Reducing costs\r\n\r\nBy default rclone will use the modification time of objects stored in S3 for syncing.  This is stored in object metadata which unfortunately takes an extra HEAD request to read which can be expensive.  To avoid this when using `rclone copy/move/sync` use `--size-only` or `--checksum`.  (Note that using `--checksum` will MD5 all the files in the sync which may take some time) Another solution is to use `--update and --use-server-modtime` - there is a section about this LINK.  . Eg\r\n\r\n    rclone sync --fast-list --size-only /path/to/source s3:bucket\r\n    rclone sync --fast-list --update --use-server-modtime /path/to/source s3:bucket\r\n\r\nRclone's default directory traversal is to traverse each directory individually.  This takes one transaction per directory.  Using the `--fast-list` flag will read all the files into memory first using a small number of transactions (one per 1000 objects).  See section on `--fast-list` LINK.\r\n\r\nNote that if you are only copying a small number of files into a big repository then `--no-traverse` is a good idea.  You can do a \"top-up\" sync very cheaply by using `--max-age` and `--no-traverse` to copy only recent files, eg \r\n\r\n    rclone copy --min-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/source s3:bucket\r\n\r\nIf using `rclone mount` or any command using the VFS (eg most of `rclone serve`) then you might want to consider `--no-modtime` which will stop rclone reading the modification time off every object which will save a HEAD
