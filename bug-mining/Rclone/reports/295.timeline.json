I have to delete it with the ACD website... I just uploaded about 5to of data. That the one I notice \"by accident\", but of 72k files, I guess there is other bug like this...\r\n\r\nOf course I tried to delete, reup, etc, same thing.\r\n\r\nEDIT : Ok i can confirm other files are impacted. Easy way to find them are to start a sync (with no change on the source). Then in the log, I will see a lot of files being deleted. It's the ones with a screwed name. After the sync is finished, the files uploaded have still a screwed name, and are deleted again (and reup again) if I start another sync. \r\n\r\nBTW sorry for my english, it's not my native language.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/292785661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rootax","id":22431162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDMxMTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22431162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax","html_url":"https://github.com/Rootax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rootax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/292919502","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1315#issuecomment-292919502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1315","id":292919502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjkxOTUwMg==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-10T11:10:18Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T11:10:18Z","body":"@sweharris

That's... annoying.\r\n\r\nI can replicate:\r\n```\r\n$ rclone copy asdf foo:TV/asdf\r\n$ rclone ls foo:TV\r\n        0 asdf/x1\r\n$ rclone moveto foo:TV/asdf foo:\"TV/Avatar The Last Airbender\"\r\n$ rclone ls foo:TV                                            \r\n        0 JEjCjA cqn UjBC JrAknwmnA/x1\r\n$ rclone ls Amazon:foo \r\n       32 170.XZ/0.JEjCjA cqn UjBC JrAknwmnA/169.A5\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see the \"0.JEj...\" part.  That 0 means that the calculated rotate distance was zero, and the _deobfuscate_ routine takes the zero to mean \"no rotation\" (which should normally only happen when the string isn't a valid runeString).  \r\n\r\nChanging one character - eg \"Avatar the Last Airbender\" caused a different rotate distance to be calculated which didn't suffer the problem.\r\n\r\nI'll take a look today, but it may not be until after work (depending on how busy I get).

Approximately 1 in 256 files would be expected to hit this problem.  (Even though the sum is zero, the actual rotation isn't zero because we add the nameKey afterwards to get the real rotation distance).\r\n\r\nNow there's some ways I can fix this:\r\n1) Change the calculation  (eg \"(dir mod 255 ) + 1\").\r\n2) Change what we store in the filename (eg \"dir+1\" as the prefix)\r\n3) kludge things; if the sum is calculated as 0 then make it 1\r\n4) Change the \"invalid string\" flag (eg use a \"!\" instead of a \"0\" as the first character).\r\n\r\nOptions 1 and 2 will incompatible with existing obfuscated filenames because the filenames generated won't match.  All existing obfuscated files will need to be uploaded.  Sure, it's a beta version, but it may hurt a number of people.  Option 3 will keep compatibility with approx 99.6% of all files; the existing \"0\" files will need to be re-uploaded.  Option 4 will break any current \"invalid unicode\" files but everything else should work correctly.  I expect (but can't prove) this to be a small number.\r\n\r\nI think this is a decision for @ncw as to how he would like to see it done... each option will have some

To compare that to a local tree you'd need to do an \"rclone ls acd-my-user-encrypted\" and then compare the results to a local \"find . -type f\" (with sorting and filtering; it's a simple script).  Directory misnames (as in your \"Airbender\" example) are the most annoying, because every file in that directory is good, but the directory name is bad.\r\n\r\nOf course only obfuscated files are impacted; if you use \"none\" or \"standard\" for filename_encryption then you're not impacted.\r\n\r\nFor the \"obfuscated\" case, option 4 from my list of fixes would make these files work again without any change, as long as the original filename was valid unicode (so if the filenames were pure ASCII then you'd be fine).  Any files with broken unicode names would need to be re-uploaded.   I expect that to be the least impactful solution (and is my preferred option), but since all options have impact I'm deferring to @ncw as to what fix he'd like to see.\r\n\r\nThere are some kludges you can do for immediate relief, but they may not be compatible, going forward.  For example, from the ACD web UI, any \"0.randomstuff\" entry you see, you could rename to \"0.good_name\".  Now the current rclone interface will show it as \"good_name\".  If we pick option 4 as the go-forward solution then you'll later need to rename it to \"!.good_name\", so this _is_ just a kludge and not recommended...
