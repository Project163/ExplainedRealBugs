Therefore it will use the 1024 multiplier, leading to the wrong count.\r\nIn my test, it reports 13.183k files but when I enter, the objects are 13499. Notice how 13.183*1024=13499.392.\r\n\r\nThis is the piece of code I'm talking about.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nif u.showCounts {\r\n    if count > 0 {\r\n        extras += fmt.Sprintf(\"%8v \", fs.SizeSuffix(count)) // <--- HERE\r\n    } else {\r\n        extras += \"         \"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ivandeex","id":9028053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9028053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex","html_url":"https://github.com/ivandeex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivandeex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
