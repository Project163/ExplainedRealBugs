You can request upload status to get a more detailed list of missing ranges.\r\n\r\nSo we could assume if we get a 416 on a retry that the server got it already and to skip the chunk.\r\n\r\nPerhaps better would be to get the upload status to work out where we are.  Our hands are somewhat tied here - if the server is missing stuff that isn't in the current chunk we'll have to abort.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @Cnly
