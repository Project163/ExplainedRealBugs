When right-clicking on the file on Google Drive, I can \"Add to My Drive\" or \"Make a copy\"\r\n\r\nExample 2: On the \"Shared with me\" is a \"video.mp4\", shared with a public URL however it is stored in a Team Drive. When right-clicking on the file on Google Drive, I can \"Make a copy\" but can not \"Add to My Drive\", only \"Star\" it.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.48.0-067-g0a1169e6-beta (was using latest stable)\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nUbuntu linux/amd64 (on Google Colab Notebook)\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
