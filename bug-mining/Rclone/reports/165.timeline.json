**NB** I've put the files from this report in [a gist](https://gist.github.com/ncw/1beadd7258ca87a6ca55)  which you may find easier to use.]\n\nTo reproduce, run the python program `onedrive_bug.py`.  This needs the python onedrivesdk. This uploades the file `goof.png` repeatedly, to the root of your onedrive as `1.png`, `2.png`, etc.\n\nIf you run it after a while you'll see a size mis-match.\n\nThis means that the 97k file is apparently 200k.  If you look in the web interface it also appears as 200k, however if you download it is really only 97k.\n\nI don't think this is a bug in the python library, rather a bug in Onedrive.\n\nI think the bug depends on the particular file being uploaded.\n\nA user of my program `rclone` ( @Darkvater ) noticed the file corruptions originally in ncw/rclone#399 and supplied the png file which is used for the demo here.\n\nThis means that this bug has been reproduced with the Python SDK and my own Go SDK and from at least 4 different environments (computers, OS, net connections etc).\n\nThis log is from running `onedrive_bug.py` on Linux Ubuntu Wily 15.10 with python 2.7.10 and the onedrive sdk master installed in a virtualenv.\n\n```\n$ python onedrive_bug.py \nCreated new window in existing
