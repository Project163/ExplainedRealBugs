It's not wrong, but it is just a transient error and a retry would very likely succeed and allow the whole operation to succeed cleanly\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n1.42\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu 16.04 64 bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nAWS S3\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nrclone copy --retries 1 --size-only --immutable --ignore-checksum --max-delete 0 --no-gzip-encoding /some/local/dir aws-${REGION}:somebucketname\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\nSorry, it'd be huge.  The relevant lines are:\r\n2018/08/30 08:08:06 ERROR : <redacted directory name>: error reading destination directory: SerializationError: failed to decode REST XML response\r\ncaused by: unexpected EOF\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that making the directory listing code use low-level retries might help, or else making S3 use Pacer to handle retries.  But my Go isn't strong enough yet to help write a patch .  Happy to test any potential fixes in real-world scenarios, if it'd help.","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
