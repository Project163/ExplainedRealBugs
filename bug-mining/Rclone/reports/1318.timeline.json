What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nExisting:\r\n\r\nIn serve sftp function `loadAuthorizedKeys`, after reading the authorized keys file, `ssh.ParseAuthorizedKey` from `golang.org/x/crypto` is called with the file content as input to parse a single authorized key. It silently skips invalid lines and comment lines until it is able to parse a key, and returns it together with remaining text. If it is unable to find a key, it returns an error. We repeat the call `ssh.ParseAuthorizedKey` with any remaining file content, in a loop, while collecting all parsed keys. However, this means that when reaching a point in the file content where there is remaining text but from which no valid keys can be parsed, such as comment lines at the end of the authorized keys file, we will end up getting an error return. The error is returned by `loadAuthorizedKeys`, it is not reported back to user unless authorized keys file were explicitly used with `--authorized-keys` option, but one will get a log entry \"NOTICE: Loaded 0 authorized keys from ...\".\r\n\r\nNew:\r\n\r\nIgnores the error returned by `ssh.ParseAuthorizedKey`. The only error that can be returned is that no key was found. This makes sense, since it already silently skips invalid lines and comment lines and returns success as long as it can find one key. If one wants to ensure a key was found, then one can just count the number of returned keys instead.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes
