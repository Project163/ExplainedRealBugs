just updated to the latest beta of rclone ( v1.43-036-g89be5cad-beta) on what Microsoft Graph code was merged into v 1.43, however on my personal OneDrive doing an rclone lsd on a Shared Folder only works on the first level of directories, example: `rclone lsd myonedrive:sharedfolder1/`.\r\n\r\nTrying a `rclone lsd myonedrive:sharedfolder1/sharedfolder2/` delivers this error:\r\n```\r\n2018/09/05 00:32:31 ERROR : : error listing: directory not found\r\n2018/09/05 00:32:31 Failed to lsd: directory not found.\r\n```\r\nI did checked and sharedfolder2 in fact exists in the directory tree (this works well ok on non-shared folders).\r\n\r\nThe same happens when trying to copy files from `myonedrive:sharedfolder1/sharedfolder2/` to my local instance as it says\r\n```\r\n2018/09/05 00:34:31 ERROR : : error listing: directory not found\r\n2018/09/05 00:34:31 Failed to lsd: directory not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny ideas on why listing directories is not working properly on shared folders?\r\n\r\nThis may be related to what is described here [https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-is-not-working-outside-of-the-root-of-crypt-remote/6697/2](url) for crypt folders.","closed_by":{"login":"Cnly","id":3103188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly","html_url":"https://github.com/Cnly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Cnly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2536/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
