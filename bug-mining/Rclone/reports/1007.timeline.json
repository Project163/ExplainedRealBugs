touch:\r\n- Touch on existing file:\r\n  - Updates timestamp (same as before)\r\n  - Note: Specifying option --recursive (described below) have no effect, meaning it still touches the single file. This is up for debate...\r\n- Touch on existing directory:\r\n  - Default is to touch any files in that directory non-recursively\r\n  - If option --recursive then recursively touching all files in subdirectories as well\r\n  - Filtering options can be used\r\n- Touch on non-existent path:\r\n  - Default is to create it as an empty file (same as before)\r\n  - Does nothing if --no-create (notice, not an error) (same as before)\r\n  - Does nothing if --recursive (notice, not an error), for consistency --recursive never creates *new* files.\r\n- Supports --interactive and --dry-run\r\n-
