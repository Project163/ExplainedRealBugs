must!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1514692727/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"technicalguy","id":5120940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA5NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5120940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy","html_url":"https://github.com/technicalguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/technicalguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9046338665,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M5bGM60zwAAAAIbNCxp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/9046338665","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-19T12:59:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9046338677,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M5bGM60zwAAAAIbNCx1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/9046338677","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-19T12:59:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1514997231","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/6685#issuecomment-1514997231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6685","id":1514997231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5aTQXv","user":{"login":"vinner83","id":122420547,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0v9Qw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122420547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83","html_url":"https://github.com/vinner83","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinner83/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-19T16:07:39Z","updated_at":"2023-04-19T16:07:39Z","body":"I

Why don't you just do and \"rclone copy\" from Path1 to Path2, and then an \"rclone copy\" from Path2 to Path1?\r\n> This is much simpler, there is no need to read 2 times LSL files and to loop for missing Path2 files, and the result should be the same. Am i missing something?\r\n\r\nThe first-sync optimization is deferred for now since its not broke and should be rarely run.\r\n\r\n### https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/5164#discussion_r688913159 (ncw)\r\n\r\nSo `--resync` is asymetrical?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better implemented by the equivalent of\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone copy --update Path1 Path2\r\nrclone copy --update Path2 Path1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.

It would be intended as more of a short-term stop-gap to tide us over while we wait hopefully for full dir metadata support, which would be a much more complicated project.\r\n\r\nFor whatever it's worth -- I ended up creating this command for my personal use, and it is working beautifully for my purposes. You are right that it required adding a new optional interface, but once I did that, I was surprised at how minimal the other required changes were.

I've been wanting this functionality for so long and it appears that you've implemented support for it in a way that will work for me. I'm going to build your fork and give it a try but just from a cursory glance at the source, it looks like it will do exactly what I want.
