to https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-how-to-access-google-drive-file-from-google-backup-and-sync-computer-folder/4000\r\n\r\nThe new official Google \"Backup and Sync\" client adds new folders to Google Drive under \"Computers\" in the web UI, which seem to be marked with these file properties in drive API:\r\n```\r\n\"descendantOfRoot\": false,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe top level folder (\"My PC\" or \"My MacBook Pro\" etc) has:\r\n```\r\n\"folderFeatures\": [\r\n\"machineRoot\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese top-level folders have no parents:\r\n```\r\n\"parents\": [],\r\n```\r\n\r\nand all subfolders underneath have:\r\n```\r\n\"folderFeatures\": [\r\n\"arbitrarySyncFolder\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince they all have \"descendantOfRoot\": false, they don't seem to be accessible via any path-based command in this CLI (or I just don't know what root prefix to use).\r\n\r\nWill these folder types be supported so I can create files/subfolders/etc in these \"Computers\" folders?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nWhat is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.38\r\nos/arch: linux/386\r\ngo version: go1.9\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich OS you are using and how

I haven't put the new config flow in - hopefully that will be obvious what is happening.\r\n\r\nAny feedback much appreciated!\r\n\r\n### Scopes ###\r\n\r\nRclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to use.  This changes what type of token is granted to rclone.  [The scopes are defined here](https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/web/about-auth).\r\n\r\nThe scope are\r\n\r\n#### drive ####\r\n\r\nThis is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except for the Application Data Folder (see below).\r\n\r\nChoose this one if you aren't sure.\r\n\r\n#### drive.readonly ####\r\n\r\nThis allows read only access to all files.  Files may be listed and downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.\r\n\r\n#### drive.file ####\r\n\r\nWith this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and folders it creates.\r\n\r\nSo if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other means) they will not be visible to rclone.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.\r\n\r\nFiles created with this scope are visible in the web interface.\r\n\r\n#### drive.appfolder ####\r\n\r\nThis gives rclone its own private area to store files.  Rclone will not be able to see any other files on your drive and you won't be able to see rclone's files from the web interface either.\r\n\r\n#### drive.metadata.readonly ####\r\n\r\nThis allows read only access to file names only.  It does not allow rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete files or directories.\r\n\r\n### Root folder ID ###\r\n\r\nYou can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory that rclone considers to be a the root of your drive.  Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct root to use itself.\r\n\r\nHowever you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder or to access the Backup and Sync \"Computers\" Folders/Files.  In order to do this you will have to find the Folder ID of the folder you wish rclone to display.  This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the folder.  So if the folder/computer backup you want to show looks like `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh` in the browser, then you use `1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh` as the `root_folder_id` in the config.\r\n\r\nThere doesn't appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the \"Computers\" tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/359813082/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/360231317","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1799#issuecomment-360231317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/1799","id":360231317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDIzMTMxNw==","user":{"login":"pedrosimao","id":3837957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzc5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3837957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao","html_url":"https://github.com/pedrosimao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-24T18:37:33Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T18:37:33Z","body":"@ncw This is brilliant.

I have one comment though. I have tried to run the \"moveto\" command to copy a Folder from Gdrive (scope \"drive\", accessible via web interface) to a Folder inside \"drive.appfolder\" scope.

thanks for testing\r\n\r\n>  I have one comment though. I have tried to run the \"moveto\" command to copy a Folder from Gdrive (scope \"drive\", accessible via web interface) to a Folder inside \"drive.appfolder\" scope. And it seems rclone downloads the entire content to my computer and later copy it to the appfolder, unlike it does while moving from inside the same scope, where folder is simply renamed. Do you think it is possible to only use the \"rename\" strategy, instead of copying it all over again?\r\n\r\nI don't know whether Google let you do this.  A bit of experimenting makes me beleive that it isn't possible.  You certainly can't do it with rclone because you need to have a remote which shows both the contents of the appdata folder and the files in drive and that isn't possible with the current drive APIs.  I suspect even if you did manage to do it somehow, the files wouldn't be readable by rclone as they would have the wrong permissions.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/361271397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1446485978,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ0NjQ4NTk3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1446485978","actor":{"login":"pedrosimao","id":3837957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzc5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3837957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao","html_url":"https://github.com/pedrosimao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-29T14:58:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1446485980,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0NDY0ODU5ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1446485980","actor":{"login":"pedrosimao","id":3837957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzc5NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3837957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao","html_url":"https://github.com/pedrosimao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedrosimao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-29T14:58:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1446487478,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ0NjQ4NzQ3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/1446487478","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a4fe2455ed2659708c562c536b8cc92bd2ce8e51","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/a4fe2455ed2659708c562c536b8cc92bd2ce8e51","created_at":"2018-01-29T14:59:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/361272
