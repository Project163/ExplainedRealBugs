:-)\r\n\r\nSo you've got an idea to improve rclone? We love that! You'll be glad to hear we've incorporated hundreds of ideas from contributors already.\r\n\r\nHere is a checklist of things to do:\r\n\r\n  1. Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3. Make a feature request issue (this is the right place!).\r\n  4. Be prepared to get involved making the feature :-)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your great idea!\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nrclone v1.46\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nrclone's \"backblaze\" backend doesn't implement CopyFile. Per #2539, this inhibits the possibility of file and folder renames/moves, specially when using \"rclone mount\"\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nThe \"backend\" should implement the operation using the APIs announced today [Backblaze B2 Copy File Beta is Now Public](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-b2-copy-file-beta-is-now-public/), and in particular to #2539, permit \"Call Copy then Delete on each file if available\" as described in @ncw comment
