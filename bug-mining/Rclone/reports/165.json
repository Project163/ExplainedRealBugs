Out of the 24k or so files 465 consistently are corrupted and thus not transferred. I know that those files are not corrupted on onedrive or my local drive (that uses microsoft's onedrive client to sync files), however those files I am simply unable to sync. I have started out with an empty google drive folder so there are no duplicates.\n\nSee attached log files. The only correlation that I can see is that these files are all small, not more than 100k. On average they are 56k (median 57kb), with minimum size of 67 bytes and max 190kb. It does not matter how many times I retry, these files are consistently corrupted.\n\nfull log file here (10mb, result of -v) http://darkvater.homenet.org/rclone_server_6.txt\n[rclone_server_5.txt](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/files/184439/rclone_server_5.txt)\n\nUpdate: I am doing a test now to just sync onedrive to local and although it hasn't finished yet, I can already see corrupted files. I'll update in the morning, but it could be a onedrive issue instead as these files are correct in the cloud.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
