mentions Glacier Deep Archive. Intelligent-Tiering hasn't been discussed as far as I can tell, but it seems like a no-brainer to support all possible storage classes.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate. (`GLACIER` didn't come with tests so I figured this doesn't need any either, but I tested `DEEP_ARCHIVE` manually since I actually wanted to use it, and it works with these changes.)\r\n- [x] I have
