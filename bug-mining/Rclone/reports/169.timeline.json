spotted @klauspost - excellent sleuthing!\n\nI'm just trying to think through the sequence of events\n- local.Object.Open() is called in fs.Copy()\n- b2.Fs.Update() is called\n- This then calls local.Object.Hash(fs.HashSHA1)\n- This calculates the sha1 and sets it in the object\n- We try the PUT but it is rejected.\n- b2 must reject it without reading the whole stream as we aren't using `Expect: 100-continue`\n- local.Object.Close() is called by fs.Copy() and overwrites the correct hash it with a corrupt hash\n\nSo that indicates that your patch is doing the right thing :-)\n\nIt also indicates that we should probably not overwrite the hash in the local.Object.Close if it is already set.  Actually re-reading your patch I see you've done exactly that
