Right now auth is performed using oauth.\r\n\r\nWhen running services on a headless server, it is more convenient (and often more common) to use an app token, which is generated by hand on the service's website, then saved in scripts/code and included in every REST call to the service.\r\n\r\nBox [has such a feature](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/app-token/). It's typically used in calls made with `curl`, no oauth required.\r\n\r\nIf implemented, it would greatly simplify configuration in headless environments.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, it is quite possible many other storage services also support this auth option.)","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4114/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
