Please search the old issues first for your idea and +1 or comment on an existing issue if possible.\r\n  2. Discuss on the forum first: https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n  3.

I am using the rclone mounted Box: storage in conjunction with mergerfs. The other merged storage is 4shared.com. Firstly the data was written to Box: storage and the drive was fully written, no space has left.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\n Without the ability to check the available free space on the mounted storage, mergerfs has no chance to send the data to the other merged drive when this would be needed. Google drive and Yandex both supports the rclone about command, mergerfs worked with them perfectly. Adding rclone about Box: support would solve my problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
