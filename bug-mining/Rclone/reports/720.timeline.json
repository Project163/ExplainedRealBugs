thank you for your kind offer. I think I won't do the notarizing for the moment - I'd like to let the situation settle down at bit.\r\n\r\nI think what we should do now put a note into the [install doc](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/docs/content/install.md#macos-installation-from-precompiled-binary) to the effect that macOS Catalina can't run rclone binaries by default and specify the `xattr` workaround provided it works OK.  Maybe another section on `brew install rclone`. I don't know who packages rclone for brew so I'm a bit nervous recommending it there, but it seems bang up to date.\r\n\r\nWould one of you kind macOS users like to send a PR updating the docs to that effect?\r\n\r\nI can then push that to the website as part of a patch release.\r\n\r\nPerhaps adding the `xattr` fix to [install.sh](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/docs/content/install.sh) would be OK too?\r\n\r\nCan a macOS Catalina user test the `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine` fix to see if it actually

What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nExplain how to workaround the problems due to macOS Gatekeeper requiring an executable to be notarized.\r\n\r\nWith reference to @ncw requests in #3689:\r\n\r\n> I think what we should do now put a note into the install doc to the effect that macOS Catalina can't run rclone binaries by default and specify the xattr workaround provided it works OK.\r\n\r\nDone. I also mentioned the `xattr` workaround, although I am not even sure it makes sense to mention, since it is needed only when downloading the package with a web browser. Please have a look at the details in the PR.\r\n\r\n> Maybe another section on brew install rclone. I don't know who packages rclone for brew so I'm a bit nervous recommending it there, but it seems bang up to date.\r\n\r\nI added a new section, and actually put it as the first macOS section given the simplicity. Let me know if you want me to change.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps adding the xattr fix to install.sh would be OK too?\r\n\r\nI tested with `install.sh` and the workaround is not needed: `rclone` works fine. It turns out that it is really the web browser that sets the quarantine attribute :-D (More details at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21179970)\r\n\r\n> Can a macOS Catalina user test the xattr -d com.apple.quarantine fix to see if it actually works\r\n\r\nI tested downloading the package and the `xattr` workaround works.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n1. `install.sh` works out of the box.\r\n2. `brew install rclone` works out of the box.\r\n3. if downloading with a web browser, the `xattr` workaround works.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nFixes #3689\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [X] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [X] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [X] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2831739453,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjgzMTczOTQ1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2831739453","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-26T12:33:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2831739555,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI4MzE3Mzk1NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2831739555","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d72f3e31c0a82bf49079a40f5b933096a7498d1d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/commits/d72f3e31c0a82bf49079a40f5b933096a7498d1d","created_at":"2019-11-26T12:33:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
