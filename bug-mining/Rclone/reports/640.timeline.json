If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the changes here\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo run rclone in \"portable\" mode, as in \"portable app\", by putting rclone.exe together with rclone.conf in a folder on a memory stick. Rclone will pick up the local config file without having to always remember to specify the --config command line argument, and not having to resort to launcher script like described in [forum](https://forum.rclone.org/t/how-to-change-the-path-to-the-config-file-rclone-cong-permanently/10324/5).\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLink issues and relevant forum posts here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe idea came from [this](https://forum.rclone.org/t/how-to-change-the-path-to-the-config-file-rclone-cong-permanently/10324/5) forum post, although it does not describe the solution itself. \r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in
