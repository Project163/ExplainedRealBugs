The command will be available in the beta builds for a limited circle of beta testers until official release with rclone v1.58.\r\nDuring the beta period we can merge a number of postponed items, **in particular breaking changes**.\r\n\r\nThis ticket will keep track of the most beta time changes. Large and critical changes will be split into separate tickets.\nHigh priority items reflect changes breaking user experience and must be completed before 1.58. Medium priority items are required but not guaranteed by 1.58. Optional and low priority items will be implemented on best effort basis. Optional items don't even have dedicated tickets yet.\r\n\r\n### High priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Track critical flags in saved sessions - #5678\r\n- [ ] Support imprecise or absent modtimes - #5679\r\n- [ ] Use hashsums, honor `--checksum` - #5683\r\n\r\n### Medium priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Check file sizes - #5684\r\n- [ ] Respect `--backup-dir` - #5685\r\n- [ ] Align `--max-delete` semantics - #5680\r\n- [ ] Optimize resync - #5681\r\n- [ ] Track renames - #5690\r\n\r\n### Low priority\r\n\r\n- [ ] Handle deletion conflicts - #5691\r\n- [ ] Honor `--interactive` and `--auto-confirm`\r\n- [ ] Recover after transient failures - #5676\r\n- [ ] Use **trie** for listings to reduce footprint - #5686\r\n- [ ] Maintain session history - #5692\r\n- [ ] Handle Google Docs better - #5696\r\n\r\n### Optional items\r\n\r\n- [ ] Parallelize move/rename operations\r\n- [ ] Honor special `.rcignore` files\r\n- [ ] Revisit progress display for bisync\r\n- [ ] Handle case-insensitive filenames.

Is anybody planning to work on this soon, or is it a low priority? Is there anything I can help with, without speaking Go? As far as I see, compared to a unidirectional sync, this would require keeping a full listing of the last known synced state, in order to figure out *where* a rename took place.\r\n\r\nFor context, my use case would be keeping a directory on my phone in sync with a NextCloud server, where files can be added, deleted and renamed/moved on both ends. My options seem to be a) finding a software solution that supports this, b) renting a (twice as expensive) server I can run Syncthing on, c) writing a Python script myself. Rclone seems to be close to a), hence I'm curious. By no means I intend to beg anyone to implement this feature sooner!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1272320348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"f0k","id":629706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTcwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/629706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k","html_url":"https://github.com/f0k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-02T19:38:37Z","updated_at":"2023-07-02T19:38:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/6971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/6971","id":1680053926,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAQ-n5M5O8LGX","number":6971,"title":"bisync:

Files and folders can now be renamed on both sides without needing to re-upload, or do a `--resync`, or end up with erroneous `..path1` and `..path2` versions. (However, the behavior is unchanged when a rename is on only one side.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1632301741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9797919001,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M483_DJzwAAAAJIAGEZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/9797919001","actor":{"login":"f0k","id":629706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTcwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/629706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k","html_url":"https://github.com/f0k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-07-12T11:07:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9797919018,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M483_DJzwAAAAJIAGEq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/9797919018","actor":{"login":"f0k","id":629706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTcwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/629706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k","html_url":"https://github.com/f0k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-07-12T11:07:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/1632691687","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5690#issuecomment-1632691687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5690","id":1632691687,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M5hUOXn","user":{"login":"f0k","id":629706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTcwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/629706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k","html_url":"https://github.com/f0k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-12T14:54:27Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T14:54:27Z","body":"Nice!

However, if I understand correctly, this does not help when a file is renamed only on one side and I would like the change to propagate to the other side without incurring a retransmission.\r\n\r\nYou are correct.\r\n\r\nAs a note to anyone revisiting this later (possibly me), I think the technical limitation currently is that `--track-renames` doesn't work with `copy`, only `sync`. Whereas `bisync` uses `copy` to transfer the queued files to the opposite path, and then it does the queued deletes in a later step. Here's the line where it calls `CopyDir`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/415f4b2b93cd39799818cc87349510d8f4f32fa1/cmd/bisync/queue.go#L26-L26\r\n\r\nwhich then calls `runSyncCopyMove` with `fs.DeleteModeOff` hard-coded:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/415f4b2b93cd39799818cc87349510d8f4f32fa1/fs/sync/sync.go#L1141-L1144\r\n\r\n`fs.DeleteModeOff` precludes `--track-renames`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/415f4b2b93cd39799818cc87349510d8f4f32fa1/fs/sync/sync.go#L208-L211\r\n\r\nI think it should be possible (and desirable) to support `--track-renames` for `bisync`, but it would take a bit of rethinking about how `bisync` queues work.

this is likely when resync is run when data is already present vs copying the data itself.. There are no changes made to files when moving between a --resync and normal run.  \r\n\r\ndefaults:\r\n\tresync: 10m47.0s\r\n\tnormal: 6m44.7s\r\n\r\ndefaults with ignore checksum: (--ignore-listing-checksum --ignore-checksum)\r\n\tresync: 10m36.5s\r\n\tnormal: 6m31.9s\r\n\r\n### overview\r\n\r\nSo as you can see bisync is orders of magnitude slower than `copy` or `sync` . `ls` is incredibly fast as is `sync` and `copy` in both directions (e.g. uses up almost 100% of bandwidth)\r\n\r\nI only ran the test of `lsl` and `ls` at the very end and now thinking that bisync relies on lsl as this so incredibly slow (as I believe bisync does not use checksum so would need `lsl` info to compare?).\r\n\r\nI can do a local to crypt (local) bisync in 15s (--resync) and 8.7s for subsequent. \r\n\r\nIs there something I am doing wrong? If not, are there plans/options available to rclone to improve the speed of bisync so that it is more in line with 2 x sync/copy commands (e.g. one upload, one download) or is this a limitation that is unlikely to be overcome? Also, if this is due to lsl taking so long is there a way to speed up lsl? \r\n\r\nThanks to you all for your hard work and a special thank you @nielash for all you've been doing on bisync and continue to do. I as many others massively appreciate it and when this tool is out of experimental stages it will be a game changer for so many. If I had any free time or money right now I would help out but unfortunately the best I can do is give you some benchmarks and user feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks
