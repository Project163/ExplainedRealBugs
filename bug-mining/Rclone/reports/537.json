Mostly it works fine, but it seems to choke on individual files bigger than 10GB or so. There’s no explicit error (that I saw), it just tries to upload them over and over. It gets to the end, looks like it worked, then starts again.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there was originally a problem with large files with the WebDav mode on OpenDrive, but this is using the new OpenDrive mode in 1.42, with encryption if it matters.\r\n\r\nThe chance of failure seems to increase with size. Files just slightly larger than 10GB worked eventually, but if it’s much more than that (one file I’m testing with is about 15GB), I haven’t been able to get it to upload cleanly.\r\n\r\nAccording to OpenDrive, there are no file size limits for their service, so at least theoretically this should work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal forum thread here:\r\nhttps://forum.rclone.org/t/opendrive-inconsistently-failing-on-files-10gb/6473\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.42\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.10.3\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nArch Linux 64-bit\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?

Same result either way though.)\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nRelevant bit as determined by ncw:\r\n\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:08 DEBUG : <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:08 DEBUG : encryptedXXXX: Uploading chunk 1632, size=10485760, remain=14566075\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:08 DEBUG : >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:08 DEBUG : HTTP REQUEST (req 0xc420100200)\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:08 DEBUG : POST /api/v1/upload/upload_file_chunk.json HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: dev.opendrive.com\r\nUser-Agent: rclone/v1.42\r\nContent-Length: 10487308\r\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=e6009437e443da64c4cc7bcad81ceb2826c39d8cf2fe7c575e69854af8ae\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\r\n\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:08 DEBUG : >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:11 INFO  : \r\nTransferred:   159.605 GBytes (1.464 MBytes/s)\r\nErrors:                 0\r\nChecks:                 1\r\nTransferred:            0\r\nElapsed time:   31h1m1.1s\r\nTransferring:\r\n *   ...XXX: 100% /15.957G, 1.071M/s, 0s\r\n\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:17 DEBUG : <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:17 DEBUG : HTTP RESPONSE (req 0xc420100200)\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:17 DEBUG : HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\nCache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nContent-Language: en\r\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\r\nDate: Thu, 16 Aug 2018 19:30:17 GMT\r\nExpires: 0\r\nLast-Modified: Thu, 16 Aug 2018 19:30:17 GMT\r\nServer: nginx\r\nServerid: s7\r\nX-Powered-By: OpenDrive.com\r\n\r\n19\r\n{\"TotalWritten\":10485760}\r\n0\r\n\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:17 DEBUG : <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:17 DEBUG : encryptedXXXX: Uploading chunk 1633, size=10485760, remain=4080315\r\n2018/08/16 14:30:17 ERROR : XXX: Failed to copy: failed to create file: EOF","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
