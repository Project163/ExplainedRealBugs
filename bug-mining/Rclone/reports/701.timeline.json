I do sanity check with the two commands below. Both work fine.\r\n\r\nThanks for testing :-)\r\n\r\n> A quick question. I see not all functions in fs/config/flags/flags.go have been changed. For example, `BoolVarP()` is changed, but `BoolP()` isn't. I assume that's OK because the later isn't used in rclone code, right?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see all the flags defined in `fs/config/flags/flags.go` call `setDefaultFromEnv` so should all be working now.\r\n\r\nI've merged this to master now which means it will be in [the latest beta](https://beta.rclone.org) in 15-30 mins and released in v1.50\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are all changed now - maybe you don't have the ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/541768686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
