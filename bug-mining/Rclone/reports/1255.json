But the search in their API works with names of up to 50 ASCII characters and 25 UTF-16 characters (for example, Cyrillic) only. Thus, normal operation is possible only with very short names. For example, using base32 encoding for names, the maximum name length can be only 8 UTF-16 characters, and for base32768 - 16 UTF-16 characters. Which is, of course, very little in real life.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\nrclone v1.65.0 and rclone v1.66.0-beta.7594.5fa13e3e3\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nArch Linux 64 bit\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using?
