for those blurbs. I've made that change in https://github.com/squircle/rclone/commit/ef0ea13022f3378fb12efa785dc1143aab998240 and done the following testing:\r\n* macOS IPv4: working ✅\r\n* macOS IPv6: working ✅\r\n* openSUSE Tumbleweed IPv4: working ✅\r\n* openSUSE Tumbleweed IPv6: working ✅\r\n* Windows 10 20H2 IPv4: fails silently ❌\r\n* Windows 10 20H2 IPv6: crashes with \"not implemented\" error ❌\r\n\r\nIt's lucky that DSCP wasn't working at all on previous releases, because it's totally broken on Windows. Based on https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42728 it seems that Microsoft only supports setting DSCP through a proprietary Windows QoS API and not through socket options. For that reason, I'm going to update `dialer.go` (and the related documentation) to skip DSCP handling on Windows platforms. I'll make it easy to refactor if the golang packages add support for this API (or if somebody else wants to implement this).\r\n\r\nI'll send a PR with the whole set of changes once I'm done.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/830976612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"squircle","id":1480823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODA4MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle","html_url":"https://github.com/squircle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squircle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/831029764","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5293#issuecomment-831029764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5293","id":831029764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTAyOTc2NA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-03T05:32:02Z","updated_at":"2021-05-03T05:32:02Z","body":"Great
