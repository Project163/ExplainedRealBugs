The documentation also mentions `source:sourcePath` in other cases in which case this behavior seems a bit misleading?\r\n\r\nI will add a comment to the issue that you linked, thanks a lot. Feel free to close this issue if you see this as expected behavior.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/629636802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fspoettel","id":1682504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1682504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel","html_url":"https://github.com/fspoettel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3343540473,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM0MzU0MDQ3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3343540473","actor":{"login":"animosity022","id":5088712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODg3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5088712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022","html_url":"https://github.com/animosity022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-16T12:17:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3343540474,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNDM1NDA0NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/3343540474","actor":{"login":"animosity022","id":5088712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODg3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5088712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022","html_url":"https://github.com/animosity022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-16T12:17:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/629637087","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4239#issuecomment-629637087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4239","id":629637087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTYzNzA4Nw==","user":{"login":"animosity022","id":5088712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODg3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5088712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022","html_url":"https://github.com/animosity022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/animosity022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_

It is mentioned that a _remote_ can be a local path [here](https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths) and in detail [here](https://rclone.org/local/). The [purge](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/) command takes the argument `remote:path` so I guess this whole thing is mentioned in the docs in some way.\r\n2. However, `rclone` lets you configure explicit _remotes_ with `config`. As a user, I now made the assumption that `rclone` would as least warn me when I try to `rm -rf` a directory that is not configured as an explicit remote. That is obviously not the case.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to warn when purge is called with what amounts to an empty argument? I would argue that deleting the local $CWD with `rclone purge` is almost always user error and should involve a safeguard of some sort.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/629641256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fspoettel","id":1682504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1682504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel","html_url":"https://github.com/fspoettel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fspoettel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/629642126","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4239#issuecomment-629642126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4239","id":629642126,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTY0MjEyNg==","user":{"login":"calisro","id":5018276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTgyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5018276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro","html_url":"https://github.com/calisro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calisro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-16T13:00:16Z","updated_at":"2020-05-16T13:00:16Z","body":"The empty argument probably shouldn't happen.
