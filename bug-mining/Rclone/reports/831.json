Everything works great thus far, however use of the script currently requires  the end user to store plaintext Dropbox credentials on there machines as part of the Dropbox Remote entry in the user's Rclone config file (`~/.conf/rclone/rclone.conf`).\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\nI'd like to add a `--dropbox-credentials` flag so that a user is able to supply an inline JSON blob in order to fully automate authentication to Dropbox. It would work just like Drive's `--drive-service-account-credentials` flag. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`--dropbox-client-id \"CLIENT_ID\"`\r\n`--dropbox-client-secret \"CLIENT_SECRET\"`\r\n**`--dropbox-credentials '{\"access_token\": \"SUPER_SECRET_OAUTH\", \"token_type\":\"bearer\", \"expiry\":\"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z\"}'`**\r\n\r\n#### Do you have the time/ability to work on this feature request yourself?\r\nYes I should have time to poke at this over the holiday, but I might need a bit more golang advice- my only golang exp thus far has been the implementation of issue #2577. Worst case scenario I can work on this Q1 2019.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts. I'm excited to poke more at this codebase and get greater exposure to golang :)\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\n-Jake\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2849/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/2849/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
