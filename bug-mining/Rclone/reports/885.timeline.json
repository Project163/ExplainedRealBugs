What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nAn invocation which includes a trailing `/.` on the target path (as is often done by long-time Unix users) causes an entry to be created in dropbox named \".\".\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone copy somefile dropbox:somedir/.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA user might reasonably expect `somedir/.` to be interpreted the same as `somedir`, like it is for all other Unix-like tools. e.g. with `cp` or `scp`, adding `/.` to the end of the target dir will cause the copy to fail if the target dir doesn't exist, rather than copying the target file to a *file* named `somedir`.\r\n\r\nInstead the target gets a directory named \".\" and `somefile` copied into it.\r\n\r\n\".\" is not a legal name for a directory on any known non-cloud storage, as it's reserved for \"current directory.\"\r\n\r\n**My proposal is** that rclone silently lop off any trailing \"/.\" from the name, as the intent of adding \"/.\", as its interpreted by every other tool, is exactly what rclone already does without the \"/.\". Because \".\" is (outside of cloud storage) not a legal directory name, it seems highly unlikely that anyone actually relies on the current behaviour.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.53.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/arm\r\n- go version: go1.15\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi OS 10\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nDropBox and Google Drive both exhibit this.\r\n\r\nThe DropBox web UI will not allow one to create a directory with this name, but GDrive's web UI does.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone copy somefile dropbox:somedir/.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rclone -vv copy conversion.txt gdrive:xfer/.\r\n2020/12/16 11:39:17 DEBUG : rclone: Version \"v1.53.1\" starting with parameters [\"rclone\" \"-vv\"
