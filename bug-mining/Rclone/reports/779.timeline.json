I agree..\r\n\r\nHere is my proposal which I [posted in the forum](https://forum.rclone.org/t/proposal-for-backwards-incompatible-change-to-files-from/13111)\r\n\r\nCurrently `--files-from` parses the input files in the same way that `--include-from` does, namely it\r\n- ignores comments starting with `#` and `;`\r\n- strips whitespace from start and end of strings\r\n\r\nThis makes `--files-from` less useful that it might be and was never the original intention.\r\n\r\nI propose to make the backwards incompatible change so that `--files-from` reads every line from the file ignoring comment characters and not stripping whitespace.\r\n\r\nThis will restore the expected behaviour that `rclone lsf` is good input to `--files-from` when files have leading spaces, `;` or `#`.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact of this is minimal I think as most `--files-from` lists are auto generated.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/559063035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2835426127,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4MzU0MjYxMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2835426127","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-27T12:15:14Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2835426130,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4MzU0MjYxMzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2835426130","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-27T12:15:14Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2835426419,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjgzNTQyNjQxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2835426419","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-27T12:15:20Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2835426632,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDI4MzU0MjY2MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2835426632","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserconten
