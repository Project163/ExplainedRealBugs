Example: we have 5 mega.io accounts of 20GB, 3 Google Drive accounts of 15GB... they can combine them into (5 x 20GB) + (3 x 15GB) ~ 145GB of \"crypt\" drive space.\r\nWhen uploading a file to a \"virtual\" crypt drive, it will divide the file into files for example 1MB, 10MB... written to \"real\" drives (5 mega.io accounts of 20GB, 3 accounts). Google Drive account 15GB...)\r\nWhen the user needs to download, rclone will download small files (eg 1MB, 10MB...) that have been divided and encrypted, then reassemble and create the original file.\r\nI think it's possible, it's pretty magical, it looks like we're creating a universe inside the little free storage packages of the storage providers.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your feature request. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
