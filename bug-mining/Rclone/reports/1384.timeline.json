PR Summary\n\nLogging Enhancements, String Transformations, and Bug Fixes\n\n## Overview\n\nThis PR adds comprehensive logging capabilities to multiple commands, introduces new file name transformation options, fixes several bugs, and improves overall code quality with optimizations and refactoring.\n\n## Change Types\n\n| Type         | Description                            |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Enhancement  | Added comprehensive logging functionality to copy, copyto, move, and moveto commands |\n| Feature      | Added new string truncation transformations with extension preservation |\n| Bugfix       | Fixed filesystem path handling, Windows junction points, and Unicode normalization |\n| Refactor     | Improved logging implementation and code structure |\n| Optimization | Added early-return optimizations for identical paths |\n\n---\n\n## Affected Modules\n\n| Module / File                       | Change Description                       |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| `combine/combine.go`               | Fixed bug in path handling for upstream filesystem |\n| `local/local.go`                   | Added Windows Junction point support as symlinks |\n| `copy/copy.go`, `copyto/copyto.go` | Added logging functionality with context handling |\n| `move/move.go`, `moveto/moveto.go` | Added logging functionality with context handling |\n| `operations/logger.go`             | Added new DefaultLoggerFn implementation |\n| `operations/operations.go`         | Improved move operations logging and Unicode handling |\n| `operations/operationsflags/operationsflags.go` | Added logger configuration helpers |\n| `sync/sync.go`                     | Refactored logging and added optimization |\n| `transform/transform.go`           | Added new string truncation functions |\n| `log/systemd_unix.go`              | Improved systemd logging implementation |\n| `convmv/convmv_test.go`            | Added Unicode normalization testing |\n\n## Notes for Reviewers\n\n* The new logging system uses a centralized configuration approach with the operationsflags package\n* Unicode normalization is now checked in path comparisons to detect equivalent strings with different representations\n* New string transformation options focus on truncation with extension

PR Summary\n\nEnhanced Logging, Windows Junction Support, and String Transformation Improvements\n\n## Overview\n\nThis PR adds structured logging functionality to multiple commands, improves Windows junction point handling, enhances the Mega backend with TLS compatibility, and adds new string transformation options for handling multi-byte characters.\n\n## Change Types\n\n| Type         | Description                            |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Enhancement  | Added structured logging to copy, copyto, move, moveto commands |\n| Enhancement  | Added new string transformation options for truncation with UTF-8 support |\n| Bugfix       | Fixed Windows junction point handling by treating os.ModeIrregular as symlinks |\n| Enhancement  | Added TLS compatibility for Mega storage endpoints |\n| Refactor     | Standardized logging implementation across commands |\n| Bugfix       | Fixed parameter consistency in combine.go |\n| Documentation| Corrected comments and improved help text in multiple files |\n\n---\n\n## Affected Modules\n\n| Module / File          | Change Description                       |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| `combine/combine.go`   | Fixed parameter consistency in listP call |\n| `local/local.go`       | Added Windows junction point handling     |\n| `mega/mega.go`         | Added TLS compatibility for Mega endpoints |\n| `copy/copy.go`         | Added structured logging functionality    |\n| `copyto/copyto.go`     | Added structured logging and context management |\n| `move/move.go`         | Added structured logging and context management |\n| `moveto/moveto.go`     | Added structured logging and context management |\n| `sync/sync.go`         | Refactored logging implementation and added optimization |\n| `log/systemd_unix.go`  | Improved systemd logging implementation   |\n| `operations/logger.go` | Added NewDefaultLoggerFn function         |\n| `operations/operations.go` | Enhanced move operation messages and optimizations |\n| `operations/operationsflags/operationsflags.go` | Added logger configuration utilities |\n| `transform/transform.go` | Added new string truncation functions with UTF-8 support |\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Reviewers\n\n* The logging changes standardize how logging is implemented across commands\n* The Windows junction point handling may need testing on Windows systems\n* The Mega TLS compatibility adds support for older cipher suites\n* The string transformation changes handle multi-byte characters properly\n\n---\n\n## Additional Context\n\n* The systemd logging implementation now uses native journal.Print approach\n* Early return optimizations were added to avoid unnecessary operations during dry runs\n* New string transformation options include truncate_keep_extension, truncate_bytes, and truncate_bytes_keep_extension","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeOwlAI/rclone/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeOwlAI/rclone/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
