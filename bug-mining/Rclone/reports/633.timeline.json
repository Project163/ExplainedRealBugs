The operation\r\n>        is supported on at least the following filesystems:\r\n> \r\n>        *  XFS (since Linux 2.6.\r\n>        *  ext4 (since Linux 3.0)\r\n>        *  Btrfs (since Linux 3.7)\r\n>        *  tmpfs(5) (since Linux 3.5)\"\r\n\r\nPre allocate is a performance optimization only, it doesn't affect correctness.  I added to speed up Windows where it is very effective, the Linux support was an afterthought.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best solution might be for rclone to detect the \"operation not supported\" error (syscall.ENOTSUP) and turn off pre allocate?\r\n\r\nOr I guess it could try `FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE | FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE` and if that failed turn it off.\r\n\r\nI had a go at that here - can you give it a go?  It should print some log messages which I'll remove once it is working.\r\n\r\nhttps://beta.rclone.org/branch/v1.46.0-108-g88b893d1-fix-3066-preallocate-beta/ (uploaded in 15-30

This flag tells falloc to maintain the size of the file, which is the opposite of pre*allocating*\n\nA rough fix below seems to work\n```diff\ndiff --git a/lib/file/preallocate_unix.go b/lib/file/preallocate_unix.go\nindex dc05fc60e..f3a7511d9 100644\n--- a/lib/file/preallocate_unix.go\n+++ b/lib/file/preallocate_unix.go\n@@ -14,8 +14,8 @@ import (\n \n var (\n \tfallocFlags = [...]uint32{\n-\t\tunix.FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE,                             // Default\n-\t\tunix.FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE | unix.FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, // for ZFS #3066\n+\t\t0,                             // Default\n+\t\tunix.FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, // for ZFS #3066\n \t}\n```\n\nHowever, the second set of flags will not work as FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE is required to be OR'd with FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE according to [the manual](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html). Additionally, I propose that we look into using ftruncate if the user allows us to use sparse files.\n\n\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n\n#### How to use GitHub\n\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
