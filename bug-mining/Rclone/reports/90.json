created [Yandex Disk](https://disk.yandex.com/) cloud storage backend for rclone.\n\nAlready working:\n- rclone opetations: copy, sync, ls, lsl(size, md5, modificationTime)\n- uploading/downloading/removing/listing files\n- creating directories\n\nI've tested syncronization and copying to and from the cloud a bit\n\nNot working yet:\n- lsd operation (will add later)\n- empty folders not created/removed yet\n\nNeeded:\n- no documentation yet\n- not everything is covered with unit tests\n- maybe api part need some refactoring\n\nI will cleanup code and posting it a bit later.\n\nIf you're interested, I think you need to register oAuth app with Yandex Disk https://tech.yandex.com/oauth/  for rClone.\n\nAs of today I think Yandex Disk offering somwhere about 10Gb for free.
