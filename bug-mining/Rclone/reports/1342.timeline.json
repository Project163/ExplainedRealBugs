those that come later wanting to do this, here are the steps that worked for me:\r\n\r\n1. In [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com), open each user you need to \"impersonate\" and go to the OneDrive section. There is a heading called \"Get access to files\", you need to click to create the link, this creates the link of the format `https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/personal/{user_name_domain_tld}/` but also does something in the backend to give you permission\r\n2. Then in powershell run the following commands:\r\n```console\r\nInstall-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force\r\nImport-Module Microsoft.Graph.Files\r\nConnect-MgGraph -Scopes \"Files.ReadWrite.All\"\r\n# Follow the steps to allow access to your admin user\r\n# Then run this for each user you want to impersonate to get the Drive ID\r\nGet-MgUserDefaultDrive -UserId '{emailaddress}'\r\n# This will give you output of the format:\r\n# Name     Id                                                                 DriveType CreatedDateTime\r\n# ----     --                                                                 --------- ---------------\r\n# OneDrive b!XYZ123                                                           business  14/10/2023 1:00:58 pm\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Then in rclone add a onedrive remote type, and use the `Type in driveID` with the DriveID you got in the previous step. One remote per user. It will then confirm the drive ID, and hopefully give you a message of `Found drive \"root\" of type \"business\"` and then include the URL of the format `https://{tenant}-my.sharepoint.com/personal/{user_name_domain_tld}/Documents`\r\n\r\n(Yes, I should probably update the OneDrive docs, but that requires a bit more effort than dumping my working commands here, I'll try to come back later after this project to write up nice docs)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2579129840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"timwsuqld","id":6201617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDE2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6201617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld","html_url":"https://github.com/timwsuqld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timwsuqld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/2579931939","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5610#issuecomment-2579931939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/5610","id":2579931939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M6ZxqMj","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-09T11:35:40Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T11:35:40Z","body":"@timwsuqld appreciate the writeup - thank you  :-)\r\n\r\nIf you want to add it to the docs you can do it in your browser from here (click the pencil icon to edit): https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/docs/content/onedrive.md it is in markdown so your comment above will cut and paste into the docs!
