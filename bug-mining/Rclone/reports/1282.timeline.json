The associated forum post URL from `https://forum.rclone.org`\r\n\r\nNot applicable at the moment\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nFiles being uploaded to Dropbox with the character `＼` end up as files having `‛＼` in the Web UI and in the Desktop Windows app. Trying to access the files with original filename (i.e. only with `＼`, not `‛＼` fails) with rclone commands (e.g. `ls`).\r\nThis is probably an issue with encoding, as I've managed to remove the `‛` (using the Dropbox Web interface and Windows Dropbox desktop app) and setting `encoding = None` in the config file, and this allows for access (at least via `ls`) to the original filename.\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nv1.67.0\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (e.g. Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nWindows 10, 64 bit.  Also applies to Debian 11.0, 64 bit. \r\n\r\n#### Which cloud storage system are you using? (e.g. Google Drive)\r\n\r\nDropbox\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (e.g. `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nFiles with the special `＼` are created with `rclone moveto`, I did confirmation with `rclone ls` to access files. \r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (e.g. output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nDoesn't provide useful information from what I can tell. Also unclear which command to log.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\r\n\r\n#### How to use GitHub\r\n\r\n* Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\r\n* Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
