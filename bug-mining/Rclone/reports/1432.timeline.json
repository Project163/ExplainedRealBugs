using external SSH binaries via `--sftp-ssh`, zombie processes accumulate because `sshClientExternal.Wait()` is never actually called. The root cause was that `sshClientExternal.session` was never assigned in `NewSession()`, so `Wait()` always returned `nil` immediately without waiting for the SSH process to exit.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **Store the first session**: Modified `NewSession()` to assign the created session to `s.session` so `Wait()` can actually wait for the SSH process\n- **Use `sync.Once`**: Added `sync.Once` in `sshSessionExternal.Wait()` to ensure `cmd.Wait()` executes exactly once (thread-safety)\n- **Store and return wait result**: Added `waitErr` field to store and return the wait result on subsequent calls\n- **Add tests**: Added tests verifying multiple `Wait()` calls don't cause process leaks\n\n```go\n// In sshClientExternal\nfunc (s *sshClientExternal) NewSession() (sshSession, error) {\n\tsession := s.f.newSSHSessionExternal()\n\tif s.session == nil {\n\t\t// Store the first session so Wait() and Close() can use it\n\t\ts.session = session\n\t} else {\n\t\tfs.Debugf(s.f, \"ssh external: creating additional session\")\n\t}\n\treturn session, nil\n}\n\n// In sshSessionExternal\ntype sshSessionExternal struct {\n    // ... existing fields\n    waitOnce    sync.Once\n    waitErr     error\n}\n\nfunc (s *sshSessionExternal) Wait() error {\n    s.waitOnce.Do(func() {\n        s.waitErr = s.cmd.Wait()\n        // ... logging\n    })\n    return s.waitErr\n}\n```\n\nFixes rclone/rclone#8929\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>sftp: zombie ssh processes with --sftp-ssh</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>The integration tests show that when using SFTP with `--sftp-ssh` lots of zombie processes are left behind.\n> \n> Not sure if this is integration test specific but it needs investigating.\n> \n> ```console\n>  848174 pts/30   Sl+    0:01  |   \\_ go run ./fstest/test_all -backends sftp\n>  848254 pts/30   Sl+    0:00  |       \\_ /tmp/go-build842052937/b001/exe/test_all -backends sftp\n>  849546 pts/30   Sl+    0:00  |           \\_ ./sync.test -test.v -test.timeout 1h0m0s -remote TestSFTPRcloneSSH:\n>  849756 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n>  850029 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n>  850068 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n>  851789 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n>  852312 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n>  852321 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n>  852577 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n>  852722 pts/30   Z+     0:00  |           |   \\_ [ssh] <defunct>\n> ```\n> \n> <!--- Please keep the note below for others who read your bug report. -->\n> \n> #### How to use GitHub\n> \n> * Please use the 👍 [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to show that you are affected by the same issue.\n> * Please don't comment if you have no relevant information to add.
