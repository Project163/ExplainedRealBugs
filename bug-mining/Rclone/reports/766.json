This is a regression from rclone v1.48.\r\n\r\n*rclone v1.48 behavior:*\r\n```\r\n$ rclone mount mycontainer: myfolder/ &\r\n$ ls myfolder\r\nmyfile1  myfile2 \r\n```\r\n\r\n*rclone v1.51 behavior:*\r\n```\r\n$ rclone mount mycontainer: myfolder/ &\r\n$ ls myfolder\r\nmycontainer\r\n$ ls myfolder/mycontainer\r\nmyfile1  myfile2\r\n```\r\n\r\n*cat rclone.conf:*\r\n```\r\n[mycontainer]\r\ntype = azureblob\r\nsas_url = https://someaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?st=...&se=...&sig=...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.51.0\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.13.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nUbuntu 16.04 64 bit\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\nMicrosoft Azure Blob Storage\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n`rclone mount my-container: myfolder/`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A log from the command with the `-vv` flag (eg output from `rclone -vv copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/4028/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
