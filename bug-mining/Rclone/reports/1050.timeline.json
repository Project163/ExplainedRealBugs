What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nFrom commit messages:\r\n\r\n1. A strange feature (probably bug) in the api used by the server-side copy implementation in Jottacloud backend is that if the destination file is in trash, the copy request succeeds but the destination will still be in trash! When this situation occurs in rclone, the copy command will fail with \"Failed to copy: object not found\" because rclone verifies that the file info in the response from the copy request is valid, and since it is marked as deleted it is treated as invalid. This PR works around this problem by looking for this situation in the response from the copy operation, and send an additional request to a built-in deduplication endpoint that will restore the file from trash.\r\n\r\n2. Now using the utility function for deduplication that was newly implemented to fix an issue with server-side copy. This function uses the original, and generic, \"jfs\" api (and its \"cphash\" feature), instead of the newer \"allocate\" api dedicated\r\nfor uploads. Both apis support similar deduplication functionaly that we rely on for the SetModTime operation. One advantage of using the jfs variant is that the allocate api is specialized for uploads, an initial request performs modtime-only changes and deduplication if possible but if not possible it creates an incomplete file revision and returns a special url to be used with a following request to upload missing content. In the SetModTime function we only sent the first request, using metadata from existing remote file but different timestamps, which lead to a modtime-only change. If, for some reason, this should fail it would leave the incomplete revision behind. Probably not a problem, but the jfs implementation used with this commit is simpler and a more \"standalone\" request which either succeeds or fails without expecting additional requests.\r\n\r\n####
