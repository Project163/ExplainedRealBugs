Mac](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38485#issuecomment-730247329). \r\n\r\nFrom your Intel Mac, compile Golang:\r\n```\r\nIntel-Mac $ git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go goroot\r\nIntel-Mac $ GOARCH=arm64 GOOS=darwin ./bootstrap.bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then install the generated tarball on your M1, and make sure to sign them:\r\n\r\n```\r\nM1-Mac $ codesign -s - /opt/go/bin/*\r\nM1-Mac $

`rclone` as per the [wiki](https://rclone.org/install/#install-from-source):\r\n\r\n```\r\nM1-Mac $ go get github.com/rclone/rclone@master \r\nM1-Mac $ go build  \r\nM1-Mac $ file rclone\r\nrclone: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64\r\n```\r\n\r\n@ncw should this command be failing?\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake tarball\r\ngit archive -9 --format=tar.gz --prefix=rclone-v1.54.0-beta.4958.1efb8ea28/ -o
