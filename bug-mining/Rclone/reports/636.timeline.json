point @ncw !! \r\n\r\ntoo many variable I guess...\r\n\r\nI decided to setup cache due to below message repeatedly showed:\r\n`webdav root 'Test/newapproach': Target remote doesn't support streaming uploads, creating temporary local FS to spool file`\r\n\r\nThere is something I have noticed that makes a lot of improvement (mounting OpenDrive for instance)\r\n `   --write-back-cache    Makes kernel buffer writes before sending them to rclone. Without this, writethrough caching is used.`\r\n\r\nHowever I cannot compare it with webdav as this option is not supported in webdav. Can you enable this option in webdav? (not sure it that makes sense)\r\n\r\n\r\nSummarizing as per your request, \r\n\r\n- local works at 15Mbs. (Uploaded chunk 9 size 5396789, 13.84MB/s 00:06:23 1.5%)\r\n- enabling cache with write, similar as full (Uploaded chunk 70 size 13219333, 1.37MB/s 00:57:19 12.4%)\r\n- disabling cache, similar as full (Uploaded chunk 26 size 7003554, 1.40MB/s 01:01:37 3.7%)\r\n\r\n I made a lot of tests, with similar behaviour does not matter the cache (full or write).\r\n\r\nI have seen a lot differences in how duplicacy writes when in remote (directly connecting to b2 storage for instance that uploads the file and finish) or in local (I share the remotes by rclone mount option and then duplicacy uploads a temporary file and then rename it, so two operations for rclone), that's why I started requesting the collaboration to make an API work, so the behaviour of duplicacy can be under control.\r\n\r\nBasically (I am not blaming duplicacy of course)  [duplicacy is adding features](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/commit/bb652d0a8c7e89e9f0d4cb8acef7fdc453e21a6b) (thing that I really appreciate) however, those are causing some issues on the uploads through rclone.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/468724811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cvillabrille","id":38108596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTA4NTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38108596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille","html_url":"https://github.com/cvillabrille","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2174500268,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE3NDUwMDI2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2174500268","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-01T16:30:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2174500269,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNzQ1MDAyNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/2174500269","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-01T16:30:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/473658500","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3002#issuecomment-473658500","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3002","id":473658500,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzY1ODUwMA==","user":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-17T11:57:00Z","updated_at":"2019-03-17T11:57:00Z","body":">

That will help with the latency.\r\n\r\nCan you post a log from rclone with `-vv` of duplicacy doing a backup run (it will probably be quite big!) and we can have a go at analysing exactly what duplicacy is doing and why it might be slow.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/473658500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/474465575","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3002#issuecomment-474465575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3002","id":474465575,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDQ2NTU3NQ==","user":{"login":"cvillabrille","id":38108596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTA4NTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38108596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille","html_url":"https://github.com/cvillabrille","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-19T16:49:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T17:02:57Z","body":"I am sorry for the bit delay on my reply.\r\n\r\nI did something even better :)\r\n\r\nI have captured two situations for you.\r\n\r\n1.  Mounting a remote openDrive share on local and try to backup (commands and output are in the zip file). Final result is cancelled due to an upload error, and upload speed from duplicacy is 1.8 mb... , real network statistics shows more or less the same.\r\nIf you try to backup with duplicacy in local, it creates a file with 8 random chars + .tmp as name and then renames this file when it is written. That causes, when using rclone mount, a lot of failures and retries, [as it is explained here...](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/issues/550#issuecomment-469646031) I have managed to update a local copy of the duplicacy code (OMG so sorry about that!) and I have removed this renaming procedure which has made a backup of 40 hours to work continuously. \r\nFor our (this) test I have used the compiled binary without this code removed. Maybe you can investigate on that to improve the backups mounted through rclone in local by duplicacy ( I consider this renaming code a bit problematic, even when I absolutely understand the creator wants a reliable write,  that is why I have opened the issue with duplicacy, however, no answer yet :(  ). \r\n[log_rclone_mount.zip](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/files/2984483/log_rclone_mount.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Sharing through \"_rclone serve webdav_\" and performing the same backup test.\r\n[log_rclone_webdav.zip](https://github.com/ncw/rclone/files/2984504/log_rclone_webdav.zip)\r\nThe size of logs is very different, bigger on the \"local\" backup.\r\nBackup lasted for 12 mins with webdav, when it is suppose to take 1 or 2 mins to upload 1Gb at full speed (200Mb upload speed bandwidth)\r\nTest was made with 1Gb of data, cache folder is in a SSD disk, data for backup is in spinning disk.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have noticed also openDrive speed is very low compared with others, does not matter if its through rclone native or webdav setup (then you have the limitation of connections which must be less than 30 concurrent connections, otherwise you receive webdav error \"Maximum backoff reached\" and no uploads are performed).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/474465575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cvillabrille","id":38108596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTA4NTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38108596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille","html_url":"https://github.com/cvillabrille","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/497283171","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3002#issuecomment-497283171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3002","id":497283171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzI4MzE3MQ==","user":{"login":"cvillabrille","id":38108596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTA4NTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38108596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille","html_url":"https://github.com/cvillabrille","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvillabrille/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T10:24:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T11:33:34Z","body":"Hi

here](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/commit/2b56d576c7ac192d8fefa512b91840f85c79f61e) and you replied on:\r\n\r\n> Basically when Duplicacy looked for a path like storage/ , the webdav implementation in rclone returned information about storage (with the trailing slash removed), so Duplicacy thought the path doesn’t exist.\r\n\r\nI was wondering whether that had any relationship, maybe not.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you are right :) I cannot see the diference (after enabling debug mode in both) however, the error is very clear:\r\n\r\n* Using latest beta, I receive the

dRock-JottaCNew:Duplicacy/dataRock64-data  --addr localhost:9093  --htpasswd /root/htpass  -vvv\r\n\r\n* latest) /usr/bin/rclone.good serve webdav dRock-Jottaold:Duplicacy/dataRock64-data  --addr localhost:9093  --htpasswd /root/htpass  -vvv\r\n\r\n\r\nNot sure then if with the new validation against Jotta, they have changed how the files are requested (of course I am not blaming anyone :)), Just stating it works with the old version.\r\n\r\nThanks for your reply and sorry for the
