you could use the commands in that issue to check the output from `rclone authorize` is a base64 encoded token.\n\nThe output is valid BASE64.\nAnd it looks like JSON, I wonder though if the escaping is intended:\n\n```json\n{\"token\":\"{\\\"access_token\\\":\\\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6IlgwNFZFaUkwe....HIdVyaufhrFQ\\\",\\\"token_type\\\":\\\"Bearer\\\",\\\"refresh_token\\\":\\\"1.AXkAewi8KVI_....ihA\\\",\\\"expiry\\\":\\\"2025-07-25T23:46:30.2877933+02:00\\\",\\\"expires_in\\\":3888}\"}\n```\n\nAnyway the contained access_token is also valid - I checked with jwt.io.\n\nUsing `rclone authorize \"onedrive\"` and `rclone authorize \"onedrive\" \"ey....\"` is a difference.\nI don't want to use the \"rclone predefined\" (shared) client_id. I'm not an expert on OAUTH2 but in the former case the browser asks me to log in and then a consent screen shows up. With the latter command the browser directly shows a \"success\" screen.\n\n> This might be relevant also [#5835](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5835)\n\nI don't see any references to that issue in the logs.\n\n> Why are you supplying tenant?

I think the error message could be better!\n\nIt is base64 encoded to make it easier to cut and paste I think. Also rclone can add extra data to the response which I don't think it is doing here, so it doesn't need to be encoded.\n\nWhich terminal are you using and exactly how are you doing the cut and paste? I want to try to replicate here.\n\nThanks ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3149979736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18967066281,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAQ-n5M7AujkJzwAAAARqhnap","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/18967066281","actor":{"login":"naymore","id":11159667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTU5NjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11159667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore","html_url":"https://github.com/naymore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-04T10:19:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18967066307,"node_id":"SE_lADOAQ-n5M7AujkJzwAAAARqhnbD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/events/18967066307","actor":{"login":"naymore","id":11159667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTU5NjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11159667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore","html_url":"https://github.com/naymore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-04T10:19:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3154014478","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8688#issuecomment-3154014478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8688","id":3154014478,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M67_nEO","user":{"login":"naymore","id":11159667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTU5NjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11159667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore","html_url":"https://github.com/naymore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naymore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-05T08:04:36Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T08:08:06Z","body":"> Which terminal are you using and exactly how are you doing the cut and paste?
