terms of namespace collisions, one possibility would be to define config names as having a scope; e.g., \"global\" (global configuration), \"remote\" (for remote-specific configuration), etc.  When assigning a specific value to some config, the config name could be specified qualified or unqualified; for example,  `global.ca_cert` and `remote.type` are qualified name, while `ca_cert` and `type` are unqualified names.   (The `.` is just an example, the separator could any string; .e.g..,`::`)\n\nHere's a configuration using qualified names\n\n```\n[foo]\nremote.type = webdav\nremote.vendor = other\nremote.url = https://example.org:2880/my-data\nglobal.ca_cert = /path/to/CA.pem\n```\n\nHere's the same configuration using unqualified names\n```\n[foo]\ntype = webdav\nvendor = other\nurl = https://example.org:2880/my-data\nca_cert = /path/to/CA.pem\n```\n\nFor unqualified names, there would be a standard rule for finding the corresponding qualified name, in case there is any collision; for example, try with `remote` scope, if no a valid config then try with the `global` scope.\n\nThat way, configuration is backwards compatible and, if there is a namespace conflict (with the same name available as a global- and remote-specific config) and the standard rule doesn't select the correct name, the user can just write that config assignment using the qualified name.\n\nThat said, this approach is rather complex and might confuse people.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3063802250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"paulmillar","id":533081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzA4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar","html_url":"https://github.com/paulmillar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulmillar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/3063847969","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/8563#issuecomment-3063847969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/8563","id":3063847969,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAQ-n5M62npwh","user":{"login":"nielash","id":31582349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTgyMzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31582349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash","html_url":"https://github.com/nielash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-11T21:11:26Z","updated_at":"2025-07-11T21:11:26Z","body":"> [@albertony](https://github.com/albertony) and [@nielash](https://github.com/nielash) do you have any thoughts about this?\n\nI made a proof of concept for something very similar last year: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2697#issuecomment-1888668988 But (as happens all too often with me) I got busy with other things and haven't gotten around to finishing it. 😢 \n\nOn the issue of overriding globals at the remote level, take a look at [this comment](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2697#issuecomment-1925326234) where I list some possible considerations about that.

This patch collects up those overridden global vars and applies them to the context used to call NewFs **only**. This makes them great for overriding --ca-cert for example as that context gets passed straight into the fshttp creation, but useless for overriding --inplace (say) as that context is not used for the syncing.\n\nI think being able to override globals on a per backend basis is important so you can set --ca-cert for one remote and not another.\n\nIt would be dead easy to change the code to set the global context instead which is what your code does I think (haven't checked it recently) and that would be useful for --inplace \n\nPerhaps we do need something like @paulmillar idea and namespace the config.\n\nSo \n\n```\n[Remote]\ntype = blah\nendpoint = blah # backend config var unchanged \noverride.ca_cert = blah # override globals for this backend \nglobal.inplace = true # really set global vars\n```\n\nI think these will be used relatively infrequently but having two types of global var override might be complicated to explain!\n\n> On the issue of overriding globals at the remote level, take a look at [this comment](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2697#issuecomment-1925326234) where I list some possible considerations about that.
