It starts listing files and directories inside of the bucket but then after about 5 seconds, it consistently fails with the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to ncdu: ncdu directory listing: ncdu listing failed: strconv.ParseInt: parsing \"1.54854926086E 12\": invalid syntax\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.46\r\n- os/arch: darwin/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nApple macOS Mojave 10.14.3 (18D109) [64-bit]\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
