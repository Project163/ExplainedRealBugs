Can be merged (after review)\n\nPaths in local file systems are now all absolute. \n\nChanging \"\\\" to \"/\" prior to that makes \"C:\\\" change to \"C:/\", which is incorrectly interpreted as _current directory_ by `filepath.Abs()`, so we cannot use `filepath.toSlash()` before we make the path absolute.\n\nFixes #124 \n\nTO REVIEW: `filepath.ToSlash()` is removed for ALL filesystems, so

we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\ninstead of filing an issue.  We'll reply quickly and it won't increase our massive issue backlog.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea for an improvement, then please search the old issues first and if you don't find your idea, make a new issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nWhen I run a rclone task that may take a while, I run it through tmux. I can check in on it as needed by opening an attached --read-only tmux session. I add read-only in case my cat decides to run across the keyboard.\r\n\r\nIf I am running a substantial number of --transfers, the primary info scrolls up before I can read it. Would like the option of seeing the INFO and the current transfers if possible, even if the first part of the transfers list is scrolled out of view.\r\n\r\nSuggesting the Transfers list be displayed before the INFO printout, or the ability to format / set order. \r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.43.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.11\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux Mint 4.15.0-34-generic #37-Ubuntu x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using? (eg Google Drive)\r\n\r\nGoogle Drive\r\n\r\n#### The command you were trying to run (eg `rclone copy /tmp remote:tmp`)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone sync ${SOURCE_PATH} ${DESTINATION_PATH} \\\r\n  --backup-dir ${ARCHIVE_DESTINATION_PATH} \\\r\n  --exclude-from ${EXCLUDE_FILE} \\\r\n  -v --skip-links \\\r\n  --transfers=32 \\\r\n  --checkers=16 \\\r\n  --drive-chunk-size=16384k \\\r\n

:-) We understand you are having a problem with rclone; we want to help you with that!\r\n\r\nIf you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum:\r\n\r\n    https://forum.rclone.org/\r\n\r\ninstead of filing an issue for a quick response.\r\n\r\nIf you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?\r\n\r\n    https://beta.rclone.org/\r\n    \r\nIf you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nThe Rclone Developers\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\n\r\nRclone won't start the OAuth fetch Token process after running a config edit or a new configuration wizard when setting up service Accounts. \r\nTried it with current stable release and beta release.\r\nTried it by editing current configuration from regular OAuth API Keys to SA, and creating a fresh new config from 0. \r\n\r\nIn all situations when it gets to the point where it normally would ask to fetch the OAuth token by starting the browser  or by using the URL, it hangs for a brief second or two, and moves on to the Teams Drive question.  Under no circumstances it lets you fetch the token.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n\r\nrclone v1.52.1\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.14.4\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n5.4.0-33-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Thu May 21 12:53:59 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n\r\n####  Which cloud storage system are you using?
