Ideally, they should (we should lobby them to) include a max file size indicator in the API so that you can build to that.\n\nAny flag you put in today could be invalidated tomorrow - especially since the Amazon app fails as well, it may be a legitimate bug. Perhaps, if an upload fails with a 500 error at the end, it should be marked and not re-tried - the issue that I had was that rclone would retry again, effectively wasting many hours.\n\nFor now, perhaps a warning in the release notes and I'll using your existing  --max-size=50GB flag.
