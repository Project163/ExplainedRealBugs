What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThe rclone test info command runs tests and creates temporary files, but it\r\nwas not properly cleaning up these files in some cases, leaving them behind.\r\n\r\nThis change improves the cleanup process in a few ways:\r\n\r\nIt generates a unique temporary directory name for running the tests to avoid interfering with any existing files in the specified remote path.\r\nIt creates the temporary directory before running the tests.\r\nAfter the tests are completed, it uses fs.Purge() to recursively delete the temporary directory and its contents. If the remote does not support purging, it falls back to manually removing files and directories.\r\nIt adds a new --keep-test-files flag to allow users to optionally keep the test files for further inspection if needed.\r\nWith these modifications, the rclone test info command now properly cleans\r\nup the temporary files it creates during the tests, fixing the issue of\r\nleftover files while still allowing inspection of the test files if desired.\r\n\r\nFixes #5572\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n#7209 \r\n-->\r\n\r\n####
