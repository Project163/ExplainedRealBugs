What is your current rclone version (output from `rclone version`)?\r\n\r\nrclone v1.53.3-DEV\r\n- os/arch: linux/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15.5\r\n\r\n#### What problem are you are trying to solve?\r\n\r\nbe able to `rclone ls` (or more important - access `rclone mount`ed) files from S3 where multiple versions of a file exist (and likely differ).  Similarly, I believe, dropbox and possibly others do provide versioning of files (but not sure if exposed via API etc, never tried), so such functionality could be useful there as well.\r\n\r\n#### How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that?\r\n\r\nProvide \r\n- a command line option (e.g., `--versions`) for `ls` and `mount` to enable access to versions of the files\r\n- some \"semantic\" for a file tree, so a user was able to ls/access a specific (not just current) version of a file. E.g., since unlikely to collide, could be just a directory named after the filename with `@` (or something even less to collide, e.g. `.rclone_versions`) where different versions would be listed.  Original file would be present as well, unless it was actually deleted (but prior versions still exist).  May be even aforementioned `--versions` could just become `--versions-dir-suffix SUFFIX` so it would be up for a user to choose its poison (and any non-empty value would trigger this versioning support)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>e.g., there are two version of s3://openneuro.org/ds000001/CHANGES file and the latest is available (not a DeleteMarker):</summary> \r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$> datalad ls -aL --list-content md5 s3://openneuro.org/ds000001/CHANGES \r\nConnecting to bucket: openneuro.org\r\n[INFO   ] S3 session: Connecting to the bucket openneuro.org anonymously \r\nBucket info:\r\n  Versioning: S3ResponseError: 403 Forbidden\r\n     Website: S3ResponseError: 403 Forbidden\r\n         ACL: <Policy: openneurocommon (owner) = FULL_CONTROL, http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers = READ, rblair2 = FULL_CONTROL, http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers = READ_ACP>\r\nds000001/CHANGES 2020-08-21T20:27:29.000Z 286 ver:rgzXS_kxpT28qCt4vE3KfSoKDbRC9Na5  acl:AccessDenied  http://openneuro.org.s3.amazonaws.com/ds000001/CHANGES?versionId=rgzXS_kxpT28qCt4vE3KfSoKDbRC9Na5 [OK] 54904bf147105d8c8d2ef5903eeaadad\r\nds000001/CHANGES 2020-08-21T20:27:28.000Z DeleteMarker\r\nds000001/CHANGES 2020-08-21T20:24:13.000Z 291 ver:hdVjSXh5y7Z.SNYCW7G2T9sIPhu75yyw  acl:AccessDenied  http://openneuro.org.s3.amazonaws.com/ds000001/CHANGES?versionId=hdVjSXh5y7Z.SNYCW7G2T9sIPhu75yyw [OK] 63e3213153aa31569fb64710b0c9a113\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nIf I `rclone mount` that bucket, I can only access the latest version:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$> md5sum /tmp/m-openneuro/ds000001/CHANGES\r\n54904bf147105d8c8d2ef5903eeaadad  /tmp/m-openneuro/ds000001/CHANGES\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it would have been cool if there were smth like:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$> md5sum /tmp/m-openneuro/ds000001/CHANGES{,@/*}\r\n54904bf147105d8c8d2ef5903eeaadad  /tmp/m-openneuro/ds000001/CHANGES\r\n54904bf147105d8c8d2ef5903eeaadad  /tmp/m-openneuro/ds000001/CHANGES@/rgzXS_kxpT28qCt4vE3KfSoKDbRC9Na5\r\n63e3213153aa31569fb64710b0c9a113  /tmp/m-openneuro/ds000001/CHANGES@/hdVjSXh5y7Z.SNYCW7G2T9sIPhu75yyw\r\n```\r\nthen we could (ab)use in datalad to provide FUSE'ed access to git-annex'ed content (ref: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/4003)\r\n\r\nedit1 from a greedy me: I wish it was also supported somehow for HTTP remotes.  It will not be specifically a \"version\" but rather \"pass additional parameters to HTTP call\", e.g. like in the above example we have http://openneuro.org.s3.amazonaws.com/ds000001/CHANGES?versionId=rgzXS_kxpT28qCt4vE3KfSoKDbRC9Na5 URL, so if I could `cat CHANGES@/versionId=rgzXS_kxpT28qCt4vE3KfSoKDbRC9Na5` rclone would operate on a url with those additional parameters (so kinda like versions of the same URL) -- sure thing `rclone` would not be able to list any (until any requested) under that `@/`

you very much for contributing code or documentation to rclone! Please\r\nfill out the following questions to make it easier for us to review your\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to check all the boxes below all at once, feel free to take\r\nyour time and add more commits. If you're done and ready for review, please\r\ncheck the last box.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nThe goal is to be able to browse the b2 bucket state as it was at a specified point in time, using b2's file versions. This is especially useful in combination with other backup tools, such as restic, which may use rclone as a backend.\r\n\r\nI have not added any tests, since I did not find any for `--b2-versions` which is similar functionality but I might be looking in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nFor example, this allows the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrclone mount --b2-version-at=2022-03-13T00:00:00Z b2:bucket /mnt/rclone\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr when using a backup tool such as restic:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrestic -o 'rclone.args=serve restic --stdio --b2-version-at=2022-03-13T00:00:00Z' --no-lock mount /mnt/restic\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo access pruned backup files whose data is still kept by b2 lifecycle rules.\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\nYes, but not by me: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2126\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-new-feature-or-bug-fix).\r\n- [x] I have added tests for all changes in this PR if appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have added documentation for the changes if appropriate.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are in [house style](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).\r\n- [x] I'm done, this Pull Request is ready for review
