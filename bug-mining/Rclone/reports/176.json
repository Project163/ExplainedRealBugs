From what I can tell from Google (Can't find official documentation), it seems to be related with a DMCA strike:-\n\nhttps://forum.choiceofgames.com/t/dropbox-461-restricted-content/7636\nhttps://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?t=109199#p423968\n\nEtc...\n\n> 2016/06/29 07:50:32 ${FILE}: Failed to copy: failed to open source object: unexpected HTTP status code 461\n\nCurrently rclone attempts to copy it `--retries` times before erroring out. I think if you encounter a 461 error, there's no point retrying it (DMCA strike won't be removed between attempts) and the process should continue ignoring that file, outputting an error to stderr/at the end of the programs run.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
