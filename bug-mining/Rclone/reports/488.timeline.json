What is the problem you are having with rclone?\r\nUnable to login with MEGA with multiple different accounts. Tried 2 personal accounts, one Free (50 GB total) other Paid Plan (I think it's 500 GB - the simplest Paid Plan); and a 3rd one which was a \"burner\" account made with a simple password of ~20 chars of a-z, A-Z, 0-9 only. Neither of my Personal accounts are anywhere near full space.\r\n\r\nI tried following some steps from users with the same problem in other issue trackers in here (and forum); like disabling 2-FA, changing to a simple password, email with no \".\" between. Also no capital letters in email but none of my emails had it.\r\nMy last resort was \"spent\" when I made that burner account and tried both in `rclone v1.53.1` and `rclone-v1.54.0-beta.4818.72083c65a-windows-amd64`\r\n\r\nI followed this [https://rclone.org/mega/](url) setup guide but still now I can't seem to understand this part:\r\n> **NOTE**: The encryption keys need to have been already generated after a regular login via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the credentials in `rclone` will fail.\r\n\r\nI did open a browser and logged-in with the account before setting up that mega config guide. But I don't understand it very well, and in the guide I can't seem to find what's the difference between `rclone`'s credentials and MEGA's encryption keys.\r\nDo I have to paste this keys somewhere?! On the OneDrive setup you had to paste/confirm some ID stuff. But nothing similiar showed up to me in the mega config.\r\nI also tried loggin-in with the MEGA browser extension but neither worked. Same error on anything I try.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is your rclone version (output from `rclone version`)\r\n```\r\nrclone v1.53.1\r\n- os/arch: windows/amd64\r\n- go version: go1.15\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\nWindows 10 Home Single Language, 64 bit.
