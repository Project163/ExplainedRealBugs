What is the purpose of this change?\r\n\r\nFixes #8601 where rclone would unnecessarily retry downloads when the Link.Expire field was unreliable but the download URL contained a valid expire query parameter. This primarily affects cases where media links are unavailable or when no_media_link is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe Link.Valid() method now primarily checks the URL's expire query parameter (as Unix timestamp) and falls back to the Expire field only when URL parsing fails. This eliminates the \"error no link\" retry loops while maintaining backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n- Parse expire query parameter from download URLs as primary validation\r\n- Keep existing Expire field validation as fallback\r\n- Add comprehensive unit tests\r\n\r\n#### Was the change discussed in an issue or in the forum before?\r\n\r\n#8601\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the
