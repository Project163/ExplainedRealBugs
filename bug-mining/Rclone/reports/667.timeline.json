This would cause the illegal seek.\r\n\r\nI recently put in a work-around for this as it happens in `rclone serve sftp` too. See d377842395b897e9cee96f6a1c2fdd25f20e4f9c and af030f74f5c9c49d337ad768b307e50d3cfd60fe.  The first was in v1.48.0 but the second isn't so it might be worth having a go with [the latest beta](https://beta.rclone.org) to see if it fixes it.\r\n\r\nIf it is still a problem a log with `-vv` of the problem happening should shed some light.\r\n\r\nI don't see any ERRORs in your logs in the other issue - I'd really expect to see an ERROR corresponding to that illegal seek.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/523394199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ncw","id":536803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjgwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw","html_url":"https://github.com/ncw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ncw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/comments/523397230","html_url":"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3461#issuecomment-523397230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone/issues/3461","id":523397230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzM5NzIzMA==","user":{"login":"trapexit","id":197676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzY3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/197676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit","html_url":"https://github.com/trapexit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trapexit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-21T10:25:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T10:25:58Z","body":"If you look at the mergerfs strace you can see that it's a single write starting from offset 0.
