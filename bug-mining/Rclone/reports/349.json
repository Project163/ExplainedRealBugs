Initially, disabling the bwlimit works fine, but if a later schedule overrides the `tokenBucket`, sending the signal seems to activate the `tokenBucket` that was disabled with the first signal. \r\n\r\nI believe this is the case due to the variable swap in `account_unix.go` as well as the ticker in `startTokenTicker()` not considering whether the bwlimit is currently disabled or enabled. If it's disabled, it should probably not set `tokenBucket` to the scheduled bwlimit, but instead `prevTokenBucket`, s.t. the scheduled bwlimit only becomes active when toggled again. However, unfortunately I currently don't have the time to verify this, but I hope this helps fixing the issue.\r\n\r\n> What is your rclone version (eg output from `rclone -V`)\r\n\r\n`d025066fae88173d165cff5c109bab6226a09a7f` (But it looks like this issue is still present in the current code in `master`)\r\n\r\n> Which OS you are using and how many bits (eg Windows 7, 64 bit)\r\n\r\nLinux, ARM32\r\n\r\n> Which cloud storage system are you using?
