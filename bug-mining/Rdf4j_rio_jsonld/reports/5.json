The signatures of the two methods can be moved to a new interface, while preserving source and binary compatibility, which can then be reused in other parts of the API, such as GraphQueryResult in future major versions (cannot convert GraphQueryResult at this point because the getNamespaces return type is incompatible).\r\n\r\nBecause ``getNamespace`` is a default method, ``NamespaceAware`` can also be a ``FunctionalInterface``, so a lambda can be used in place of it.\r\n\r\nThe existing precedent for this is ``GetStatementOptional``, that is used to abstract away how statements are accessed, and which allows lambda's to be used in place of it.","closed_by":{"login":"ansell","id":82365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell","html_url":"https://github.com/ansell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/834/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
