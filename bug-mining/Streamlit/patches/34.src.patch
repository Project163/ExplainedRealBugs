+      exercising permissions granted by this License.
+
+      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+      source, and configuration files.
+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

+   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
+
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
+
+Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
+conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
+original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
+and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
+following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
+exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
+
+     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
+     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
+     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
+     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
+     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
+     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
+     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
+     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
+     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
+     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
+     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
+     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
+	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
+
+     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
+     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
+     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
+     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
+     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
+     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
+     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
+     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
+     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
+     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
+     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
+     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
+     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
+     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

+
+By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
+to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
+Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
+extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
+granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
+these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
+consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
+Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
+
+
+Section 1 -- Definitions.
+
+  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
+     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
+     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
+     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
+     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
+     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
+     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
+     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
+     synched in timed relation with a moving image.
+
+  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
+     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
+     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
+
+  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
+     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
+     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
+     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
+     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
+     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
+     Rights.
+
+  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
+     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
+     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
+     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
+     agreements.
+
+  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
+     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
+     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
+
+  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
+     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
+     License.
+
+  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
+     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
+     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
+     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
+
+  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
+     under this Public License.
+
+  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
+     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
+     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
+     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
+     available to the public including in ways that members of the
+     public may access the material from a place and at a time
+     individually chosen by them.
+
+  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
+     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
+     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
+     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
+     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
+
+  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
+     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
+
+
+Section 2 -- Scope.
+
+  a. License grant.
+
+       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
+          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
+          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
+          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
+
+            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
+               in part; and
+
+            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
+
+       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
+          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
+          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
+          its terms and conditions.
+
+       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
+          6(a).
+
+       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
+          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
+          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
+          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
+          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
+          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
+          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
+          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
+          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
+          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
+          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
+
+       5. Downstream recipients.
+
+            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
+               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
+               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
+               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
+               Public License.
+
+            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
+               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
+               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
+               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
+               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
+               Material.
+
+       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
+          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
+          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
+          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
+          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
+          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
+
+  b. Other rights.
+
+       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
+          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
+          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
+          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
+          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
+          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
+          Rights, but not otherwise.
+
+       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
+          Public License.
+
+       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
+          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
+          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
+          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
+          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
+          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
+
+
+Section 3 -- License Conditions.
+
+Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
+following conditions.
+
+  a. Attribution.
+
+       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
+          form), You must:
+
+            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
+               with the Licensed Material:
+
+                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
+                    Material and any others designated to receive
+                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
+                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
+                    designated);
+
+                ii. a copyright notice;
+
+               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
+
+                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
+                    warranties;
+
+                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
+                    extent reasonably practicable;
+
+            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
+               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
+
+            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
+               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
+               hyperlink to, this Public License.
+
+       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
+          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
+          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
+          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
+          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
+          information.
+
+       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
+          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
+          reasonably practicable.
+
+       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
+          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
+          Material from complying with this Public License.
+
+
+Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
+
+Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
+apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
+
+  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
+     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
+     portion of the contents of the database;
+
+  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
+     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
+     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
+     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
+
+  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
+     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
+
+For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
+replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
+Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
+
+
+Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
+
+  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
+     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
+     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
+     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
+     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
+     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
+     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
+     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
+     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
+     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
+     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
+     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
+     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
+     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
+     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
+     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
+     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
+     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
+     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
+     waiver of all liability.
+
+
+Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
+
+  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
+     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
+     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
+     terminate automatically.
+
+  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
+     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
+
+       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
+          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
+          violation; or
+
+       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
+
+     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
+     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
+     of this Public License.
+
+  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
+     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
+     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
+     will not terminate this Public License.
+
+  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
+     License.
+
+
+Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
+
+  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
+     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
+
+  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
+     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
+     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
+
+
+Section 8 -- Interpretation.
+
+  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
+     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
+     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
+     be made without permission under this Public License.
+
+  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
+     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
+     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
+     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
+     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
+     conditions.
+
+  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
+     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
+     Licensor.
+
+  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
+     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
+     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
+     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

-      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
-      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
-      and conversions to other media types.
-
-      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
-      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-

-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
-      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.

-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
