📚 Context\r\nAs described in #3362: \r\n> _For st.map and PyDeck it's not as easy to make them follow the exact theme, but we could at least make them use [the dark map](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/grid_layer.html) style when the app is show in Streamlit's dark theme with no overrides._\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the [mapbox map style](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/styles/#mapbox-styles) (either `light` or `dark`) for st.map to that of Streamlit's active theme from the frontend when the user doesn't specify a `map_style`. The theme is injected on the frontend using the `withTheme` hook based on the luminance of the background color. \r\n\r\n\r\n- What kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n  - [x] Feature\r\n\r\n## 🧠 Description of Changes\r\n\r\n- If the user specifies a `map_style` in the pydeck object, we respect their choice and don't overwrite the map style on the frontend\r\n- If `map_style` is unset: on the frontend, we set the map style URI to either <a href=\"\">mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v9</a> or <a href=\"\">mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9</a>, based on the active Streamlit theme.\r\n- Uses the active theme from the frontend because we currently do not have the info in the backend on which theme is selected. See #5009.\r\n\r\n  - [x] This is a visible (user-facing) change\r\n\r\n###

Problem\n\n`prefers-color-scheme` [can be used](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to modify styling of elements depending on light/dark color themes. However using that currently tracks the OS color scheme and ignores the light/dark setting in Streamlit. This leads to mismatches when a user (or developer) explicitly selects light/dark mode instead of using the \"Use system setting\" option.\n\nHere is an example of the mismatch, using the example from the linked docs:\n\n[![Open in Streamlit Cloud](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/?issue=gh-6456)\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\n\n\nst.write(\n    \"\"\"<style>\n.theme-a {\n  background: #dca;\n  color: #731;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .theme-a.adaptive {\n    background: #753;\n    color: #dcb;\n    outline: 5px dashed #000;\n  }\n}\n.theme-b {\n  background: #447;\n  color: #bbd;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {\n  .theme-b.adaptive {\n    background: #bcd;\n    color: #334;\n    outline: 5px dotted #000;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n<div class=\"box theme-a\">Theme A (initial)</div>\n<div class=\"box theme-a adaptive\">Theme A (changed if dark preferred)</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"box theme-b\">Theme B (initial)</div>\n<div class=\"box theme-b adaptive\">Theme B (changed if light preferred)</div>\n\"\"\",\n    unsafe_allow_html=True,\n)\n```\n\n#### System theme light, app theme light (or \"Use system setting\"):\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7876996/230677451-bcc02cab-fe9b-4635-b384-2bc849bb2508.png)\n#### System theme light, app theme dark (mismatch):\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7876996/230677776-7c39b683-05ab-43ed-a679-6a83b0dfaca1.png)\n#### System theme dark, app theme dark (or \"Use system setting\"):\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7876996/230677703-e4f04da6-9ee1-46cd-a343-13fb7b5db80e.png)\n#### System theme dark, app theme light (mismatch):\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7876996/230677487-99d49ead-296c-42ec-8fb5-9876022666af.png)\n\n\n### Solution\n\n**Workarounds:** #3990 or #5009 would help work around it since it would let the developer adjust the styling programmatically.\n\n**Preferred solution:** Somehow propagating the streamlit theme choice so `prefers-color-scheme` works as expected.\n\n### Additional context\n\nIn my case I embed an SVG that has its own styling, but it can use `prefers-color-scheme` in its `style` property to determine whether the background is dark or white and color its elements accordingly. Since the SVG that has a transparent background, elements that I draw on it will not be visible if the system theme doesn't match the app theme.\n\nRight now I set `base = \"light\"` in the streamlit config and configure my SVG styling accordingly, but users can still change it through the settings menu and that breaks visibility.\n\n---\n\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the

Problem\r\n\r\nI'm trying to dynamically fetch the current theme (as in, the colors and fonts it provides) in order to properly style visuals created from an external source without creating multiple copies of the same page, as is done in the demo. However, I could find not a good way to grab these visuals.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n**MVP:** Provide a function returning the theme, possibly as a dictionary containing the theme with appropriate key mappings\r\n\r\n**Possible additions:** Instead of a dictionary of key-value pairs, return a mutable theme object, which can be modified with changes reflected in real time. For instance, if playing an album, this theme object could be modified to make the page match the album cover.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to
