Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\r\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\n- create vega_lite_chart and populate it with some data\r\n- keep first and last values in the array the same as before BUT add several data points to the data but also change some data in the middle\r\n- Following code only checks first and last items in the array and determines that whole array is the same as before therefore no need to re-render middle parts which is absolutely wrong:
