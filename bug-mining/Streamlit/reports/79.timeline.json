This isn't super straightforward unfortunately because the underlying BaseWeb component we use for `st.date_input` ([Datepicker](https://baseweb.design/components/datepicker/)) does not directly offer a setting for the start day in a week. We might be able to get this to work automatically though using the `locale` property. But since this is a bit more involved, it will probably take us a while until we get to it.

Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.\n- [X] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\n The current functionality of time_input appears to be hard coded to a 24 hour format (ie 14:30). It would be helpful to have an option to use a 12 hour format instead (ie 2:30pm)\r\n\n\n### Why?\n\nMany people are used to thinking about time in a 12 hour format. Having that functionality supported when building UIs in Streamlit will greatly improve the user experience. \n\n### How?\n\nPerhaps a parameter for time_input such as \"use_24hr\" where its True by default but you can set it to False resulting in 12 hour functionality. \n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No
