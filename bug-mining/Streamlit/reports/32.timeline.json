This PR is targeting the `vdonato/sql-connection` branch for now so that the diff looks nicer.\r\nWe'll retarget it to `feature/st.experimental_connection` once the other branch is merged.\r\n\r\n## 📚 Context\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an implementation of another first party connection class: the `Snowpark` connection.\r\nThis connection is a thin wrapper around the `snowflake-snowpark-python` library to make it play nicely\r\nwith the `st.experimental_connection` factory function. It also implements locking around operations with\r\nthe underlying library so that the app author doesn't have to think of thread safety.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to with our `SQL` connector, there's still a bit of work to do for this one:\r\n* Retries for the `read_sql` method still need to be implemented.\r\n* We need to add some unit tests for the class itself. This will be done in a later PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-21T01:56:57Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T01:56:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6531","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6531/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6531/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6531/events","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/6531","id":1677645492,"node_id":"PR_kwDODCoeTs5O0PiO","number":6531,"title":"Improve

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nThe emoji data is the biggest object when running a blank Streamlit app. Compiling the regex is also slightly expensive. However, the emoji data is only required if there is a check for emojis; many apps might not require this. Therefore, this PR makes the emoji module to lazy load only if it is actually required.  \r\n\r\nThis also adds a precheck for emoji checks to make sure that the string even contains non alphanumeric characters before using the more expensive emoji regex. \r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6066\r\n\r\n## Testing

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nThe deprecation of the `runner.fixMatplotlib` and the decision to always use the `Agg` backend, made it possible to just configure the matplotlib backend via the config option (also see the previous TODO comment). This prevents an unnecessary import of matplotlib at the server start and allows to lazy load this import.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\nRelated to #6066\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Added unit and e2e tests to make sure that `matplotlib` is properly lazy-loaded.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree
