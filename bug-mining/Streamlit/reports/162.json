Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nAfter entering multiple lines of text into the st.chat_input control, the input box remains at the multi-line height even after sending the message \n\n<img width=\"767\" height=\"512\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54c34a3a-a3a8-40fc-aaa3-c6c35ab96d37\" />\n\nor clearing the input. It does not shrink back to the original single-line height.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\ntext =  st.chat_input(\"input\")\nif text:\n    st.write(text)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nUse Streamlit version 1.47.1.\nAdd st.chat_input to your app, for example:\n\nimport streamlit as st\ntext =  st.chat_input(\"input\")\nif text:\n    st.write(text)\n\nRun the app.\nIn the chat input, enter text that spans multiple lines (e.g., using Shift+Enter).\nSend the message (press Enter or click send).\nObserve the chat input box.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter sending the message, the chat input box should shrink back to its original single-line height if the input area is empty.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe chat input box remains at the expanded multi-line height, even after sending the message or clearing the input.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.47.1\n- Python version: 3.11.8\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 22 LTS\n- Browser: Edge\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12079/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
