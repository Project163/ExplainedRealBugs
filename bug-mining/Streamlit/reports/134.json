Paste the above example into a python file (like `example.py`)\r\n2. Run it with Streamlit (e.g. `streamlit run example.py`)\r\n3. Point your browser to the URL listed.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code block should render as\r\n\r\n```\r\n    line 1\r\n    line 2\r\n    line 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nBlock is rendered as\r\n\r\n```\r\nline 1\r\n    line 2\r\n    line 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- Not sure.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.20.0\r\n- Python version: 3.10.10\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04\r\n- Browser: Firefox 110.0.1\r\n- Virtual environment: poetry 1.3-built\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6302/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
