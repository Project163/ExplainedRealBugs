Inspecting the console reveals that `main.7994a814.js` contains an HTML file rather than a JS file, and so the browser fails to parse it. The specific error is: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' (at main.7994a814.js:1:1)`\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n#### In ~/streamlit_project_root:\r\n```zsh\r\npython -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate\r\npip install streamlit\r\ntouch Homepage.py\r\nmkdir pages && cd pages && touch 01_TestPage.py && cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Directory structure should look like this:\r\n```zsh\r\nstreamlit_project_root\r\n├── Homepage.py\r\n└── pages\r\n    └── 01_TestPage.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Homepage.py:\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nst.write(\"Hello world! This is the homepage\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 01_TestPage.py:\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nst.write(\"Hello world! This is 01_TestPage.py\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### In ~/streamlit_project_root:\r\n```zsh\r\nstreamlit run Homepage.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### In a new terminal tab:\r\n```zsh\r\nopen http://localhost:8501/TestPage/ # note the trailing slash\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a Streamlit multi-page app\r\n2. Navigate to one of the sub-pages\r\n3. Add a trailing \"/\" to the URL (if there wasn't one before)\r\n4. Observe blank white screen and SyntaxError in the browser console\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPages should load correctly regardless of the presence or absence of a trailing slash in the URL.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe page does not load (blank white screen) and the browser console reveals a syntax error in `main.7994a814.js`. The first character in that file is the \"<\" of `<!doctype html>`, and it is this character that throws the syntax error. This is understandable, as trying to parse HTML as a Javascript file is a recipe for failure.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-22 at 12 13 24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f8cefdd-1a7b-425a-a422-25484b56bdab)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-22 at 12 16 09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf66257-116a-4843-b085-1eb71937290c)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.36.0\r\n- Python version: 3.12.3\r\n- Operating System (the issue occurs both locally and in our containerized on-prem instance):\r\n    - Prod container: [ubi8/python-312](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/python-312/657c12cade3664622a12ed50?container-tabs=overview)\r\n    - Local development OS: macOS Sonoma 14.5\r\n- Browser: Google Chrome 126.0.6478.183\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9127/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
