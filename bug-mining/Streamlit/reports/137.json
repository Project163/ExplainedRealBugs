Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen visiting an app with a URL that has an anchor link (e.g. `foo.com/myapp#myanchor`) Streamlit should scroll to the anchor `#myanchor` on the page. This is not happening today.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.header(\"My title 1\")\nfor _ in range(30):\n    st.text(\"blah \" * 100)\n\nst.header(\"My title 2\")\nfor _ in range(30):\n    st.text(\"blah \" * 100)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run the code above\n1. A Streamlit app will load in a browser tab \n1. Open a new browser tab (it has to be a new tab!)\n1. Navigate to the URL http://localhost:8501/#my-title-2 \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe app loads and the viewport is scrolled to \"My title 2\".\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe app loads but the viewport is at the top, at \"My title 1\".\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.45\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Operating System: MacOS\n- Browser: Chrome\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11551/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
