`StyledColorPicker` to prevent container from shrinking below the 40x40px color block\n- Uses same theme value as color block to keep them synchronized\n\n## GitHub Issue Link\n\nFixes #12872\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n- [x] E2E Tests (added snapshot test for `width=20` case)\n- [x] Manual testing completed\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThe color block has a hard-coded width of `theme.sizes.minElementHeight` (40px). Without a corresponding `minWidth` on the container, specifying `width < 40px` caused the label to shrink while the color block stayed fixed, creating visual inconsistency.\n\n---\n\n**Contribution

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nPrevents st.feedback icons from wrapping when width is too small.\r\n\r\n**Changes Made:**\r\n\r\n- Added minimum width enforcement at Python API level\r\n- Thumbs (2 icons): 65px minimum\r\n- Faces/Stars (5 icons): 155px minimum\r\n\r\nBelow these minimums, we use `width=\"content\"` so that the wrapper layout container will hug the icons. The minimums correspond to 18px font size since the icons themselves are sized in REM. \r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link\r\n\r\nFixes #12068\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- [x] Python unit tests (added test for minimum width enforcement)\r\n- [x] E2E Tests (added snapshot tests for thumbs and stars with small widths)\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes:**\r\n\r\nWhen users specify a width smaller than needed for the icons, the widget now enforces the minimum width to prevent wrapping. This follows the same pattern as st.color_picker (gh-12872) by enforcing constraints at the Python API level, preventing layout wrapper size mismatches.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20808324950,"node_id":"CE_lADODCoeTs7UCddhzwAAAATYRddW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/20808324950","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-11-08T15:24:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20808456052,"node_id":"REFE_lADODCoeTs7UCddhzwAAAATYR9d0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/20808456052","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a7713a79fd86f2e80b4aaacb91c4f02db3793bfe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sree-hari-s/streamlit/commits/a7713a79fd86f2e80b4aaacb91c4f02db3793bfe","created_at":"2025-11-08T15:51:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
