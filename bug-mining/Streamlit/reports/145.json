The more I think about it the more I think we should actually change audio input so the label *isn't* disabled. It looks a bit weird because it seems like the whole component was intentionally disabled, whereas in reality, the component is enabled, it's just that you can't record because the permission isn't there. \n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.audio_input(\"Record your voice\")\nst.camera_input(\"Take a photo\")\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nOpen the app, deny microphone and camera permissions. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nLabels have different colors. \n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThey should have the same color. \n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.46\n- Python version:\n- Operating System:\n- Browser:\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"jrieke","id":5103165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDMxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11700/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11700/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
