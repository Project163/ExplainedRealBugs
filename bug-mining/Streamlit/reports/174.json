Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.\n- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nIf the page navigation is shown in the sidebar, you can mix single pages and page sections by creating an \"empty\" section (`\"\"`):\n\n```python\npages = {\n        \"\": [\n            st.Page(page1, title=\"Home\", icon=\":material/home:\"),\n            st.Page(page2, title=\"Data visualizations\", icon=\":material/monitoring:\"),\n        ],\n        \"Admin\": [st.Page(page3, title=\"Settings\", icon=\":material/settings:\")],\n    }\n```\n\nThis will make the first two pages show up without a section and put the other pages into a section:\n\n<img width=\"246\" height=\"223\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2087626a-30f2-40d3-afd5-193b2c5cee3c\" />\n\nHowever, if you use top nav, these pages will show up in a section without a label:\n\n<img width=\"228\" height=\"153\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05b0b36a-247a-4d6d-921c-767ef3844912\" />\n\nIt would be great to show these pages as individual pages, and only put the other sections into a dropdown. \n\n\n\n### Why?\n\nSee original report in #11968\n\n### How?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No
