So I tested and ran the code using 1.45.00 and got the following error\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3cb0efc-5dda-40f9-94c5-daa7fc8b4ec9)\n\nI reran my code using 1.44.00 and the file_uploader worked without an issue. \n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\n# File uploader allows user to add file\nst.subheader('Step 1: Upload File')\nuploaded_file = st.file_uploader('Choose a text file', type='txt')\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. pip install streamlit==1.45.00\n2. run streamlit \n3. Upload a txt file.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWithout bugs, file is processed and uploaded to streamlit without any errors/issues.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nError Message:\n```\nstreamlit.errors.StreamlitAPIException: Invalid file extension: .txt. Allowed: ['.txt']\n```\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.45.00\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Browser: Edge\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11259/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
