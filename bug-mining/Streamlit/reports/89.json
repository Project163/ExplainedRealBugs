Please see this code snippet taken [from here](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.41.0/lib/streamlit/elements/widgets/time_widgets.py#L574):\r\n```\r\n    @gather_metrics(\"date_input\")\r\n    def date_input(\r\n        self,\r\n        label: str,\r\n        value: NullableScalarDateValue | None = \"today\",\r\n        min_value: NullableScalarDateValue = None,\r\n        max_value: NullableScalarDateValue = None,\r\n```\r\nThe type hint of `value` is the same as for min and max values even though `value` should accept a sequence, too.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport datetime\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\ntoday: datetime.date = datetime.date.today()\r\npast: datetime.date = today - datetime.timedelta(days=30)\r\nst.date_input(\"Date Range\", value=(past, today))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nmypy <path_to_file_with_example>.py\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSuccess: no issues found\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nError message:\r\n```\r\nerror: Argument \"value\" has incompatible type \"tuple[date, date]\"; expected \"date | datetime | str | Literal['today'] | None\"  [arg-type]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.41.0\r\n- Python version: 3.12.8\r\n- mypy version: 1.13.0\r\n- Operating System: -\r\n- Browser: -\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10005/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
