Ideally one could specify which buttons to show there. In a coorporate environment having the option to link to the ticketing system etc could be very powerful.\n\n\n### Why?\n\nSending the stacktrace to chatGPT might be useful for developers to get quick help, but for the average user that will not lead to anything useful and they will only waste time on this to figure it out instead of reaching out / raising a ticket because the average user won't be able to fix the code anyway.\n\n### How?\n\nIn the config file give an option to disable the buttons and potentially even customize the names and links.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10924/reactions","total_count":20,"+1":20,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10924/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
