Then, if you pass that page to `st.navigation`, Streamlit enters an infinite run condition.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\ndne = st.Page(\"not a real file\", title=\"DNE\")\r\nreal = st.Page(\"real.py\", title=\"Real page\")\r\nreal2 = st.Page(\"real2.py\", title=\"Real2 page\")\r\n\r\nst.navigation([real, real2]) # No error\r\n# st.navigation([real, real2, dne]) # Infinite run condition\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an `app.py` file as above and two other files (`real.py` and `real2.py`) in the same directory, which can be empty.\r\n2. `streamlit run apply`\r\n3. As is, there is no error.\r\n4. Comment out the `st.navigation` line and uncomment the other one (with the dne page).\r\n5. Observe the infinite run condition.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen declaring a page that does not exist, I expect `st.Page` to throw an error.\r\nIf `st.navigation` is passed an invalid page, I expect `st.navigation` to throw an error.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: Streamlit v1.35.1.dev20240602\r\n- Python version: 3.11\r\n- Operating System: Mac\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8865/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8865/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
