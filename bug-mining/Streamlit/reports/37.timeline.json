issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nI want a new `embed_options` that sets the theme as the default one, or removes the theme setting saved in Local Storage.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nOnce you embed a Streamlit app with `embed_options=light_theme` or `embed_options=dark_theme`,\r\nthe theme of the app is set to light or dark and its config is saved in the browser's Local Storage.\r\nSo, when you introduce a custom theme in the app and want to switch the theme of the embedded app to it, there is no way to invalidate the saved light or dark theme setting for the users who have already visited the page, so you can't show the custom theme to them by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis issue is based on a similar motivation to

doesn't affect Local Storage and is only responsible for \"setting the initial theme selection when appropriate = when custom config is not set,\" in addition to making the custom theme most priority

wrote.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/1665818100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"whitphx","id":3135397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzUzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3135397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx","html_url":"https://github.com/whitphx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"whitphx","id":3135397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzUzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3135397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx","html_url":"https://github.com/whitphx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-08T08:55:01Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T08:55:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hub-docs/issues/909","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hub-docs","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hub-docs/issues/909/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hub-docs/issues/909/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/hub-docs/issues/909/events","html_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/issues/909","id":1834476201,"node_id":"I_kwDOHAyzVM5tV-Kp","number":909,"title":"HuggingFace

But a custom base theme would still override all (presumably). If there's a problem with this default behavior, we could add a new `embed_option` to turn it off somehow.
