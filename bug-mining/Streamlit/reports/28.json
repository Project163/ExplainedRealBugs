Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.\r\n- [X] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nApp renders with `width: 0px` for a frame or two, looking all funky:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1725\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 1 24 31 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/123422405/0fe2f6e4-52de-46ce-89b8-49e764a3fe28\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n`AutoSizer` initially renders the contents of the app with `width: 0px` while it's detecting the container's width, which combined with `word-break: break-word` of `stMarkdown`, makes things look all squished.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\n\r\nCould try setting `visibility: hidden` on the child of `AutoSizer` if `width === 0`? That way `AutoSizer` can still measure the real dimensions, but we don't show anything to the user for that first frame.\r\n\r\nSome code:\r\n```\r\nreturn (\r\n    <AutoSizer disableHeight={true} style={styledVerticalBlockWrapperStyles}>\r\n      {({ width }) => {\r\n        const propsWithNewWidth = { ...props, ...{ width } }\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n          <StyledVerticalBlock width={width} visibility={width === 0 ? 'hidden' : 'visible'} data-testid=\"stVerticalBlock\">\r\n            <ChildRenderer {...propsWithNewWidth} />\r\n          </StyledVerticalBlock>\r\n        )\r\n      }}\r\n    </AutoSizer>\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-wihuang","id":103006371,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiPAow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103006371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-wihuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-wihuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7155/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
