I would like to be able to detect what mode the user is viewing the app in in order to choose the correct custom styling. \n\n### Solution\n\n1. Create a new API function: `get_current_style`.\n\t  ```python\n\t  if st.get_current_style() == \"light\":\n\t      # do something\n\t  elif st.get_current_style() == \"dark\":\n\t      # do something else\n\t  ```\n\n2. Add this info to `get_config_option`.\n    \n\n### Additional context\n\nSome people have already discussed it here: https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/check-if-the-app-is-in-dark-mode-or-light-mode-at-runtime/20222\n\n---\n\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are most important to our users.\n\n**If you'd like the Streamlit team to prioritize this feature request, please use the 👍 (thumbs up emoji) reaction in response to the initial post.**\n\n![Views](https://api.views-badge.org/badge/st-issue-5009)\n","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5009/reactions","total_count":272,"+1":253,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":15,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
