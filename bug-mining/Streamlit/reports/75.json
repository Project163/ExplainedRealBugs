Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nStarting from version 1.22.0 of Streamlit and above, the options in the config.toml file under the [logger] section no longer function. I am currently in the process of upgrading from Streamlit version 1.10.0 to the latest 1.29.0 and have observed that logs cease to display while the application is running. \r\nThe logging level is set to 'Info' in the file, but logs are only appearing from the 'Warning' level and above. Additionally, the formatting doesn't match the configuration file.\r\n\r\nconfig.toml\r\n[logger]\r\nlevel = \"info\"\r\nmessageFormat = \"%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s %(filename)s:%(lineno)-4d - %(message)s\"\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\nlog = logging.getLogger(\"my_tool_logger\")\r\n\r\nst.write(\"Some text of page\")\r\n\r\nlog.info(\"Page loaded\")\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Install streamlit version 1.29.0\r\n2. Insert the following line into the [logger] section of the config.toml file: level = \"info\"\r\n3. Execute the code example I have provided.\"\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nLogs are displayed in the standard output.\r\nhttps://img.serpstat.com/kaisa/2023-12-19_ZFDITjqD.png\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen the logging level is set to 'info,' logs do not appear in the standard output. The message format does not conform to the configuration specified in the 'config.toml' file.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.29.0\r\n- Python version: 3.8\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI tested this on every version from 1.29.0 to 1.21.0, and it appears that it broke starting from version 1.22.0. It worked fine in version 1.21.0.","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7858/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
