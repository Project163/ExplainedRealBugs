What if we did the same thing for small text, e.g. via `st.markdown(\":small[foo]\")`?\n\n### Why?\n\nThis can be used for several cool things:\n\n- Replicate the same styling as widget labels outside of a widget. This is especially helpful if you put a widget and another element next to each other. Today, you can't get the same style as a widget label because `st.markdown` is too big and `st.caption` is gray.\n- Making small badges via `:small[:orange-background[:orange[tag]]]`. \n- Using big and small text in the same element, e.g. for the badges in our [roadmap app](https://roadmap.streamlit.app/). \n\n### How?\n\nJust add a new Markdown extension, similar to the one for colored text. We should make sure all these extensions also work together properly. \n\nPotentially, we could also make `st.caption` simply be `st.markdown(\":small[:gray[foo]]\")` then! Even though today `st.caption` uses a slightly different gray than colored text. \n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"jrieke","id":5103165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDMxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10486/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
