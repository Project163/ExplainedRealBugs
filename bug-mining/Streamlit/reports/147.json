[There used to be](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/e912139a4bddf07dbee2cad48501cbfa92e31e0a/Makefile#L126), but there is not now.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Incorrect information about an error I initially believed was related to this issue, but which I now believe was the result of a file permissions error in the venv; and now that I've resolved that (using `sudo chmod -R 777 .venv`), python-init installs the package fine.</summary>\n  Also: streamlit didn't install. When I type `streamlit` on the command line I get `streamlit: command not found`, and when I type `python -m streamlit` I get `/usr/bin/python: No module named streamlit`. `uv run streamlit hello` gets `error: Failed to spawn: streamlit  Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)`. Edit: however, `cd lib;  uv run python -m streamlit` still works.\n</details>\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: n/a, but I'm on the tip of develop, actually a couple commits past that (to fix another problem)\n- Python version: Python 3.12.3\n- Operating System: Windows 10, WSL2\n- Browser: n/a\n","closed_by":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11725/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
