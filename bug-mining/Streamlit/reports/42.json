Summary\r\n\r\nWhen plotting an Altair plot with date in tooltip, display is incorrect\r\n \r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport altair as alt\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    {\r\n        \"value\": [2, 4, 8, 0],\r\n        \"date_str\": [\"2015-06-01\", \"2015-06-02\", \"2015-06-03\", \"2015-06-04\"],\r\n

)\r\n)\r\nst.altair_chart(altair_chart=chart, use_container_width=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nI expected to see June 4th 2015 and I saw June 3rd 2015.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9583366/151882008-6d9c3980-9961-4500-b951-4a61ae37ea4b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nPlease see above\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\ndon't know.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.5.0\r\n- Python version: 3.9.4\r\n- Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? - No\r\n- OS version: MacOS bigsur\r\n- Browser version: chrome 96.0.4664.55\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI looked into already published issues and I could not find anything related to this.
