One of the first things I noticed when applying to my Streamlit web application, the `page_icon` in the web browser from the `set_page_config` is showing the Streamlit icon instead of showing the selected logo.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.set_page_config(\n    page_title='Buckets',\n    page_icon='🪣',\n    layout='wide',\n    menu_items={\n        'About': 'Test About App'\n    }\n)\n\nst.title('Streamlit Version 1.44.0')\nst.write('Missing page_icon')\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run `hello_world.py` script above\n2. Notice Streamlit icon in the browser tab instead of the Bucket logo\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe icon in the web browser should be the same logo specified from the `page_icon` in the `set_page_config`.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe icon in the web browser is the Streamlit logo instead of the logo specified from the `page_icon` in the `set_page_config`.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.44.0\n- Python version: 3.10.7\n- Operating System: Windows 11 Pro 22631.5039\n- Browser: Google Chrome 122.0.6261.129\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThank you so much for the help!","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10911/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
