Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nHi Streamlit Team and Community,\r\n\r\nI’ve encountered an issue with st.image object when displaying multiple images. From streamlit>=1.40.0, when changing the images width dynamically in st.image object, the images are displayed one in a row, instead of grouping them until it the window width. I attached two screenshots, using streamlit==1.40.2 & streamlit==1.39.0\r\n\r\nVersion 1.40.2\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e186078e-b632-44f4-9256-8514fdd72486)\r\nVersion 1.39.0\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a75dd80e-b34d-4e21-8c5f-41bf1fa2c320)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\noption = st.select_slider(\"Column size\", options=[\"♾️\", \"400px\", \"300px\", \"200px\", \"100px\"])\r\ntry:\r\n   width = int(option[:3])\r\nexcept ValueError:\r\n   width = None\r\n\r\nst.image(urls, caption=descriptions, width=width)\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect that st.image object behaves similar than in streamlit<1.40.0 with multi images\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.40.2\r\n- Python version: 3.11\r\n- Operating System: Linux\r\n- Browser: Google Chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9943/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9943/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
