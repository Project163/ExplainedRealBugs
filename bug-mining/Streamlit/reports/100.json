We should remove \"Did you forget to initialize it?\". That doesn't make a lot of sense for query params (I guess this was copied over from `st.session_state`). \r\n2. The first message should say \"has no attribute\" instead of \"has no key\". We also use that wording for `st.session_state` and `st.secrets`. \r\n\r\n(Btw, maybe it might make sense to generalize the implementation of all dict-like types, so we don't end up with all these subtle differences, see also #10107). \r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.41.0\r\n- Python version:\r\n- Operating System:\r\n- Browser:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10111/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10111/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
