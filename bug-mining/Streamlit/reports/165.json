If you accidentally stopped Streamlit, just restart it in your terminal:\n>\n> streamlit run yourscript.py\n\nHowever, if the message is dismissed, it keeps popping up over and over, preventing a user from viewing the disconnected page.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run any Streamlit app locally.\n2. Open it in a tab.\n3. Stop the server.\n4. Dismiss the connection error. (Repeat ad nauseum)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter the Streamlit server disconnects, the user is warned, and the user dismisses the message to view the disconnected/staled app, the message should not return until the app has reconnected and disconnected again.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe frontend keep trying to reconnect and keeps warning the user over and over.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.47.1\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Operating System: Mac\n- Browser: Prisma\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12113/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
