@rnegronida, thanks for giving it a test. I think the change here is tied to [this change](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9083). When a reconnect happens (which is bound to happen), we do not reset the \"SessionInfo\" which causes this issue. In the past, any reconnect triggered a full rerun, which would ensure the SessionInfo got set correctly. The change only will rerun if it's the first time, or the script was running on disconnect. It was designed to avoid the need to rerun if everything is back, which in theory is a better experience.\r\n\r\nThe two solutions here are:\r\n1. Revert the change and force the rerun on any re-connect.\r\n2. Simply reset the SessionInfo to the previous one.\r\n    a. Similarly, we could just not clear the session info on disconnect and just update it as we get new information.\r\n\r\nI'd love for (2) to work, but I would be nervous for a scenario where the upload went to a different session, and essentially it gets lost in the mix. Will have to think more on
