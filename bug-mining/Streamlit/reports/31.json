Run a Streamlit application on Windows like the above code example\r\n2. Open page on Streamlit\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nImage is displayed, e.g.:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/7438501/e5b87e19-3555-4a5d-9b63-641fe6f9f004)\r\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nImage is not displayed, only alt text is:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/7438501/77fb5c00-a3f6-4daa-a4b4-830f220dd487)\r\n\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.26.0\r\n- Python version: 3.10.12\r\n- Operating System: Windows\r\n- Browser: Edge/Chrome/Firefox (all affected)\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis is likely to be the same issue as #3698, which was closed for inactivity.\r\n\r\nI believe the root cause of this issue is in `streamlit.elements.image.image_to_url()`. Specifically, the function tries to detect whether the input string is a URL or path to a local file. It does this by passing the string to `urllib.parse.urlparse()` and checking the `scheme` attribute:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n    # Strings\r\n    if isinstance(image, str):\r\n        # If it's a url, return it directly.\r\n        try:\r\n            p = urlparse(image)\r\n            if p.scheme:\r\n                return image\r\n        except UnicodeDecodeError:\r\n            # If the string runs into a UnicodeDecodeError, we assume it is not a valid URL.\r\n            pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this code fails to account for, is that on Windows, the \"disk\" part in an absolute path looks a bit like a \"scheme\" to the `urllib.parse.urlparse()` function:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> from urllib.parse import urlparse\r\n>>> urlparse(\"C:\\\\Path\")\r\nParseResult(scheme='c', netloc='', path='\\\\Path', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the function mistakenly assumes that the path is a URL, and embeds this directly into the local HTML of the page, like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<img src=\"C:\\Users\\Me\\image.jpg\" alt=\"0\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Workaround\r\n\r\nYou can work around this issue by providing a relative path instead of an absolute path. For example, applying this workaround to the reproduceable code example above:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nimage_path = Path(__file__).with_name(\"image.jpg\").relative_to(Path.cwd())\r\nst.image(str(image_path))\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7271/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":13,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7271/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
