1)`","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2105657018/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yanivkrol","id":130914260,"node_id":"U_kgDOB82X1A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130914260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol","html_url":"https://github.com/yanivkrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12776089237,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs6IVcxZzwAAAAL5g6aV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/12776089237","actor":{"login":"yanivkrol","id":130914260,"node_id":"U_kgDOB82X1A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130914260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol","html_url":"https://github.com/yanivkrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-11T09:48:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12776089241,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs6IVcxZzwAAAAL5g6aZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/12776089241","actor":{"login":"yanivkrol","id":130914260,"node_id":"U_kgDOB82X1A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130914260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol","html_url":"https://github.com/yanivkrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanivkrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-11T09:48:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12776089998,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs6IVcxZzwAAAAL5g6mO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/12776089998","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-11T09:49:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12776090004,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs6IVcxZzwAAAAL5g6mU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamli

Save the provided code in a file named `streamlit_cache_bug.py`.\r\n\r\n2. Create two virtual environments:\r\n   - One with Streamlit 1.37.0\r\n   - Another with Streamlit 1.38.0 or later\r\n\r\n3. Run the script in Streamlit 1.37.0:\r\n   - Enter a category (e.g., \"users\") and click \"Fetch Data\". It takes ~2 seconds.\r\n   - Click \"Fetch Data\" again with the same category. It's instant (cached).\r\n   - Change the category (e.g., to \"products\") and click \"Fetch Data\". It takes ~2 seconds again.\r\n   - Click \"Clear Cache\", then \"Fetch Data\" with any category. It takes ~2 seconds, showing the cache was cleared for all categories.\r\n\r\n4. Run the same script in Streamlit 1.38.0 or later:\r\n   - Repeat the steps above.\r\n   - After clicking \"Clear Cache\", then \"Fetch Data\", it might still be instant for previously used categories, indicating the cache was not fully cleared.\r\n\r\n5. Observe the difference in behavior between the two versions:\r\n   - In 1.37.0, the cache is fully cleared for all categories.\r\n   - In 1.38.0 and later, the cache might not be fully cleared, with some categories still returning cached results.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe cache should be cleared entirely when calling clear() on a cached class method, resulting in a ~2 second fetch time for all categories after clearing, regardless of whether they were previously cached.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Streamlit 1.38.0 and later, calling clear() on a cached class method does not clear the entire cache. Previously cached categories may still return instant results after clearing, indicating that the cache was not fully cleared.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\nStreamlit version: 1.38.0 (and later versions)\r\nPython version: 3.11\r\nOperating System: MacOS 14.7\r\nBrowser: Version 129.0.6668.90\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to be caused by changes in how the cache key is calculated. In 1.38.0 and later, the class instance (self) is passed to the clear() method and used to calculate a key, even when it should be ignored due to the underscore prefix in the method signature.\r\n\r\nThis breaking change prevents upgrading to newer Streamlit versions for projects that rely on clearing the entire cache for class methods.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs and Issues:\r\n\r\nPR: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9101\r\nIssue: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8638","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9633/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15987826832,"node_id":"REFE_lADODCoeTs6IVcxZzwAAAAO48uCQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/15987826832","actor":{"login":"edegp","id":86155082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MTU1MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86155082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp","html_url":"https://github.com/edegp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edegp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0dd29344b28983b6811c0ce763a041f10d6808da","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/edegp/streamlit/commits/0dd29344b28983b6811c0ce763a041f10d6808da","created_at":"2025-01-19T04:36:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19986602761,"node_id":"REFE_lADODCoeTs6IVcxZzwAAAASnS1sJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/19986602761","actor":{"login":"asmeralt","id":544010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/544010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt","html_url":"https://github.com/asmeralt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmeralt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"48cdca17b641a4dd6768b388c9522a5fbdc5d3e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asmeralt/streamlit/commits/48cdca17b641a4dd6768b388c9522a5fbdc5d3e9","created_at":"2025-09-29T14:56:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
