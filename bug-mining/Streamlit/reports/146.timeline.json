@sfc-gh-lwilby ,\n\nI try to build a kind of a tile with st.container. I thought that if I give the container the key attribute, I would be able to use some CSS on it, in order to change the background color for example. It seems that not only the container does not get the CSS class, some of the wdgets behave the same way. That is just what I didn't expect. So in order to select the container I would have to select its content using the class from the key attribute, select its parent and select its parent. From what I know about CSS is it is easier to get to the children that to n parents above. \n\nBest

@alex-bork , \n\nI think I see the issue you are having when running your code and adding the background style onto the element with the CSS class. There is a difference in size between the `stVerticalBlockBorderWrapper` and the `stVerticalBlock` so for the background colour applying it to `stVerticalBlock` is not adequate. Does this fully describe the issue? What other widgets are you working with?\n\nLaura","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2707622003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16638648424,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs6s_b-YzwAAAAPfvaBo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/16638648424","actor":{"login":"alex-bork","id":100121698,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfe8Yg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100121698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-bork","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-07T22:35:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16638648433,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs6s_b-YzwAAAAPfvaBx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/16638648433","actor":{"login":"alex-bork","id":100121698,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfe8Yg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100121698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-bork","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-07T22:35:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2709621840","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10674#issuecomment-2709621840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10674","id":2709621840,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs6hgYxQ","user":{"login":"alex-bork","id":100121698,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfe8Yg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100121698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-bork","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bork/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"20

Is that possible?\n> \n> Best Regards Alex\n\nHi Alex, \n\nI think there are two conversations going on here and I want to separate them out for clarity. \n\n1) It sounds like here you are looking for help with applying the styles on your app. I think it would be better for this type of question to post in the community forum https://discuss.streamlit.io/ where there are many community members that can help. Based on the investigation I did, I would try to grab the `stVerticalBlockBorderWrapper`, probably by traversing to the parent like you suggested previously. \n\n2) Potentially a gap/bug in the advanced theming implementation. For this, can you let me know if I am describing your issue correctly above? Also, if you are having the same issue with other widgets, can you let me know which ones? I am planning on checking with the team on whether it is feasible to move these class definitions.
