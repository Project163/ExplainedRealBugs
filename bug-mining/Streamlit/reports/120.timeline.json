[@pr3d4t0r](https://github.com/pr3d4t0r) Are you on windows by chance? I just tried reproducing this issue, and I do not see anything.\n\nHowdy!\n\nNot on Windows, and this is a Python library issue.  Aside from the environments I listed in the Streamlit.io discussion board, here's the OS information:\n\n- Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS with Firefox 138.0.1\n- macOS Sequoia 15.4.1 with:\n  - Firefox 138.0.1\n  - LibreWolf 138.0.1\n  - Brave 1.78.94\n  - Safari 18.4\n \nThe issue is reproducible in macOS and Streamlit.app / Community cloud:\n\n  a. FAILS: https://ssscore-bert.streamlit.app/ - Uses Streamlit 1.45.0\n  b. WORKS: https://ssscore.streamlit.app/ - Uses Streamlit 1.44.1\n\nThe evidence points at an issue with the Streamlit 1.45.0 build.  The release notes indicate that someone updated `st.file_uploader()` for this release.\n\nFor full details on how to reproduce, see my ticket in the Streamlit forums:  https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/bug-in-st-file-uploader-type-csv-for-streamlit-version-1-45-0/111379\n\nTake care and

It is uppercase extensions that appear to cause the issue. It can be reproduced with just this code:\n> \n> st.file_uploader(\"Upload\", type=\"TXT\")\n> \n> You can upload a file named `test.txt`, but trying to upload `test.TXT` will raise:\n> \n> ```\n> streamlit.errors.StreamlitAPIException: Invalid file extension: .txt. Allowed: ['.txt']\n> ```\n> \n> Note that the `type` parameter seems to be case-insensitive (`type=\"txt\"` behaves the same), but the case in the file name matters.\n> \n> Tested locally (arch, python 3.13) and streamlit cloud (python 3.12)\n\nThanks, good sleuthing.\n\nI suspected something like this was the issue, that's why I defined `type=[ 'CSV', 'csv', ]` for `file_uploader()` - it has no effect.\n\nIf it helps, my use case processes files from three different models of GPS devices from at least two different vendors.  Files are stored in a case-insensitve FAT file system SD card.  The files are UTF-8 encoded, nothing fancy, comma-separated.  They are moved from the GPS device to the local file system (APFS, ext3, whatever Windows uses, etc.) and from there to the SSScore application on Streamlit.app.  I double-checked, no meta-data is added during the copy between FAT and the UNIX-like file systems.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2848356690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pr3d4t0r","id":148262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODI2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r","html_url":"https://github.com/pr3d4t0r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pr3d4t0r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
