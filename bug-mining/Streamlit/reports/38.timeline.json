#7046\r\n\r\nWhile the custom component is loaded, we show the loading skeleton. Following changes are made in this PR:\r\n1. the warning component will be shown after 60s instead of 3s to make it less disruptive in case of slower loading times\r\n2. after 15s, a console warning is shown in the browser's DevTools as a soft-warning for the developer\r\n3. the warning texts are modified slightly and are now different based on whether a `url` is provided (usually dev mode) or not\r\n4. the existing class component is re-written as a functional component. Since I had to touch the component anyways, I thought it's a good idea to refactor it using the newer React style and make the changes then\r\n5. Add a couple of more tests for some convenient methods that now live in its own file `componentUtils.ts`\r\n6. Add a couple of more types. As a future note: most types are also defined in the `component-lib/` module and we could think about creating a shared module so that we do not duplicate the typing etc. However, I consider this to be out of scope for this PR.\r\n7. The loading skeleton will mimic the same height if we infer from the custom component provides a height value.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Screenshot of warning messages</summary>\r\n<img

Thanks for getting to us. We have merged a fix to this, and it will be in the next release hopefully in the next day or so.\r\n\r\nJust want to let you know that the end state should mimic the same behavior as before. The only difference you might notice is the time period _before_ your custom component is loaded, we will display a \"skeleton\". The skeleton will disappear and collapse down for the message passing. You can bypass this by sending down a `height` parameter to inform the system the height the component intends to be, so the loading skeleton matches the size and look seamless. So for the message passer you can send a height = 0, which will never display the loading skeleton in the first place. Similarly, the sheet itself can have a larger size if you know what it is before.\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any more questions, but I thank you for your patience in this!","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/1996270028/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12111305496,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs6CFYwYzwAAAALR49sY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/12111305496","actor":{"login":"naterush","id":21002431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDAyNDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21002431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush","html_url":"https://github.com/naterush","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-14T02:18:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12111305500,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs6CFYwYzwAAAALR49sc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/12111305500","actor":{"login":"naterush","id":21002431,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDAyNDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21002431?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush","html_url":"https://github.com/naterush","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naterush/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-14T02:18:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12111329713,"node_id":"REFE_lADODCoeTs6CFYwYzwAAAALR5Dmx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/12111329713","actor":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d0574a9c1220ebc762353ec1885e9d7b67c434f6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/commits/d0574a9c1220ebc762353ec1885e9d7b67c434f6","created_at":"2024-03-14T02:23:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":124
