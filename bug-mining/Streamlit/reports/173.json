Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen using st.audio_input, if you record audio, stop recording, seek to a position in the playback, then start a new recording, the waveform visualization retains the playback colors splitting at where the playhead was.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.title(\"Audio Input Color Bug Demo\")\n\n# Any audio input widget will exhibit this behavior\naudio = st.audio_input(\"Record some audio\")\n\nif audio:\n    st.audio(audio)\n    st.success(\"Audio recorded successfully!\")\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run the app with streamlit run app.py\n2. Click the record button and record a few seconds of audio\n3. Click stop recording\n4. Click anywhere on the waveform to seek to that position (this pauses playback)\n5. Click the record button again to start a new recording\n6. Observe that the waveform bars are not the correct colors\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen starting a new recording (step 5), the waveform visualization should immediately change to the primary theme color  to indicate that recording is active, regardless of the previous state.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n<img width=\"836\" height=\"217\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2e29313-cef2-4295-8edc-f45335621151\" />\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n  - Streamlit version: Latest develop branch\n  - Python version: 3.11\n  - Operating System: macOS\n  - Browser: Chrome, Safari (issue occurs in both)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12446/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
