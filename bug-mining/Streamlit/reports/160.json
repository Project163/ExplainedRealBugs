This leads to wrong assignments of `color` and column names appear in the legend in wrong order.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n# line_chart_bug.py\nimport streamlit as st\n\nchart_data = {'c_one': [1, 1, 1], 'b_two': [2, 2, 2], 'a_three': [3, 3, 3]}\nst.line_chart(\n    chart_data, \n    y=['c_one', 'b_two', 'a_three'], \n    color=[(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255)]\n)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n$ streamlit run line_chart_bug.py\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nkwarg `y` should determine the order of columns in the plot and when omitted/None, columns should be plotted in the same order as the column index.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n- Legend shows columns in wrong order: \"a_three\", ... which depends entirely on column names, not the order of the sequence `y`\n- Colors in `color` are assigned to the wrong lines: \"c_one\" should be red not blue.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.39 ... 1.47.1 (all tested)\n- pandas 2.2.3\n- Python version: 3.12.7\n- Operating System: ubuntu 24.04\n- Browser: chrome-based\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nTemporary workaround: you can modify the column order by prepending column names with spaces.","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12071/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
