After upgrading my streamlit dependency from 1.41.1 -> 1.42.0 I started receiving a high rate of exception reports from end users. See the stack trace below showing `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'.`.\n\nLooking at the streamlit repo, I see the line causing the exception was introduced in 1.42.0.\n\nhttps://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/54c7a880c46a67b2a8ed1cfe7c10492f97135ffb/lib/streamlit/web/bootstrap.py#L344\n\nI have pinned aider to use 1.41.1 for now, but wanted to make you aware.\n\nHere is the main [aider issue](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/3221) where these exceptions have been reported. It is linked with a dozen or more other issues reporting the same problem.\n\n```\n    cli.main(st_args)\n  File \"core.py\", line 1161, in __call__\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"core.py\", line 1082, in main\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"core.py\", line 1697, in invoke\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\n                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"core.py\", line 1443, in invoke\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"core.py\", line 788, in invoke\n    return __callback(*args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"cli.py\", line 240, in main_run\n    _main_run(target, args, flag_options=kwargs)\n  File \"cli.py\", line 276, in _main_run\n    bootstrap.run(file, is_hello, args, flag_options)\n  File \"bootstrap.py\", line 344, in run\n    if asyncio.get_event_loop().is_running():\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"events.py\", line 702, in get_event_loop\n    raise RuntimeError('There is no current event loop in thread %r.'\nRuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'.\n```\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nI have no ability to reproduce.
