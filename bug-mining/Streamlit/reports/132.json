as st\n\nclass Status(str, enum.Enum):\n    success = \"Success status\"\n    running = \"Running status\"\n    error = \"Error status\"\n\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\"pipeline\": [\"Success\", \"Error\", \"Running\"], \"status\": [Status.success, Status.error, Status.running]}\n)\n\n\ndef status_highlight(value: Status):\n    color = \"\"\n    match value:\n        case Status.error:\n
