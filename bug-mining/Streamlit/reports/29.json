the date_input simply takes the start date of the date range and defaults to a signle date picker.\r\n\r\nSetting the same date range via the _value_ keyword works (i.e. the widget renders with the last 30 days date range and allows users to provide a range) but this is not what I'm after.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to avoid setting the value via both the session_state and _value_ keyword to avoid getting _The widget with key “xxx” was created with a default value but also had its value set via the Session State API_ warnings as per the documentation [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/session-state#forms-and-callbacks).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\r\n\r\ntoday = date.today()\r\ntoday_minus_30 = today -
