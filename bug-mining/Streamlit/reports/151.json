But in the [mega tester app](https://mega-tester.streamlit.app/), it's hidden if the sidebar is expanded. \n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Just start a basic Streamlit app or go to the [mega tester app](https://mega-tester.streamlit.app/). \n2. Expand the sidebar\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTop bar has white background. \n\n### Current Behavior\n\nTop bar has no background, which makes the toolbar buttons overlap the content: \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69a2cac5-146e-48a9-b40e-feabd8a39d72)\n\nNote that a) the top bar has a white background if the sidebar is collapsed (probably because of `st.logo`) and b) the top bar should not have a white background if it doesn't contain anything (e.g. if there's no `st.logo`, no sidebar, the app menu and toolbar buttons are hidden via config options or the embed parameter). \n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.46\n- Python version:\n- Operating System:\n- Browser:\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11785/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
