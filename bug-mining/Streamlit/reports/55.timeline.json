Describe your changes\r\n\r\nCloses #8629\r\n\r\nWhen Streamlit is started via `server.headless=true`, the address output does not contain `localhost`, although the server can still be reached via `localhost`. The `headless` mode just defines whether a browser is started, not what the address binding is. So, the idea is to show `localhost` also in case when  `server.headless=true` is set.\r\n\r\nOutput before:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n2024-05-13 11:50:29.589 DEBUG   streamlit.runtime.runtime: Runtime state:
