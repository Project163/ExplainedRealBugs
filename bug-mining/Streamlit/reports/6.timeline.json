Do you mean the `options` argument?\r\n\r\n`Collection` seems reasonable.

considering it this morning, I think the fact that we now call the indexing function with different values is correct. Previously it would only be called for handling the default values during the first widget initialization, and so wasn't called with the values that reflect the widget's changed state, but there is nothing fundamentally different happening now, and the bug happening here could have just as easily been triggered on the first run by explicitly including default options in the widget creation.\r\n\r\nSo the fix should be to more robustly ensure the `options` value supports the operations we need. Our `ensure_iterable` function is not quite enough, because iterability does not imply indexability, so we need to also convert it to something indexable first.

#3505. Technically that issue is resolved by #3501, but the same\r\nproblem can happen for several other widgets that take options, so it is\r\nworth applying a fix more broadly.\r\n\r\nWe already ensure the options are iterable, but this is not sufficient\r\nfor all of our needs, because we sometimes need to look up an index of a\r\nvalue, which requires a `Sequence`. Additionally, users sometimes pass\r\nin types that were not included in the existing list of supported types,\r\nand we would like to more precisely define the requirements we have on\r\ntypes and ensure our code can handle them.\r\n\r\nWidgets now accept any `Collection` for an options parameter, because\r\nthe required iterability means we can fall back to turning it into a\r\nlist if it does not support the desired `index` operation. This should\r\nwork for nearly all types, though it is possible that some will require\r\nspecial handling like Pandas DataFrames. (Do dataframes actually count\r\nas `Collection`s? If not, the type annotation added here should be\r\nextended to union with them)\r\n\r\nTo make mypy cooperate with some added type annotations, one of the\r\nlocals in the widgets has been renamed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4996521534,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDk5NjUyMTUzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/4996521534","actor":{"login":"AnOctopus","id":7356217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTYyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7356217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus","html_url":"https://github.com/AnOctopus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T18:18:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4996521760,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ5OTY1MjE3NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/4996521760","actor":{"login":"AnOctopus","id":7356217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTYyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7356217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus","html_url":"https://github.com/AnOctopus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b90e7df27f778d6ac958a425523381de1c66bb9a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/commits/b90e7df27f778d6ac958a425523381de1c66bb9a","created_at":"2021-07-08T18:18:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5027981096,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUwMjc5ODEwOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/5027981096","actor":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8d768cb301e024850d925e8b730cd679d94348e5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vdonato/streamlit/commits/8d768cb301e024850d925e8b730cd679d94348e5","created_at":"2021-07-15T22:17:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
