Problem\n\nWhen navigating the options of a `st.selectbox` widget using the arrow keys (↑↓), the dropdown does not scroll up/down along with the option in focus.\n\nThis is only noticeable when there are 9 or more options to select from.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Preferred solution:** Dropdown scrolls up/down along with option in focus, when navigating with arrow keys (↑↓)\n\n### Additional context\n\nFrom the user's perspective, if you don't see what option is in focus, you don't know when to stop scrolling (in this scenario, hitting up/down arrow keys).\n\n---\n\nCommunity voting on

Summary\n\n- When using the `st.selectbox`, you cannot highlight the text of the current selection and delete it at once (e.g., using backspace key).\n- Sometimes it lets you highlight the selection text, but only when `st.selectbox` is not in focus (so backspace key doesn't do anything).\n- This means users are only able to delete any selection letter by letter.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n[![Open in Streamlit Cloud](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/?issue=gh-5240)\n\nCode snippet:\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nst.selectbox('Example options',options = ('option 1','option 2','option 3'))\n```\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nThe current selection text in `st.selectbox` can be highlighted while in focus (and e.g., deleted at once using backspace key). \n\n### Is this a regression?\n\nNo\n\n### Additional information\n\nThis is one of several UX issues detected for `st.selectbox`. Others are:\n\n- #4671 \n- #4901 \n\n---\n\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are most important to our users.\n\n**If you'd like the

Problem\n\n`st.selectbox` is one of the most widely used Streamlit widgets, as it allows the user to select one option from a list of options. \n\nThe current implementation allows **text searching**, which for some use cases makes sense (e.g., a long list of countries), but for others it makes the widget feel buggy (e.g., a selectbox with very few options, such as \"Yes, No\").\n\n### Solution\n\n**MVP:** An example on how to use the CSS st.markdown trick to disable text search in `st.selectbox`.\n\n**Preferred solution:** A parameter that allows enabling/disabling the text search behavior in `st.selectbox`.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis is one of several UX issues detected for st.selectbox. Others are:\n\n- #4671 \n- #4901 \n- #5240 \n\n---\n\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are most important to our users.\n\n**If you'd like the Streamlit team to prioritize this feature request, please use the 👍 (thumbs up emoji) reaction in response to the initial post.**\n\n![Views](https://api.views-badge.org/badge/st-issue-6160)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6160/reactions","total_count":32,"+1":32,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/1786306179","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4901#issuecomment-1786306179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4901","id":1786306179,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs5qeN6D","user":{"login":"RichardHruby","id":44926683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTI2Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44926683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby","html_url":"https://github.com/RichardHruby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RichardHruby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-31T01:46:32Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T01:46:32Z","body":"+1 here.

🔴 Related Issue Number\r\n\r\n- Resolved: #5\r\n\r\n## 💡 Work Description\r\n\r\n- Streamlit의 Selectbox를 통해 Train data 및 bbox 시각화\r\n    - 시각화를 위해 PIL을 사용했습니다. (matplotlib.pyplot는 넘어가는 속도가 느립니다.) 따라서 올바르게 Bbox를 출력하기 위해 arial.ttf 폰트가 필요합니다.\r\n        - src 파일에 업로드 해두었으니 해당하는 위치에 해당하는 코드로 변경하셔야 합니다.\r\n- Streamlit의 Sidebar에 data augmentation 기능 추가 (Horizontal / Vertical Flip, Rotate, Random Crop, RandomBrightnessContrast, HueSaturationValue, GaussNoise)\r\n- 이미지 별 Annotation count 추가 및 시각화 (pie plot)\r\n\r\n## 📷 Screenshot\r\n\r\n<!-- 구현한 기능을 보여주는 스크린샷을 넣어주세요. \"\" 안에 이미지 url을 넣어주세요. 없으면 지워주세요. -->\r\n\r\n| 기능 | 스크린샷 |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| Train data, bbox 시각화 및 data augmentation 기능 추가 | <img src = \"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e0b28fb-89ca-4ab4-a372-7a93a579886a\" width =\"1000\"> |\r\n| data augmentation 기능 및 데이터 넘기기 기능 추가 | <img src = \"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7063c266-8465-47c4-b680-af5f86d3b8c6\" width =\"1000\">  |\r\n\r\n## 📖 Reference\r\n\r\n- albumentations bbox_params 참고 : [https://albumentations.ai/docs/getting_started/bounding_boxes_augmentation/](https://albumentations.ai/docs/getting_started/bounding_boxes_augmentation/)\r\n- Albumentations PyTorch : [https://albumentations.ai/docs/examples/pytorch_classification/](https://albumentations.ai/docs/examples/pytorch_classification/)\r\n- streamlit : [https://docs.streamlit.io/](https://docs.streamlit.io/), 강의자료 : AI 개발 기초 03. Streamlit을 활용한 웹 프로토타입 구현하기\r\n\r\n\r\n## 👥 To Reviewers\r\n\r\n- select box의 드롭 다운을 맨 위가 아닌 마지막으로 선택한 옵션에 위치하도록 설정하고 싶었는데 아직 해당 기능이 streamlit에 없는 것 같습니다.  (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4901)\r\n- 따라서 이전 이미지, 다음 이미지를 볼 수 있게 버튼을 제작했는데, 이 버튼이 select box와 충돌이 있어 기능이 미흡합니다. (동작은 합니다.) bug issue를 따로 생성해서 작업하도록 하겠습니다.\r\n- 그 외에도 augmentation 기능에 사소한 bug들이 있습니다. 이것 역시 bug issue를 통해 해결하겠습니다.\r\n\r\n## 🚧 Uncompleted Tasks\r\n\r\n- 이번 PR에서 아직 완료되지 않은 작업이 있다면 적어주세요. 없다면 `N/A`로 남겨주세요.\r\n    -  augmentation bug 수정\r\n    -  이미지 넘기기 기능 bug 수정\r\n\r\n## ✅ Checklists\r\n\r\n- [x]  깃 컨벤션 및 팀 규칙에 맞게 작성되었나요?\r\n- [x]  불필요한 코드 및 주석이나 디버깅 코드는 제거되었나요?\r\n- [x]  기능이 동작하는지

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nWhen you click on a selectbox (or multiselect), scroll in the dropdown, then close it and click on the selectbox again, the dropdown opens at the top position. This can be annoying if the dropdown is large. With this PR, the dropdown will open at the same position where it was previously closed. Also, when the dropdown opens for the first time, it opens at the position of the selected default value.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b361fb1-0e0d-47db-b627-5391455a2228\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ca577a-d78e-43fb-8a26-11ec56003638\r\n\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\nCloses #4901\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Added a JS unit test on the `Selectbox` component that simulates scrolling, closes the dropdown, and checks that it opens at the same position. \r\n- Did not add an e2e test because it would basically do the same thing and that feels a bit overkill. But I can add e2e test for `st.selectbox` and `st.multiselect` if we want to have them. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10073/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2599484311","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4901#issuecomment-2599484311","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4901","id":2599484311,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs6a8PuX","user":{"login":"jrieke","id":5103165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDMxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-18T02:44:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-18T02:44:24Z","body":"Hey, I'm working on a PR for this, see the link above.
