@hyerrakalva, wanted to give you an update on this (sorry for the delay!). I ran this by our product team, and our gut feeling is that we'll probably want to have password fields be configurable so a developer can specify whether the password is a new or existing one. Ideally, we'd want the default to be that it's treated as an existing password since that's certainly the more common use case, but we'll most likely have to default to the current behavior to preserve backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nWe'll try to get a spec for this out sometime next week, at which point it'll be free to take if you still want to work on

@tvst what do folks think about generally having an `options` param for all input widgets that lets you customize css, attributes, etc. This is the pattern [Rails uses](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.1.7/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-password_field). So essentially for this case, one could do something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsender_password = st.text_input('password', type='password', key='password', html_options={\"autocomplete\": \"current-password\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also think we should just default it to being specified, but to future-proof the possibility of other HTML attributes in the future, seems useful to have this kind of flexibility.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/827070839/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroes","id":27847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes","html_url":"https://github.com/jroes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4646752723,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY0Njc1MjcyMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/4646752723","actor":{"login":"tvst","id":690814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDgxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/690814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst","html_url":"https://github.com/tvst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-26T18:56:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4646752729,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2NDY3NTI3Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/4646752729","actor":{"login":"tvst","id":690814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MDgxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/690814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst","html_url":"https://github.com/tvst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-26T18:56:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4646752732,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY0Njc1MjczMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/4646752732","actor":{"login":"asaini","id":1134064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQwNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini","html_url":"https://github.com/asaini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-26T18:56:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4646752736,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2NDY3NTI3MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/4646752736","actor":{"login":"asaini","id":1134064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQwNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/
