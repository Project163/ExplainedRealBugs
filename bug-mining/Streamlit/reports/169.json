Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\n#10166 added a date range quick select drop down to `st.date_input()` which uses [BaseWeb's stateful quick select datepicker](https://baseweb.design/ladle/?story=datepicker--stateful-quick-select). That component returns JavaScript `Date` instances anchored at [12:00:00](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/blob/7190c45a00d794f616cc22f520634523c2fbb1bc/src/datepicker/calendar.tsx#L555) (midday).\n\nThis means the `st.date_input()` date validation introduced in #10764 incorrectly warns the date ranges inputted by the quick select drop down (Past Week, Past Month...) has an invalid upper date when `st.date_input()` is called with `max_value=datetime.now().date()`, because today 12:00 (BaseWeb Date) > today 00:00 (Streamlit `max_date`).\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport datetime\nimport streamlit as st\n\ntoday = datetime.datetime.now().date()\nmin_date = today - datetime.timedelta(days=800)\nmin_date, today\n\nd = st.date_input(\n    \"Input date range\",\n    value=(min_date, today),\n    min_value=min_date,\n    max_value=today,\n    format=\"MM.DD.YYYY\",\n)\nd\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/179b9f1d-a96b-430e-a3d8-f0bf57a043d4\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA way to fix this would be to change the `Date` objects returned by BaseWeb quick select by stripping the 12:00 time component to just 00:00.\n\nI.e. put operations like this: `dateObject.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);` into https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/frontend/lib/src/components/widgets/DateInput/DateInput.tsx\n\nThis would mean the validation introduced by #10764 would always be making 00:00 `Date` comparisons, and the quick select date ranges would pass validation correctly when `st.date_input(..., max_value=datetime.now().date(), ...)`.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nSee vid\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.48.1\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Operating System: Linux\n- Browser: Chrome\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12293/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
