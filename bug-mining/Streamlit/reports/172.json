Note the `.mjs` file extension in contrast to `.js` extensions of the other scripts. Only sometimes an error message is rendered.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.pdf(\"https://pdfobject.com/pdf/sample.pdf\")\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRun the above example.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe PDF is being rendered normally.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nError message in Chrome console:\n```\nFailed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of \"text/plain\". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.\n```\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: streamlit[pdf] v1.49.1\n- Python version: 1.13.6\n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Browser: tested on Chrome, Edge and Firefox\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nRelated to #10004 which got fixed by #10010, however this fix does not include the `.mjs` file extension. I will try to implement a fix myself in the future and can create a pull request.","closed_by":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12387/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
