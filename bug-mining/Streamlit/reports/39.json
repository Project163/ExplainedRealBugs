Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\r\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nNormally, the \"View fullscreen\" button appears like this:\r\n![CleanShot 2023-07-12 at 23 47 10@2x](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/3135397/ed0d493d-8d3b-4fc2-8ab0-d32338db91a5)\r\n\r\nHowever, in some window width, it goes outside the parent width making the page wider than the window and the horizontal scrollbar appears.\r\n![CleanShot 2023-07-12 at 23 47 44@2x](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/3135397/1ae1714d-e713-4fc0-932d-ca1a5a7d565e)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSimilar to #6303\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n[![Open in Streamlit Cloud](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/?issue=gh-6990)\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nst.image(\"https://streamlit.io/images/brand/streamlit-logo-secondary-colormark-darktext.png\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nProbably, the breakpoint should be set correctly so that the main area shrinks early and its margin is kept enough with any window width.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.24.0\r\n- Python version: 3.9.2\r\n- Operating System: macOS Ventura 13.4.1\r\n- Browser: Google Chrome Version 114.0.5735.198 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis problem becomes more noticeable when the app is embedded in an iframe and it is managed with [iframe-resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer) like the HTML page below:\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\r\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\r\n    <title>Document</title>\r\n    <style>\r\n        html, body {\r\n            margin: 0;\r\n            padding: 0;\r\n            width: 100%;\r\n            height: 100%;\r\n        }\r\n        #app {\r\n            width: 100%;\r\n            height: 100%;\r\n        }\r\n    </style>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <iframe id=\"app\" src=\"http://localhost:8501?embed=true\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/iframe-resizer@4.3.6/js/iframeResizer.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script>\r\n    iFrameResize({ log: true }, '#app')\r\n    </script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-07-12 at 23 55

When the cursor hovers on the image, the fullscreen button appears outside the frame, which makes the page wider.\r\n2. The horizontal scrollbar appears.\r\n3. It makes the height of the visible area of the iframe shrunk so that it's smaller than the child page height.\r\n4. The vertical scrollbar appears.\r\n5. It makes the width of the visible area of the iframe shrunk, then the child page width is also made smaller.\r\n\r\nThe situation becomes even worse when there are multiple image components with the fullscreen button as the flow described above on each component resonates and the page shakes.\r\n![embedded-streamlit-shaking](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/3135397/6999e050-1ab1-48cc-bd80-d1c5a95ce865)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6990/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
