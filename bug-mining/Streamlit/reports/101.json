Go to https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text/st.code\n2. make sure the code block is not in the current viewport:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/755169e2-584a-45b9-84f9-212fa312bc23)\n\n3. Scroll down to see what's going on.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8789d732-b3db-4761-b76f-2cebced794b0)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn Chrome, the browser remembers the scroll position, so just reload, and the code block will diplay correctly as it is in the viewport now.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e30e4dff-7557-4247-b656-a2c5d747d61f)\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n`st.code` is not displayed correctly if the code block is not in the viewport when the page loads.\n\nIt shows:\n\n```py\n[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]\n```\n\nthe copy function is correct.\n```py\ndef hello():\n    print(\"Hello, Streamlit!\")\n```\n\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.41.1\n- Python version: \n- Operating System: Windows 10 \n- Browser: Chrome\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10231/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
