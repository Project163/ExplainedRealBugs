When the `st.data_editor` infers the datatype of the column from the data passed to it, it sees only integer values and incorrectly assumes an integer column. This prevents the user from typing a decimal sign in the second run.\n\nAdding a `NumberColumn` config with a float format does not help.\n\n\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport streamlit as st\n\n\ndef btn_on_click():\n    st.session_state.df_input = df_result\n\n\nst.session_state.setdefault('df_input', pd.DataFrame(data=[None, None], columns=['number']))\n\ndf_result = st.data_editor(\n    st.session_state.df_input,\n    column_config={'number': st.column_config.NumberColumn(format='%.1f')},\n)\n\nst.button('store df to session state', on_click=btn_on_click)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Type integer values into the two fields of the data editor.\n_Note, that at this point you are still able to input float values!_\n2. With the integer values in the data editor, hit the button\n3. Now try to input float values.\n_The data editor does not accept the decimal..._\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect, that the `st.data_editor` returns a dataframe with floats if the column config defines a float format.\n\nAt minimum there should be a way to force a column to be considered a float column.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe `st.data_editor` incorrectly returns a dataframe with int values and therefore infers the wrong datatype on the second run.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.49.1\n- Python version: 3.11.9\n- Operating System: Microsoft Windows 11 Enterprise, Version 23H2, OS build 22631.5909\n- Browser: Microsoft Edge, Version 141.0.3537.57\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nA possible workaround is to add a type conversion to the callback function:\n\n```\ndef btn_on_click():\n    st.session_state.df_input = df_result.astype({'number': 'float'})\n```","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-dmatthews","id":135349133,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBFDjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135349133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-dmatthews","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12745/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
