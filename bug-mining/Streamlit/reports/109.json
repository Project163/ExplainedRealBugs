Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\r\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nWhen the mouse wheel is used to scroll down a page, sometimes as an unintended side-effect the value of recently selected numeric widgets also changes. Consequently, the values entered by users are unintentionally modified when the user scrolls around the page!\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nst.title(\"Demo of scrolling issue\")\r\n\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    # Add empty vertical space, to make the page scrollable\r\n    st.write(\".\")\r\n\r\nnum = st.number_input(\"Enter a number\", value=0.0)\r\n\r\nfor i in range(50):\r\n    st.write(\".\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Select the numerical input widget by clicking it, and leave the mouse cursor over the widget\r\n2. Enter a value with the keyboard (e.g. `1.0`) and press Enter\r\n3. Scroll down the page with the mouse wheel\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe widget's numerical value should stay unchanged when the page is scrolled.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen one scrolls down the page, the widget's value changes from `1.0` to `0.99`!\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.35.0\r\n- Python version: 3.10.14\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu\r\n- Browser: Edge\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis scroll issue is more likely to occur on streamlit pages with a large number of number_input widgets, in which users are more likely to scroll up and down and accidentally modify the values.\r\n \r\nI found a previous forum message about this from two years ago, which unfortunately didn't seem to have been answered: https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/st-number-input-changes-its-value-with-mouse-wheel/20694\r\n\r\nRecording of the example above:\r\n\r\n[scroll_issue_3.webm](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/71127464/9914916b-756f-4d3d-89c1-f7d6a7684170)","closed_by":{"login":"mayagbarnes","id":63436329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDM2MzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63436329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes","html_url":"https://github.com/mayagbarnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayagbarnes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8867/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
