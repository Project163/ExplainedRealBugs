Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen `options` contains a repeated string, the drop-down menu shows overlapping options.\n\n<img width=\"812\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5947102f-e090-4358-a6f3-7e3540767846\" />\n\n<img width=\"788\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8983648f-54ee-441d-ba7a-5c11f6c00d42\" />\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nselections = st.multiselect(\"C\", accept_new_options=True, options=[\"aa\", \"Aa\", \"aA\", \"aA\"])\n\nselections\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run the app.\n2. In the widget, start typing \"a\" to see the overlap.\n3. Type another letter \"b\" to eliminate all existing matches and still see the overlap.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo options should overlap in the menu.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThere is a visual defect where options overlap.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.44.2.dev20250424\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Operating System: Mac\n- Browser: Prisma\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11215/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
