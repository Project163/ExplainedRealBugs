Request a path against a streamlit server version 1.39.0 with the format `{server_hostname}//{redirect_hostname}/`, eg (http://localhost:8501//authorization.site/)\r\n2. Observe the redirect to the redirect_hostname\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected behavior is for the server to return a 403 Forbidden response, and this was the behavior in streamlit release version `1.38.0`\r\nExample Request for Streamlit 1.38.0:\r\n```\r\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080//authorization.site/\r\n* Host localhost:8080 was resolved.\r\n* IPv6: ::1\r\n* IPv4: 127.0.0.1\r\n*   Trying [::1]:8080...\r\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080\r\n> GET //authorization.site/ HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: localhost:8080\r\n> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n> \r\n* Request completely sent off\r\n< HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\r\n< Server: TornadoServer/6.4.1\r\n< Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n< Date: Sun, 20 Oct 2024 17:49:24 GMT\r\n< Content-Length: 69\r\n< Vary: Accept-Encoding\r\n< \r\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\r\n<html><title>403: Forbidden</title><body>403: Forbidden</body></html>%  \r\n```\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nCurl response when requesting against Streamlit version 1.39.0:\r\n```\r\ncurl -v http://localhost:8080//authorization.site/\r\n* Host localhost:8080 was resolved.\r\n* IPv6: ::1\r\n* IPv4: 127.0.0.1\r\n*   Trying [::1]:8080...\r\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080\r\n> GET //authorization.site/ HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: localhost:8080\r\n> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n> \r\n* Request completely sent off\r\n< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\r\n< Server: TornadoServer/6.4.1\r\n< Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n< Date: Sun, 20 Oct 2024 17:30:50 GMT\r\n< Location: //authorization.site\r\n< Content-Length: 0\r\n< Vary: Accept-Encoding\r\n< \r\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\r\n ```\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.39.0\r\n- Python version: 3.9\r\n- Operating System: MacOs \r\n- Browser: Curl\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9690/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
