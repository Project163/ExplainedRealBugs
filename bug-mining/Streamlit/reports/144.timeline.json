Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.\n- [X] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nI would like a config like server.headless in that it suppresses the greeting message and the creation of the ~/.streamlit folder, but unlike server.headless in that it would still try to open the page in the web browser once it's initialized.\n\n### Why?\n\nI am not running streamlit truly headlessly; I am using it for local development. However, I don't want to create a .streamlit folder in my home directory, nor do I wish to answer the interactive prompt each time. So currently I'm using the headless option in my config.toml. It would be nice for me if there were an option that was like headless, but still tried to open the web browser. \n\n### How?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nThis creates a new configuration option, server.prompt, which controls if the \"Welcome to Streamlit!\" prompt is shown (and email is asked for and ~/.streamlit folder is created).\r\n\r\nThis is distinct from server.headless because the server is not run in headless mode (eg: the browser opens automatically).\r\n\r\nNota bene: because no .streamlit folder is created, the telemetry warning displays every time, which I think is fine. I assume it's better to inform the user of this (for the purposes of informed implicit consent) than the slight annoyance it presumably will cause some.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\nCloses #8098 \r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Unit Tests: a python unit test analogous to the one for server.headless\r\n\r\nI'd like to test to ensure ~/.streamlit is not created if prompt is false, but I found it too difficult to figure out the right way to do this.\r\n\r\n## Side note\r\nAs I was doing this on Windows 10, in cmd, I got many pre-commit errors of the form `Failed to open the file: lib/streamlit/elements/arrow.py. Is it binary file?`, which I believe is an encoding error probably stemming from the fact that until https://peps.python.org/pep-0686/ goes through the default encoding on Windows is some random windows garbage, so files with emoji are detected as binary. However, I couldn't see anything obviously wrong with the relevant pre-commit hook (which doesn't even have that error message in its source code?) https://github.com/Lucas-C/pre-commit-hooks/blob/master/pre_commit_hooks/insert_license.py, so I decided not to investigate further. Just mentioning in case this helps someone somehow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11395/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18177366509,"node_id":"CE_lADODCoeTs5-c9RLzwAAAAQ7dJnt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/18177366509","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-16T19:58:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18177366544,"node_id":"REFE_lADODCoeTs5-c9RLzwAAAAQ7dJoQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/18177366544","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dcb5bf5a08de9b687a2b9d5b86b3244b808aeddb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/commits/dcb5bf5a08de9b687a2b9d5b86b3244b808aeddb","created_at":"2025-06-16T19:58:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
