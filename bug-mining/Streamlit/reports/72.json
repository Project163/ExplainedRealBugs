The exact same configuration (i.e. copying the file tree including the python environment) works fine on the us version of Windows. I suspect that it might be somehow related to [this](https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp/issues/302). Simply changing the locale did not allow me to reproduces the issue on the us version of windows though. This is referring to a local deployment.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport os\r\nimport streamlit.components.v1 as st_components\r\n\r\nparent_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\r\n# Contains index.html\r\nbuild_dir = os.path.join(parent_dir, '..', \"js-component\", \"dist\")\r\n_component_func = st_components.declare_component(\"flash_viewer_grid\", path=build_dir)\r\n\r\nout_components = []\r\ndata_for_drawing = {}\r\ncomponent_key = \"flash_viewer_grid\"\r\n\r\ncomponent_value = _component_func(component=out_components, data_for_drawing=data_for_drawing, key=component_key)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nDisplay of the custom component.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe component is not found:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e179f2b-0c63-48d5-ab36-f46250ebfe51)\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.34.0\r\n- Python version: 3.11\r\n- Operating System: Windows 11 (Korean)\r\n- Browser: Microsoft Edge\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9365/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
