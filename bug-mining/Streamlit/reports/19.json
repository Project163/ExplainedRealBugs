Install PDM: `pipx install pdm`\r\n2. Create new directory and go there: `mkdir st_test; cd st_test`\r\n3. Init pdm: `pdm init` (and use the defaults)\r\n4. Install streamlit: `pdm add streamlit`\r\n5. Use any minimal streamlit example and run streamlit: `pdm run streamlit run hello_world.py`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nBrowser opens correct web page served by streamlit.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nBrowser tries to connect to `localhost:3000` (which is also mentioned in the logs), but when I look at the logs, the server actually runs on port 8501. When I try this port, I get a 404, so I _can_ connect to the server on this port, but something's broken.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nThat is, did this use to work the way you expected in the past?\r\nnever tried before\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 0.80.0\r\n- Python version: 3.8.8\r\n- Using pdm\r\n- OS version: Linux 5.11.11\r\n- Browser version: Chrome 89.0.4389.114 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\njupyter-lab show a similar issue with pdm, but it can be fixed by running `pdm run jupyter-lab --core-mode`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AnOctopus","id":7356217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTYyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7356217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus","html_url":"https://github.com/AnOctopus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3132/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
