For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nmin_value, max_value = st.select_slider(\r\n    label = 'Example select_slider widget',\r\n    options = [i for i in range(0,101)],\r\n    value = (0,100),\r\n    format_func = lambda x: 'Less' if x == 0 else 'More' if x == 100 else ''\r\n)\r\n\r\nst.write(min_value)\r\nst.write(max_value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nOur sliders currently don't have standard widget height (40px), which creates problems with layout (e.g. when placing a slider and other widgets side by side). This PR makes the slider standard height and modernizes it a bit by removing the min/max value, adjusting the padding, and changing the font of the thumb to sans serif. \r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n<img width=\"1464\" height=\"278\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-19 at 16 34 43@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc60749a-31c9-4721-9ebb-854a2a99bcb9\" />\r\n<img width=\"1464\" height=\"278\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-19 at 16 35 14@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddd079d0-fe28-42cd-b61c-6cf0f1079825\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n<img width=\"1464\" height=\"278\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-19 at 16 35 41@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00379a19-f526-4291-add1-eece9f47cabf\" />\r\n<img width=\"1464\" height=\"278\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-19 at 16 35 52@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9198d98-87c6-418d-ada0-96b0517aae53\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\nCloses #5936\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\nUpdated snapshots, which should cover all the visual changes here.
