While this doesn't affect app behavior, it's a pretty critical bug because you need to manually restart Streamlit all the time in this configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a project dir like this:\r\n\r\n    .\r\n    |- subdir\r\n       |- streamlit_app.py  # this imports secondary\r\n       |- secondary.py\r\n\r\nAnd then run:\r\n\r\n    streamlit run subdir/streamlit_app.py\r\n\r\nThis will run the app but it won’t show a reload prompt when secondary.py changes. Instead, you need to manually rerun the Streamlit app. See also this [discussion on Slack](https://streamlit.slack.com/archives/C019AE89C2C/p1627346650027100). (Btw if streamlit_app.py is in root and only secondary.py is in subdir, this works).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 0.87\r\n- Python version: 3.8\r\n- Pipenv\r\n- OS version: MacOS\r\n- Browser version: Chrome\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3732/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3732/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
