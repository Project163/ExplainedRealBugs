Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen loading in custom components, they come in with a cloudy white background. I looked at the 1.29.0 change log and I couldn't find anything that would explain why the loading in of the custom components thru HTML changed. Below is a picture of how the custom components look:\r\n<img width=\"1372\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2024-02-14 at 3 42 29 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/82843611/e6199d05-d312-4a2d-8a5a-9ede7232ee42\">\r\n\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nfrom streamlit.components.v1 import html\r\n\r\ntemplate_string = \"\"\"\r\n<head>\r\n    <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com\">\r\n    <link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\" crossorigin>\r\n    <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\"></script>\r\n    <script>\r\n        tailwind.config = {\r\n          theme: {\r\n            extend: {\r\n              fontFamily: {\r\n                sans: ['Inter']\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    </script>\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n    <div class=\"flex flex-col justify-items items-center bg-[#052e16]/50 w-full h-[200px] gap-2 p-6 rounded-lg border-l-[#052e16]/50 border-l-8 shadow-lg\">\r\n        <div class=\"h-2/5\">\r\n            <h2 class=\"sm:text-lg md:text-sm lg:text-lg text-white\">\r\n                Test Metric\r\n            </h2>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"h-3/5\">\r\n            <h2 class=\"font-semibold text-3xl text-white\">\r\n                0.0\r\n            </h2>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nhtml(\r\n   template_string,\r\n   height=200\r\n)\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhat I would expect to happen is that the custom components are loaded in accordingly without the cloudy white background.
