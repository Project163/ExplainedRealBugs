This issue can be demonstrated using a decorator as an example, where the decorator includes a try-except block and wraps a function that calls st.rerun. This behavior does not occur when st.rerun is called directly within a function without such error handling. This issue appeared after the 1.37 release\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\ndef error_logging_decorator(func):\r\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\r\n        try:\r\n            return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            logging.error(f\"Error in function {func.__name__}: {e}\")\r\n            st.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\r\n            raise e  # Re-raise the exception\r\n    return wrapper\r\n@error_logging_decorator\r\ndef decorated_function():\r\n    if st.button(\"Refresh\"):\r\n        st.rerun()\r\n\r\ndef plain_function():\r\n    if st.button(\"Refresh2\"):\r\n        st.rerun()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. run an st.rerun inside a try except block\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBoth the decorated_function and plain_function should trigger a rerun when the \"Refresh\" button is pressed.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\ndecorated_function raises an exception and fails to rerun.\r\nplain_function works as expected and triggers a rerun\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.37\r\n- Python version: 3.10\r\n- Operating System: macOS\r\n- Browser: chrome\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n#Logs:\r\n\r\n2024-07-26 13:10:22,773 - admin - ERROR - Error in function decorated_function: RerunData(page_script_hash='d42b4824a51958adffc95194dcc95934', is_fragment_scoped_rerun=True)\r\nstreamlit.runtime.scriptrunner.exceptions.RerunException: RerunData(page_script_hash='d42b4824a51958adffc95194dcc95934', is_fragment_scoped_rerun=True)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9155/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
