However, this can't be true, because if I `streamlit run` a file *without*\r\n```\r\n[browser]\r\nserverAddress = \"localhost\"\r\n```\r\nin the config.toml\r\n\r\nI get something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.\r\n\r\n  Network URL: http://[some private IPv4 address]:8501\r\n  External URL: http://[some public IPv4 address]:8501\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when I *add* the lines to the config.toml I get\r\n\r\n```\r\n  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.\r\n\r\n  URL: http://localhost:8501\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead. (Which is the desired behavior in my case.)\r\n\r\nlocalhost:8501 works to access the application either way.\r\n\r\nThis is either a documentation issue or a true bug.","closed_by":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8629/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8629/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
