You can try out the demo app and download the wheel file here: https://flex-layout-demo.streamlit.app/\n\nWe'd love your feedback! If you have any feedback (no matter if good or bad, bug or feature request), please post below. I'd also love to see what you're building :)\n\n### Why?\n\nStreamlit only has very limited layout options. By shipping a flexbox-like container, we hope to offer a basic building block that lets you build much more complex layouts. \n\n### How?\n\nSee details in the demo app! Here are a few examples of what you can build:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9059db98-9076-4a0d-88ec-ee0547f827ea)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ddf1dc6-3658-41bb-9067-3dce8b75e9fd)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f935c20d-34d7-46ca-8177-5c4a81d0d055)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41bd21b5-e568-4ced-908e-b527685a267c)\n\n### Additional Context\n\nRelated issues:\n\n- #1799 \n- #6132\n- #8197\n- #4388\n- #2515\n- #8135 \n- #5466\n- #6592","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10895/reactions","total_count":84,"+1":72,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":10,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10895/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
