Create a Streamlit app with the provided code snippet.\n2. Run the app and observe that `st.context.timezone` returns the correct timezone string (e.g., Europe/Madrid).\n3. Make any change to the `.py` file, such as adding a blank line, and save the file.\n4. Observe the automatic page refresh and check the value returned by `st.context.timezone`.\n5. Click the button or refresh the page to recover the initial correct timezone.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAfter making changes to the `.py` files and saving them, the page should refresh automatically, and `st.context.timezone` should consistently return the correct timezone string of the user's browser.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nAfter saving changes to the `.py` files, the page refreshes automatically, causing `st.context.timezone` to return `\"\"`. \nThe correct timezone is restored by the page.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.45.0\n- Python version: 3.10.11\n- Operating System: Windows 11\n- Browser: Chrome and Edge\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11330/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
