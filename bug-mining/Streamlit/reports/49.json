Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe title of my page starts on the bottom of page 1 in the printed view, this seems to be the case when the app has more than one page in it\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nmain.py:\r\n\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nst.write(\"Test Title\")\r\n\r\npages/1_TestPage.py:\r\n\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nst.write(\"Test Title 2\")\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create the project as specified\r\n2. Save to GitHub\r\n3. Run on streamlit.io\r\n4. Go to ... and choose Print\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe page comes up in a printable screen and looks as it goes on the web\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe title doesn't start until the bottom of the first page or start of the second page (this seems to vary a bit), so we have almost an entirely blank page at the top\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: Both 1.29.0 (my original project that had the issue) and whatever streamlit.io is defaulting to today (for the test)\r\n- Python version: Both 3.12.0 (my original project that had the issue) and whatever streamlit.io is defaulting to today (for the test)\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10 Home\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n[https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5020](url)","closed_by":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7815/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
