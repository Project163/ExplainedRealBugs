That's obviously expected to some extent, but maybe there's something we can speed up?\n\n### Why?\n\nThis can be a problem when rendering lots of long markdown texts, e.g., in a chat UI with lots of messages. This is especially annoying since `st.write` (which is often used for convenience) uses `st.markdown` under the hood for any kind of text. \n\n### How?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\nSmall script to reproduce:\n\n```python\nimport streamlit as st\nelement = st.radio(\"Element to use\", [\"st.markdown\", \"st.text\"])\ntext = \"ABCabc\" * 10000\nif st.button(\"Run element\"):\n    if element == \"st.text\":\n        st.text(text)\n    else:\n        st.markdown(text)\n    st.write(\"DONE\")\n```","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11550/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
