When assigning items via key/dict notation (`st.secrets[\"foo\"] = \"bar\"`), it properly shows an exception:\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2025-01-03 at 19 40 45](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/628ad049-03a3-41b3-aa7c-fe3b3d6112b5)\r\n\r\nBut when assigning an item via dot notation (`st.secrets.foo = \"bar\"`), it simply fails silently, i.e. it doesn't show an exception but it also doesn't set the item. I think in this situation it should also show an exception. \r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n[![Open in Streamlit Cloud](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/?issue=gh-10107)\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nst.secrets.foo = \"bar\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nShow same exception message as for `st.secrets[\"foo\"] = \"bar\"`. \r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nNothing. \r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.41.0\r\n- Python version:\r\n- Operating System:\r\n- Browser:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10107/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
