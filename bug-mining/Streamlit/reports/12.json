See this [comment](https://blog.streamlit.io/0-89-0-release-notes/) on our blog post, and are asking for ways to configure it. \r\n\r\nThere is a product/design discussion to be had:\r\n\r\n1. Do we add a header color?\r\n2. If no, should we update our docs to clarify that the header color is not configurable anymore?\r\n\r\ncc: @tvst ","closed_by":{"login":"asaini","id":1134064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQwNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini","html_url":"https://github.com/asaini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asaini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
