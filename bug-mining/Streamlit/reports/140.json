Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `weight` property in `theme.fontFaces` passes to the [`font-weight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-weight) CSS `@font-face` descriptor. This is parsed correctly if the weight is an integer or an int-like string. However, if a range of weights is passed (like `\"400 600\"`) the font is not correctly interpreted and it doesn't load to the front end.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.sidebar.header(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg`\")\nst.sidebar.subheader(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg`\")\nst.sidebar.write(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg`\")\nst.sidebar.code(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg` #And a code comment\")\nst.header(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg`\")\nst.subheader(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg`\")\nst.write(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg`\")\nst.code(\"fg **fg** _fg_ ***fg*** `fg` #And a code comment\")\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nGet Noto font files form Google:\nhttps://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans\nhttps://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono\n\nConsider the following configuration (with the appropriate font files saved in the static hosting directory.\n\n```\n[server]\nenableStaticServing = true\n[[theme.fontFaces]]\nfamily=\"noto-sans\"\nurl=\"app/static/NotoSans-Italic-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf\"\nstyle=\"italic\"\n[[theme.fontFaces]]\nfamily=\"noto-sans\"\nurl=\"app/static/NotoSans-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf\"\nstyle=\"normal\"\nweight=800\n[[theme.fontFaces]]\nfamily=\"noto-mono\"\nurl=\"app/static/NotoSansMono-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf\"\nstyle=\"normal\"\n[theme]\nfont=\"noto-sans\"\ncodeFont=\"noto-mono\"\n```\n\nThe makes the non-italic font all have weight 800.\n\nIf the weight line is changed to:\n```\nweight=\"400\"\n```\n...then all non-italic font has normal weight.\n\nHowever, if the weight line is changed to:\n```\nweight=\"400 800\"\n```\n...the non-italic font doesn't load and everything uses the italic font instead (as the closest available font).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: v1.44.2.dev20250421\n- Python version: 3.11\n- Operating System:\n- Browser:\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11163/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
