That means long strings without a whitespace won't wrap. \n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n[![Open in Streamlit Cloud](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/?issue=gh-10824)\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nlong_string = \"askldfjlweklrjweifjlsdfliwjlierjilsildfjlslfijwilerijlesijlrlijsdflijslijerilweilrilsdfilsilfijlsdf\"\n\nst.code(long_string, wrap_lines=True)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRun this app, or see [playground](https://streamlit.io/playground?example=blank&code=H4sIAAAAAAAAA02NQQ7DMAgE736FlVMrVf1BftF7ZDUkWrJxInDl75fm1AOwjHYB-3lYy95Myk60XDyWlHjUdQqKuuYxD8U3zouyy0bTLgjt80J0JcQUdFwG5wLtoBiU4tGM0MuqHhU8joAxAl6xCPz0kJK35_uY5fb3_JG7lXMiqvj4so_cv_NhDCGyAAAA).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWraps. \n\n### Current Behavior\n\nDoesn't wrap. \n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.43\n- Python version:\n- Operating System:\n- Browser:\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10824/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
