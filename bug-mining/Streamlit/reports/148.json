You go to some other tab in browser(I am using Safari), you come back and you see either the same time continue OR the time restarts from 0. This doesnt allow you to properly see how much time has passed.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport time\n\nimport streamlit as st\n\nt = 100\nwith st.spinner(\"Notice the different in spinner time vs time printed\", show_time= True):\n    for i in range(t):\n        time.sleep(1)\n        st.write(i)\n    \nst.success(\"Done\")\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1) Run the above code\n2) After 5 seconds, go away to some other tab and waiting 10-15 seconds\n3) Come back, you will see spinner count around 6 seconds. Although the printed time would be much more.\nThis may also start to 0 seconds, after waiting more than 1 minute(purely observation). For the restart case, if you just go to different tab for few seconds, it may not happen. Go for a coffee and come back. like go to different tab, for a minute-ish atleast.(again purely observational).\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTime printed and time shown in spinner should be same. Also the restart of time (for more than a minute) should not be there.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nNA\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.46.0\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Operating System: MacOS\n- Browser: Safari\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11720/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
