Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nAfter https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/11307 got merged and released with 1.46.0, all select boxes are now case sensitive, but it is not possible to set `ignore_case` in the `st.selectbox()` method (or I couldn't figure out how).\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nprint(st.version.STREAMLIT_VERSION_STRING)\n\nst.selectbox(\n    label=\"Fruit\",\n    options=[\n        \"Apple\",\n        \"Red apple\",\n        \"Green apple\",\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI should be able to control whether the case is ignored or not.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nOptions are case sensitive:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f59fc2c-e578-456c-bf80-0a1f7d92104e)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddef9327-b6d4-4ee6-953c-2affc8620169)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.46.0\n- Python version: 3.13.3\n- Operating System: Fedora 42\n- Browser: Firefox 139.0.4\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
