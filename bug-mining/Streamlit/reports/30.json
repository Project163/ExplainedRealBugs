Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen switching pages via a button and `switch_page`, instead of the following page being loaded as expected, the screen freezes until the code of the page finishes executing. This does not occur if I use the sidebar to load the other page.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n# in main.py\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\n\r\nif st.button(\"Go to page1\"):\r\n    st.switch_page(\"pages/page1.py\")\r\n\r\n\r\n# in pages/page1.py\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress_text = \"Operation in progress. Please wait.\"\r\nmy_bar = st.progress(0, text=progress_text)\r\n\r\nfor percent_complete in range(100):\r\n    time.sleep(0.1)\r\n    my_bar.progress(percent_complete + 1, text=progress_text)\r\ntime.sleep(1)\r\nst.text(\"Operation done\")\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create empty project with `main.py` and `pages/page1.py` as specified in the reproducible code example.\r\n2. Run `streamlit run main.py`.\r\n3. Click `\"Go to page1\"` button.\r\n4. Like 95% of the times, the page freezes as shown in the image below, instead of showing progress bar.\r\n    ![image](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/36459138/28e6fa32-4519-40c7-beea-ff66f0bc8999)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf I go to `pages/page1` directly (instead of using the button that calls the `switch_page`) by typing the page address directly or using the sidebar, the progress bar is shown as expected (see image below).\r\n![image](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/36459138/cb6c6000-dc0e-47bf-9d2a-2dc2b189a906)\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nLike 95% of the times, the page freezes as shown in the image below, instead of showing progress bar.\r\n![image](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/36459138/28e6fa32-4519-40c7-beea-ff66f0bc8999)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.30.0\r\n- Python version: 3.10.12\r\n- Operating System: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS x86_64\r\n- Browser: Mozilla Firefox 121.0.1\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-jcarroll","id":116604821,"node_id":"U_kgDOBvM_lQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116604821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-jcarroll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-jcarroll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7954/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
