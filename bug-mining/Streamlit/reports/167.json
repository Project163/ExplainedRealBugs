This causes issues further down the road, if the data is addressed using the indices and the user changed them.  \r\nAdditionally, I found no way to disable the editing of the index column as is possible using [st.column_config](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/data/st.column_config) for every other column.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nst.write('Table 1 (no index)')\r\ndf_no_index = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    data={'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [11, 12, 13]}\r\n)\r\nst.data_editor(df_no_index)\r\n\r\nst.write('Table 2 (number index)')\r\ndf_number_index = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    data={'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [11, 12, 13]},\r\n    index=[0, 1, 2],\r\n)\r\nst.data_editor(df_number_index)\r\n\r\nst.write('Table 3 (string index)')\r\ndf_string_index = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    data={'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [11, 12, 13]},\r\n    index=['a', 'b', 'c'],\r\n)\r\nst.data_editor(df_string_index)\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Open the Reproducible Code Example\r\n2. See, that the index is editable in table 2 / 3\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. I expect the `st.data_editor` to behave consistently whether an index is given or not (compare Table 1 and 2).\r\n2. I would have expected to find a way to disable the index column, preventing editing by the user.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThere is no way of disabling the editing of dataframe index.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.38.0\r\n- Python version: 3.11.9\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10 Enterprise, Version 22H2\r\n- Browser: Microsoft Edge, Version 129.0.2792.65\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI wasn't sure if this qualifies as a bug report or is simply a feature request. Anyways, it was easier to write it down using this form.","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-dmatthews","id":135349133,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBFDjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135349133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-dmatthews","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dmatthews/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9570/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9570/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
