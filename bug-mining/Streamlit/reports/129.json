If you trigger a rerender, either once or twice, than the full chart shows up.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport altair as alt\r\n\r\n\r\nst.title(\"Altair Chart cut-off bug\")\r\n\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    {\"x\": [1, 2, 3, 4], \"y\": [1, 2, 3, 4], \"category\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"]}\r\n)\r\n\r\nchart = (\r\n    alt.Chart(df)\r\n    .mark_line(point=True)\r\n    .encode(\r\n        x=alt.X(\"x\", title=\"Date\"),\r\n        y=alt.Y(\"y:Q\", title=\"Legend Value\"),\r\n        color=alt.Color(\"category:N\", title=\"Category\").legend(\r\n            orient=\"bottom\", title=None\r\n        ),\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\nst.write(\"use_container_width=True\")\r\nst.altair_chart(chart, use_container_width=True)\r\n\r\n# THE REST OF THIS JUST SHOWS MORE EXAMPLES\r\n\r\nst.write(\"use_container_width=False\")\r\nst.altair_chart(chart, use_container_width=False)\r\n\r\nst.write(\"No bottom legend\")\r\n# This one renders properly initially\r\nchart = (\r\n    alt.Chart(df)\r\n    .mark_line(point=True)\r\n    .encode(\r\n        x=alt.X(\"x\", title=\"Date\"),\r\n        y=alt.Y(\"y:Q\", title=\"Legend Value\"),\r\n        color=alt.Color(\"category:N\", title=\"Category\"),\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\nst.altair_chart(chart, use_container_width=True)\r\n\r\n\r\nst.button(\"Rerender\")\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n* Load the app, and see that the y axis is cut off\r\n* Hit the rerender button twice to see it fully show the chart\r\n\r\n![2024-08-26_16-53-49_(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da96fbb4-c9d2-4b2f-9f63-7b20888d92b8)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe chart should show fully on the initial load\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.37.1\r\n- Python version: 3.10.3\r\n- Operating System: OSX\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nTested also on 1.35 on Streamlit-in-Snowflake, same behavior","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9339/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9339/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
