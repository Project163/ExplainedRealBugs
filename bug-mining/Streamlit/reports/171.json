I think we should get rid of them. \n\n\n### Why?\n\nToday, you can pass arbitrary `**kwargs` to `st.plotly_chart`, which, according to our documentation, gets passed through to Plotly's `plot()` function. However:\n\n- That's not the case. We only extract a `config` parameter from `**kwargs` (see [here](https://plotly.com/python/configuration-options/)) and pass that through. Additionally, we extract `show_link` and `link_text` and put that into `config` if available, but according to our telemetry data, these parameters are basically never used. \n- The `plot()` function from Plotly mentioned in our docs is outdated. The modern alternative is `show()`. \n- Accepting arbitrary `kwargs` is messy. E.g. right now we're trying to add `width` and `height` to `st.plotly_chart` but some users are already setting these parameters through `kwargs`, probably because they think they get passed through to Plotly. While it doesn't cause any problem in this case, it's better to avoid such problems in the future. \n\n### How?\n\nI'd suggest we:\n\n- Mark `**kwargs` as deprecated and potentially remove it soon. I.e. this should raise a deprecation warning whenever you pass a parameter not explicitly supported. \n- Add `config` as an explicit parameter and say that this is the Plotly config dict, which is getting passed to the `show()` function. \n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12280/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
