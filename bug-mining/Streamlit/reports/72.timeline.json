A registry entry set the mime-type of javascript files to `text/plain` causing the browser to refuse execution. I did some research and came up with a solution. I will open a PR soon that avoids this issue (which apparently is not uncommon for windows systems).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2325793615/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"t0mdavid-m","id":57191390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTkxMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57191390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m","html_url":"https://github.com/t0mdavid-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"t0mdavid-m","id":57191390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTkxMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57191390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m","html_url":"https://github.com/t0mdavid-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t0mdavid-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-03T09:26:46Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T09:26:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9390/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9390/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9390/events","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9390","id":2502371031,"node_id":"PR_kwDODCoeTs56PKr3","number":9390,"title":"Determine

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nThe mime-type of a file is important for the browser to determine how to render content. For custom components in Streamlit, the mime-type is determined by `mimetypes.guess_type()`, which (skipping over some details) determines the mime type by file extension and a predefined mapping of `file-extension->mime-type`. Furthermore, the configuration of the operating system (for windows that is the registry) is taken into account and given precedent over the predefined mapping in Python.\r\n\r\nThe registry can in principle be changed by any program and [some programs](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32350) seem to change the mime-type of javascript files to `text/plain` during installation. This causes an issue for custom components as web browsers refuse to execute javascript files with the mime-type `text/plain` causing custom components not to be rendered. This was the root cause of #9365.\r\n\r\nThis issue was also discussed by the [Python community](https://bugs.python.org/issue32462). They opted not to fix it as the mime type returned is correct for the given system configuration. Any side effects would be system misconfiguration from their point of view.\r\n\r\nFor Streamlit, the argument whether it is system misconfiguration or not is not really applicable. The consequence is that custom components are not rendered and thus this is clearly unintended behavior. The changes in this PR determine the mime-type for the three most common web-related file formats (`html`, `js`, and `css`) by file extension alone using a lookup table. For all other formats the mime-type is determined using the previous implementation.\r\n\r\nNotable repos with similar approaches:\r\n- the [tensorboard project](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/b9ab24224405d0d7cbbeed4ee2da842f645c364d/tensorboard/program.py#L378-L397) solves the same issue in the same way\r\n- the [azure-cli project](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/6322e5868aa50dbc9a71c45b1dc82bdd2e58f9c2/src/azure-cli/azure/cli/command_modules/storage/util.py#L305) also hard-codes the javascript mimetype\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\nFixes #9365 \r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\nIt is hard to come up with a simplistic test case for the cause of the issue as this would require changing the system configuration of the test image.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this
