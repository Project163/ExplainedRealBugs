Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\r\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nWhen I run the code example given, and click the Download buttons in rapid succession, I almost always get a missed download and a *MediaFileHandler: Missing file* message logged.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nst.title(\"Fragment Download\")\r\n\r\n@st.experimental_fragment()\r\ndef dl_button(file: int):\r\n    filename = f\"{file}.pdf\"\r\n    with open(filename, \"rb\") as f:\r\n        st.download_button(\r\n            label=f\"Download {filename}\",\r\n            data=f,\r\n            file_name=filename,\r\n        )\r\n\r\nfor ix in range(10):\r\n    dl_button(ix)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Populate the folder containing the given Streamlit *app.py* with 10 unique PDF files, named *0.pdf* through *9.pdf*.\r\n2. `streamlit run app.py`\r\n3. Click the first button, then the 2nd button, then the 3rd, etc., without pausing, but you don't necessarily need to do it very fast.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect every download to succeed. Removing `@st.experimental_fragment` fixes to where they do succeed, but in our application, the `@st.experimental_fragment` is otherwise useful for app performance.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nMore often than not, at least one of the Download buttons will fail to download (Chrome & Edge show \"Couldn't Download xxx in UI\", while Firefox just opens a blank tab). A message similar to the following is logged:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-06-18 14:39:34.602 MediaFileHandler: Missing file 0ab6ea69b3c422b32dd59acb39a7e2818512c1682364c987b183bac7.bin\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.35.0\r\n- Python version: 3.10.14\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS\r\n- Browser: Firefox, Chrome, Edge (differences noted above)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8932/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
