Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWith the new feature of specific cache clear in 1.34, I'm unable to clear specific cache for class instance function (self).\r\nThe \"self\" argument is named \"_self\" so it won't be calculated for hash\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport random\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nclass Test:\r\n    @st.cache_data\r\n    def print_random(_self, var):\r\n        st.text(random.randint(0, 10000))\r\n\r\ntest = Test()\r\nst.title('Hello World')\r\nif st.button('Print Random Number'):\r\n    test.print_random(1)\r\nif st.button('Clear cache'):\r\n    test.print_random.clear(1)\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. click on 'Print Random Number'\r\n2. click on 'Clear cache'\r\n3. click on 'Print Random Number'\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDifferent number printed\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nSame number printed, i.e. the function is not executed, i.e. the cache is not cleared\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.34.0\r\n- Python version: 3.10\r\n- Operating System: macOS\r\n- Browser: chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis works perfectly without arguments, clearing the entire cache for the function","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8638/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
