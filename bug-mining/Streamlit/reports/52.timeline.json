BEFORE CONTRIBUTING PLEASE READ OUR CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES!\r\nhttps://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/wiki/Contributing\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Describe your changes\r\n- fixes #8360 by removing the widget id for the react key\r\n- this also seems to fix resetting plotly widgets for selections\r\n  - This would could fix some Altair and Plotly widgets bugs because Altair and Plotly components remain but it will rerender and toss a duplicate widgetId console error and not rerender properly\r\n- the delta message to the frontend will add an element with the same widget ID as another element in the same BlockNode, causing a React \"Encountered two children with the same key\" error in the frontend\r\n- Using index is an antipattern and shouldn't be used if new elements are inserted at the top so it seems like that's why we originally used the widget id\r\n  - source: https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Explanation of why no additional tests are needed\r\n- Unit Tests (JS and/or Python)\r\n- E2E Tests\r\n- Any manual testing needed?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License

here:\r\n1. Right now, we trigger a stale-node clearing also for fragment runs that were interrupted by a rerun message. This leads to a situation where elements can disappear for a moment (see [this user comment with video](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9372#issuecomment-2324932864)).\r\nThis PR moves the clearing into the if-block that is only executed for finished complete runs.\r\n2. We capture all element ids we rendered and if we encounter the same id twice, we ignore it (prevents regressing on #8360) \r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nFor the example app:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Example App</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nif 'count' not in st.session_state:\r\n  st.session_state.count = 0\r\n\r\nif 'foo' not in st.session_state:\r\n    st.write(f'Setting state ({st.session_state.count})')\r\n    st.session_state['foo'] = 'bar'\r\n\r\nif st.button('Run'):\r\n    # Allow for forward message queue to flush button element\r\n    time.sleep(1)\r\n\r\n    st.session_state.count += 1\r\n    del st.session_state['foo']\r\n    st.rerun()\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nthe flow is as following (ever step triggers a new session message with a new `scriptRunId`):\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n  <th>Step</th>\r\n  <th>Phase / Action</th>\r\n  <th>Messages the Frontend receives</th>\r\n  <th>Comment</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td>1</td>\r\n  <td>First App Run</td>\r\n  <td>[Markdown, Button]</td>\r\n  <td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td>2</td>\r\n  <td>Rerun by Button Click</td>\r\n  <td>[Button]</td>\r\n  <td>The button click itself triggers an app rerun. <code>foo</code> is in the session state (not deleted yet), so the <code>if</code> block is <i>not</i> executed.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td>3</td>\r\n  <td>Rerun by <code>st.rerun</code> in the button's if-block</td>\r\n  <td>[Markdown, Button]</td>\r\n  <td>The <code>st.rerun</code> line executes a rerun. <code>foo</code> is deleted from the session state, so the <code>if</code> block is executed again. <b>No stale-nodes cleaning happened</b> because its an early interrupt by a rerun.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td>4</td>\r\n  <td>App Run is Complete</td>\r\n  <td>Session Finished</td>\r\n  <td>The stale-nodes are cleaned because this is a full app finished run.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nWith fix 1 (move cleaning of stale nodes to finished successfully runs), what happens is that the `Button` element of step 3 is sent to the frontend, but the `Button` element of step 2 is still in the `elements` list, because it was not cleaned up (after the fix 1 change). Both elements have the same React key, which throws an error and leads to the stale React element being shown.\r\nWith fix 2, this is addressed because the `Button` element is sent to the frontend, now the list of elements still contain two `Button` elements with the same id (remember no cleaning happened). But now, only one element with the same ket is rendered and the second is ignored. Our `applyDelta`'s `setIn` logic leads to the fact that the _new_ `Button` element appears in the `elements` list _before_ the old one, which means that the newer element is rendered and the older one is ignored.\r\nIn step 4, the script finishes successfully completely (a full top to bottom run), and. thus. a `cleanStaleNodes` execution is triggered which establishes the final, cleaned state. Now, the frontend again has just two elements in its list: `[Markdown, Button]`.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn this comment I have linked a video and an example app: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9389#issuecomment-234295933\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Explanation of why no additional tests are needed\r\n- Unit Tests (JS and/or Python)\r\n  - Add JS unit tests for cleaning node behavior (also enhance our typing)\r\n- E2E Tests\r\n  - Add e2e test to test app that would have been regressed with first version of the PR\r\n- Any manual testing needed?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this
