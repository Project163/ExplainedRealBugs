Maybe adding a feature to recognise any type of url? starts with www.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nst.dataframe(df,\r\n                         column_config={\r\n                             \"Link\": st.column_config.LinkColumn(\"Link\")\r\n                            }\r\n                         )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFor any link to work. Just click and the page opens.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nhttps://username-appname-appname-xxxxxx.streamlit.app/~/+/www.xx-xxxxxx.de/xxxxxx.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: \r\n- Python version:\r\n- Operating System:\r\n- Browser:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are most important to our users.\r\n\r\n**If you'd like the Streamlit team to prioritize this feature request, please use the 👍 (thumbs up emoji) reaction in response to the initial post.**","closed_by":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7064/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
