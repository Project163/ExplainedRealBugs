Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen changing multiple selectboxes and calling a rerun(), all selectboxes placed after the rerun call change their return values to the first given option (index=0) despite having a different number in the index parameter, and their value reappear correctly after another click somewhere.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif 'options' not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state['options'] = {\n        'option1': 'foo',\n        'option2': 'abc',\n        'option3': 123\n    }\n\noptions_1 = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"bazz\"]\noptions_2 = [\"abc\", \"def\", \"ghi\"]\noptions_3 = [123, 456, 789]\n\noption1 = st.selectbox('Option 1', options=options_1, index=options_1.index(st.session_state['options']['option1']))\nst.write(option1)\nif option1 != st.session_state['options']['option1'] and st.button('Save option1'):\n    st.session_state['options']['option1'] = option1\n    st.rerun()\n\noption2 = st.selectbox('Option 2', options=options_2, index=options_2.index(st.session_state['options']['option2']))\nst.write(option2)\nif option2 != st.session_state['options']['option2'] and st.button('Save option2'):\n    st.session_state['options']['option2'] = option2\n    st.rerun()\n\noption3 = st.selectbox('Option 3', options=options_3, index=options_3.index(st.session_state['options']['option3']))\nst.write(option3)\nif option3 != st.session_state['options']['option3'] and st.button('Save option3'):\n    st.session_state['options']['option3'] = option3\n    st.rerun()\n\nst.divider()\n\nst.write('Session State:')\nst.write(st.session_state)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Change values of all 3 checkboxes\n2. Observe the 3 buttons \"Save optionX\" appear \n4. Click on the second button \"Save option2\" (write option 2 to state)\n5. Observe button for option3 disappear\n6. Observe printed value below selectbox option3 displaying something else that its content\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. Change values of all 3 checkboxes\n2. Observe the 3 buttons \"Save optionX\" appear \n4. Click on the second button \"Save option2\" (write option 2 to state)\n5. \"Save option3\" should remain visible\n6. Printed value for selectbox option3 should remain unchanged on click on \"Save option2\"\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe returned value for selectbox is wrong after rerun() is called.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.44.1\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Operating System: MacOS\n- Browser: Chrome\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nMight be related to #11202

@HHest Thank you for the issue! I am able to reproduce it, and I believe I have a fix. Will likely get merged early next week.\n\nI certainly would appreciate if you tried out the wheel file and confirm it works as you expected. This change touches some critical infrastructure, so I'd like to make sure it doesn't break in unexpected ways. [The wheel file is here](https://core-previews.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pr-11258/streamlit-1.45.0-py3-none-any.whl).\n\nIn the meantime, there are two workarounds I can think of:\n\n1. (recommended) Migrate to our [V2 of Multipage Apps](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/page-and-navigation). Basically it would be defining a different main file to utilize `st.navigation` and move the pages away from `pages` folder. We plan to eventually deprecate the V1 functionality, so this is future-proof.\n2. Certainly can stay on 1.43 for the time being. Assuming this change is fixed, I'd expect this to be in 1.46 or a patch release.\n3. Once this PR is merged, the next day, you can utilize `streamlit-nightly` package which should contain the change.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2847729311/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17502774027,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs60G5DbzwAAAAQTPyML","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/17502774027","actor":{"login":"HHest","id":3169669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjk2Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3169669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest","html_url":"https://github.com/HHest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-02T17:22:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17502774039,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs60G5DbzwAAAAQTPyMX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/17502774039","actor":{"login":"HHest","id":3169669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjk2Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3169669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest","html_url":"https://github.com/HHest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-02T17:22:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2850749333","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11202#issuecomment-2850749333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11202","id":2850749333,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs6p6vuV","user":{"login":"HHest","id":3169669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjk2Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3169669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest","html_url":"https://github.com/HHest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HHest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-05T11:51:43Z","updated_at":"2025-05-05T11:51:43Z","body":"Thank you very much, @kmcgrady.
