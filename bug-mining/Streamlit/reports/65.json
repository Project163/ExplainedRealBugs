Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nst.fragment and st.dialog were de-experimentalized on 1.37, which means existing apps that used the experimental versions would start showing the deprecation warning. If the deprecation warning shows before set_page_config is called (such as during an import), it causes an error.\r\n\r\nSo, packages that use experimental_fragment cause apps to break in 1.37\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\n@st.experimental_fragment\r\ndef fragment():\r\n    st.slider(\"Test\")\r\n\r\nst.set_page_config(layout=\"wide\")\r\n\r\nst.title(\"Simple repro\")\r\nfragment()\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nOpen the app in 1.37\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe app runs as expected\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nError message:\r\n`StreamlitAPIException: set_page_config() can only be called once per app page, and must be called as the first Streamlit command in your script.`\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [X] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.37\r\n- Python version: 3.12.4\r\n- Operating System: MacOS\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI ran into this issue while using the TruLens package. it works on 1.36 but I see this error on 1.37. The fix is to move the imports below set_page_config, but that breaks python convention.","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9143/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
