I hope that the spinner could show the elapsed time, or add a **stopwatch** widget. It would be useful to know how long it takes.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nAdd `show_elapsed` parameter to `st.spinner` to support this feature (default is `False`).\r\n\r\nFrom this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nwith st.spinner('Wait for it...'):\r\n    time.sleep(5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nwith st.spinner('Wait for it...', show_elapsed=True):\r\n    time.sleep(5)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are most important to our users.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the Streamlit team to prioritize this feature request, please use the 👍 (thumbs up emoji) reaction in response to the initial post.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jrieke","id":5103165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDMxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6805/reactions","total_count":56,"+1":55,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
