It does not clear the `st.experimetal_singleton` or `st.experimental_memo` methods.\r\n\r\nIs this by design? If so, how should cache be cleared for the latter two.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nHere's an example app. Clearing the cache and rerunning doesn't change the time for `st.experimental_singleton` and `st.experimental_memo`\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport time\r\n\r\n\r\n@st.experimental_singleton()\r\ndef get_singleton_time():\r\n    return time.asctime()\r\n\r\n\r\n@st.experimental_memo()\r\ndef get_memo_time():\r\n    return time.asctime()\r\n\r\n\r\n@st.cache()\r\ndef get_cache_time():\r\n    return time.asctime()\r\n\r\n\r\nst.write(f\"cache time: {get_cache_time()}\")\r\nst.write(f\"experimental_singleton time: {get_singleton_time()}\")\r\nst.write(f\"experimental_memo time: {get_memo_time()}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf applicable, please provide the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:\r\n\r\n1. Start the app\r\n2. Note down the times displayed\r\n3. Clear cache and rerun the app from the hamburger menu (Press `C` and `R`)\r\n4. Note down the times\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nClearing cache from the hamburger menu should clear data from all the caching methods, `st.cache`, `st.experimental_memo` and `st.experimental_singleton`\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nClearing cache from the hamburger menu only clears data from `st.cache`\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.0.0\r\n- Python version: 3.7.10\r\n- Using Conda\r\n- OS version: Mac OS v10.14.5 (18F203)\r\n- Browser version: Chrome Version 92.0.4515.159 (Official Build) (x86_64)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tconkling","id":709022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTAyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling","html_url":"https://github.com/tconkling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
