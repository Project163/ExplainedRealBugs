I'll add a tiny snippet to the docs to give an example of usage. \r\n\r\nHere's a bit of text from our [theming release blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-theming/) describing how to use CSS variables.\r\n\"If you're not familiar with CSS variables, the TLDR version is that you can use them like this:\r\n```css\r\n.mySelector {\r\n  color: var(--text-color);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\"\r\n\r\nThe bit that I add to the custom components documentation will probably be the exact text copied above.
