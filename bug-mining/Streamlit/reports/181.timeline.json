@sfc-gh-kmcgrady one thing to keep in mind is that `st.text_area` has some non-standard behaviour that was already in place before extending the height functionality and it makes it work differently than other elements.  \n\nThe minimum height for the element is measured according to the lines of text in the input so we don't allow heights that will give less than 2 lines of text in the input, so I think that explains a lot of what you are seeing here. The first one should also be 2 lines as well, however, so the boundary for this bug seems to be 29. \n\nI think 150 should be more than 2 lines of text, so I'm surprised by that. I will take a look at that as well!\n\nI think given the way the height has to be applied to this element, the bug is probably just some edge case issue with the calculations and not complex or anything. I just wanted to make sure these bugs are documented here so I can more easily keep track of them.

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in `st.text_area` where very small height values would render larger than expected due to negative height calculations producing invalid CSS.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause:**\r\nWhen calculating inner height, the formula `pixelHeight - labelAndPadding` could produce negative values (e.g., `height=10` with 30px label padding = -20px). Invalid negative CSS height values were ignored by browsers, causing the minHeight (68px) to take over, which made `height=10` render larger than `height=30`.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nAdded `Math.max(0, innerHeight)` to clamp calculated heights to 0 minimum, ensuring all height values produce valid CSS.\r\n\r\nNote: the minimum height for `st.text_area` is such that two lines of text fit in the input, so heights that would result in less space in the input will render as this minimum. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"778\" height=\"279\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 7 16 59 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8bef0d1-b61a-46d0-8d21-b9e0be0a71a0\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"662\" height=\"614\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 7 17 28 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78e5d03d-b1f3-406f-83dd-da01a5d6a8a9\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"613\" height=\"367\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-29 at 7 17 49 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c4564e-1062-4d93-bb4e-b6664cd87912\" />\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link\r\n\r\nFixes #12867\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- [x] Unit Tests (TypeScript) - 8 parameterized test cases for negative height clamping\r\n  - Tests heights below, at, and above boundary for both visible and collapsed labels\r\n  - Verifies 0px clamping for negative calculations\r\n  - Confirms positive heights work correctly\r\n- [x] E2E Tests - Added snapshot test for `height=10` case\r\n- [x] Manual testing completed with comprehensive test app covering:\r\n  - Original bug demonstration (height=10 vs height=30)\r\n  - Boundary cases from team testing (29, 30, 31)\r\n  - Collapsed label boundary cases (1, 2, 3)\r\n  - Various heights (50, 100, 150, 200)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20609256753,"node_id":"CE_lADODCoeTs7UBX1azwAAAATMaE0x","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/20609256753","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-30T13:28:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20609256819,"node_id":"REFE_lADODCoeTs7UBX1azwAAAATMaE1z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/20609256819","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9d3a016fb76b9c02e96f0a777748ef5fdfb62690","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/commits/9d3a016fb76b9c02e96f0a777748ef5fdfb62690","created_at":"2025-10-30T13:28:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
