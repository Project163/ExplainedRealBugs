for many ML use cases. \n\n### How?\n\nAdd a new command `st.audio_input`. Return format should probably be compatible with `st.audio`. We could also think about integrating audio input with `st.chat_input` at some point. \n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No

@RonaldAJ ! I was able to confirm it. Looks like something in how Firefox is setting up the audio and how we upload it. I made a PR that should address it. I'd like to do some rigorous testing and make sure things work well for all use cases. Would appreciate if you confirmed the issue is resolved on your setup (Would love if other browsers were tested and verified as well.\r\n\r\nThe wheel file is https://core-previews.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pr-9885/streamlit-1.40.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\r\n\r\nOnce downloaded you should uninstall streamlit and install streamlit with `pip install streamlit-1.40.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl`.\r\n\r\nAppreciate help in getting this bug fixed :-)

reproduced the bug locally using firefox with the 1.40.0 release in a dedicated virtual environment:\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- Create a virtual environment:` python3 -m venv sa3_10_st_notfixed`\r\n- Activate the environment: `activate sa3_10_st_notfixed/bin/activate`\r\n- Install streamlit: `pip install streamlit==1.40`\r\n- Save the following code to `streamlit_audio_test.py`:\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nf'{st.__version__=}'\r\n\r\naudio_value = st.audio_input(\"Record a voice message\")\r\n\r\nif audio_value:\r\n    st.audio(audio_value)\r\n```\r\n- run the streamlit script: `streamlit run streamlit_audio_test.py\r\n- Perform the original reproduction steps.\r\n\r\nOutcome:\r\nRecorded one click, st.audio produced two on playback. \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13eb20b6-5880-4aff-8f14-9631710b3eff)\r\n\r\nThen I failed to reproduce the bug locally using firefox with the provided wheel in a second dedicated virtual environment:\r\n\r\nSteps: Essentially the same but with the streamlit install step replaced by:\r\n`pip install streamlit-1.40.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl` using the wheel provided by @kmcgrady. \r\n\r\nOutcome:\r\nRecorded one click, st.audio produced one on playback. \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab7c6c3c-dd2e-44bb-abe2-e67a2abdf951)\r\n\r\n**So it looks like the bug is fixed for Firefox (Version 132.0.2). Also checked Brave and it works with both versions.**\r\n\r\nExtra data on environment: Python 3.10.12, Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2488152790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"RonaldAJ","id":22000954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDAwOTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22000954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ","html_url":"https://github.com/RonaldAJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RonaldAJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15364744815,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs6dbTEYzwAAAAOTz2Zv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/15364744815","actor":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-20T10:10:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15364744834,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs6dbTEYzwAAAAOTz2aC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/15364744834","actor":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-20T10:10:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
