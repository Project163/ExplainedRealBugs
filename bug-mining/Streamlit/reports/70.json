MPAv2 falls back on this algorithm if no `title` is declared. However, some of this modification still occurs within the label in navigation even when `title` is declared.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\na = st.Page(\"a.py\")\r\nb = st.Page(\"3_real__2.py\", title=\"1_page__2\")\r\n\r\nst.navigation([a, b])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create `app.py` as above with addition pages `a.py` and `3_real__2.py`.\r\n2. Run the app.\r\n3. Go to page \"1_page__2\" and look at navigation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"547\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/135349133/3f0f637b-0201-4236-8ae2-129f8c27b641\">\r\nthe \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIf a title is declared, I would expect no character modification. (i.e. Don't remove the underscores.) Unlike with filenames and callables, the title is entirely meant to be displayed to users as is and shouldn't need changing.\r\n\r\nThe underscores are correctly preserved in the HTML title.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe underscores are removed from \"1_page__2\".\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: Streamlit v1.35.1.dev20240609\r\n- Python version: 3.11\r\n- Operating System: Mac\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8890/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
