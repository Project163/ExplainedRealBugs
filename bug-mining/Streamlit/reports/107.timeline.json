Problem\r\n\r\n`st.download_button` has a parameter `data` for the data to be downloaded, but this requires the data to be generated when the button is defined. This is not very efficient if the user doesn't use the download button: the data is generated and held in memory, but it is never used.\r\n\r\nI'm working on an app that generates a DataFrame (based on data uploaded by the user) and I want to offer the option to download this DataFrame as a CSV file. I expect that most of the time users won't download the file, though, they'll just look at the data in the app. In such cases, there's no need to generate the CSV data (and consume memory in the process).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nConceptually the best way, I think, would be to allow the `data` parameter to be a function that generates the data to be written, and to call that function only if the download button is clicked.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nNote that this issue is not the same as issue #4382, (although I guess it is somewhat related).\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround to this issue [in the forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/download-button-data-parameter-issues/34767/20), but IMHO it's not ideal, because it requires the user to click two buttons: one to generate the file to be downloaded, and a second one to actually download it.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are
