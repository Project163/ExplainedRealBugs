#28. Makes it so that you can drag a slider to see the weights of a model update across epochs:\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n* defines a `visualize_state_dict_at_epoch` function in `apps/fourier_transformer_viewer/streamlit_vis.py` that takes a multidimensional state dict (`dict[str, Tensor]`) where all tensors are 3-dimensional (first dim is epoch dim), and returns a plotly figure with a slider. *IMPORTANT: the plotly figure already generates the plots of weights at every epoch, so the slider is just showing/hiding various plots. This all happens within the plotly figure (in javascript), so it is all on the frontent, so it is really fast. Does NOT work at all to make a streamlit slider, then recompute the plotly figure on slider change (lag of 2-3 seconds per slider drag)*\r\n* Create a new, clean dataset of 2 trained functions (temporarily edit the number of functions to 2 in the `bulk_train_cuda` make recipe\r\n* Downgrade streamlit to `v1.41` (from `v1.42`) to get rid of warning messages. See [this core streamlit issue](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10452) for details\r\n* Add deepcopy directive to `get_save_dict()` in `SaveableModule`. This ensures that if you copy state dicts every epoch while training you will actually keep distinct copies rather than a reference to the same set of updating parameters","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/henryscheible/miexp/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/henryscheible/miexp/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2679325386","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10452#issuecomment-2679325386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10452","id":2679325386,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs6fs0LK","user":{"login":"paul-gauthier","id":69695708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Njk1NzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69695708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier","html_url":"https://github.com/paul-gauthier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul-gauthier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-24T18:33:02Z","updated_at":"2025-02-24T18:33:02Z","body":"Thanks for the quick fix.

Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nI have a working Streamlit app. If I modify it to add `import torch`, I get a `RuntimeError` related to asyncio.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\nimport torch\n\npg = st.navigation([\n    st.Page(\"app/home.py\", title=\"Home\"),\n])\n\npg.run()\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nSimply try to run this app with `streamlit run app.py`.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe app should run normally and I should be able to use torch like any other library.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThis is what I get:\n\n```sh\n$ streamlit run app.py \n\n  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.\n\n  Local URL: http://localhost:8501\n  Network URL: http://192.168.1.12:8501\n\n2025-04-01 16:26:00.500 Examining the path of torch.classes raised:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File
