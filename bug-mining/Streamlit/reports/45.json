Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\r\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nUploading a large file with `st.file_uploader` can reliably lead to a:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Value out of range <num-uploaded-bytes>\r\n\r\nFile \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/streamlit/runtime/scriptrunner/script_runner.py\", line 565, in _run_script\r\n    exec(code, module.__dict__)\r\nFile \"/Users/skekre/Downloads/streamlit-misc/file-uploader-size.py\", line 3, in <module>\r\n    f = st.file_uploader(\"Upload a file\")\r\nFile \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/streamlit/runtime/metrics_util.py\", line 311, in wrapped_func\r\n    result = non_optional_func(*args, **kwargs)\r\nFile \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/streamlit/elements/file_uploader.py\", line 338, in file_uploader\r\n    return self._file_uploader(\r\nFile \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/streamlit/elements/file_uploader.py\", line 418, in _file_uploader\r\n    file_uploader_state = serde.serialize(widget_state.value)\r\nFile \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/site-packages/streamlit/elements/file_uploader.py\", line 108, in serialize\r\n    file_info.size = f.size\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere \"large\" in my case was approximately close to or greater than 4.5GB. I'm not sure whether the specific size after which this error is thrown is machine dependant. @serdar-bayramov who first [reported](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/how-to-upload-large-files-using-st-file-uploader/35654) this on the Streamlit forum encountered the error for files >= 2GB.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nf = st.file_uploader(\"Upload a file\")\r\n\r\nif f is not None:\r\n    st.write(f.name)\r\n    st.write(f.size)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a `.streamlit/config.toml` file to set the upload limit to 4.5 GB:\r\n\r\n    ```toml\r\n    [server]\r\n    maxUploadSize = 4500\r\n    ```\r\n2. Create a 4.4 GB file:\r\n    ```sh\r\n    truncate -s 4280m example.file\r\n    ```\r\n3. Run the above app and upload `example.file` to the file uploader widget\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAs the uploaded 4.4 GB file is under the 4.5 GB limit set in `.streamlit/config.toml`, one would expect:\r\n1. to see the upload successfully complete\r\n2. the file uploader widget to be visible after the upload\r\n3. see the output of the filename and filesize displayed\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n1. Once the progress bar on the file uploader widget hits the maximum, the app greys out for a few seconds while the Running man icon is displayed in the top right corner\r\n2. Immediately after that, the file uploader widget disappears, leaving the user with the following error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20672874/211792715-25c255b5-ff1a-4bdc-a24b-6739b85cd42e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.16.0\r\n- Python version: 3.9\r\n- Operating System: macOS\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Virtual environment: NA\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nFirst reported by @serdar-bayramov in https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/how-to-upload-large-files-using-st-file-uploader/35654 \r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, I am willing to submit a PR!","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5938/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":17,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
