Create the entrypoint file and additional pages (`a.py` and `_.py`, can be empty).\r\n2. Run the app and look at navigation\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSince the automatic page title and URL path are insufficient, I'd expect an error.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nSince the file `_.py` has a filename consisting entirely of underscores, there is no number and no \"name\" of the page parsed from the filename by MPAv1 standardards. This means there is no page title and it will not show up in navigation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you add a `title`, it will show up in navigation, but the automatic URL path will be \"\" which won't work (unless this page also happens to be the default page).\r\n\r\nTherefore:\r\n- If the file is named with all underscores and not the default page, both `title` and `url_path` are needed.\r\n- If the file is named with all underscores and is the default page, at least `title` is needed.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: v1.35.1.dev20240609\r\n- Python version: 3.11\r\n- Operating System: Mac\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8892/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8892/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
