Summary\r\n\r\nMaking multiple sliders with the same key, but different labels, results in only one slider value in `session_state` (and does not cause an error). Making multiple sliders with the same key and same label causes an error (this is expected behavior).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nfor k in range(5):\r\n    st.slider(\r\n        f\"Slider {k}\",\r\n        min_value=0,\r\n        max_value=100,\r\n        value=50,\r\n        step=1,\r\n        key=\"slider\",\r\n    )\r\n\r\nst.write(st.session_state)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nAn error should occur.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nNo error occurs.  All five sliders appear, but there is only one slider value in `st.session_state`\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.7.0\r\n- Python version: 3.9.9\r\n- Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex?  No.\r\n- OS version: Mac OS X 12.3\r\n- Browser version: Version 15.4 (17613.1.17.1.6)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4540/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
