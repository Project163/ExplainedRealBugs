@kmcgrady ,\r\n\r\nMy bad, I edited the original issue several times, starting with a while loop then trying with `st.rerun` (essentially the same thing for my app that needs to run every minute)\r\n\r\nI just now corrected the reproduction code, removing `initialize_webapp` and `style_metric_cards` that have no bearing on the matter. \r\n\r\nSo basically the problem boils down to:\r\n- with a vanilla page like page1 at `localhost:8501/page1`, when I edit the page, it stays on page1\r\n- with `page_rerun`, that calls `st.rerun` every second after a `sleep(1)` statement, saving makes the app switch from `localhost:8501/rerun` to `localhost:8501`

@kmcgrady \r\nThanks for looking into it and launching the repro code ! \r\nThe repro was a simplified version and my real layout is using different modules, which doesn't solve the issue. \r\n\r\nHowever, @edsaac 's suggestion did solve the issue 🎉 \r\nThe rendering is not as good, a lot more refreshing is happening on the screen, but at least it works locally 👍 \r\n\r\nI think we can close this for now, thanks !
