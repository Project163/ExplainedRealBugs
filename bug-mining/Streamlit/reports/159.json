Create a `.streamlit/config.toml` with the following contents:\n   ```bash\n   [client]\n   toolbarMode = \"minimal\"\n   ```\n2. Start the \"Reproducible code example\": `streamlit run hello.py`\n3. Observe: No toolbar\n4. Change the toolbarMode to \"viewer\"\n5. Start the \"Reproducible code example\": `streamlit run hello.py`\n6. Observe: Toobar with \"About\" correctly displayed but with the unwanted additional items.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSame behaviour as pre-v1.47; when `toolbarMode = \"minimal\"` show the toolbar but only with options set externally \n\n### Current Behavior\n\nN/A\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.47.1\n- Python version: 3.11.13\n- Operating System: MacOS\n- Browser: Firefox\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12083/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12083/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
