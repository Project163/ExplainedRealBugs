Describe your changes\r\n\r\nAdds markdown support in `st.table` for data cells, row index, and column headers. Note that unlike labels, this doesn't have any restrictions on which markdown features can be used. I think table cells are big enough to handle larger markdown elements (such as headers or bullet lists) without looking ugly.\r\n\r\nI also changed the empty value from `<NA>` to a non-breaking space (i.e. an empty cell) because the smaller/greater symbols caused problems with the markdown formatting. Note that for `st.dataframe` we use `None` for empty values. In `st.table`, I think an empty cell looks nicer though, because `st.table` is less geared towards exploring actual datasets where it might be important to see the actual values and more towards showing a small table of fixed values. \r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-12-27 at 13 23 31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d45b45f-b86c-4d12-a858-0a1b9768609b)\r\n\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\nCloses #8785 \r\n\r\nShould also leave a note on #6461, which asks for markdown on `st.dataframe`. \r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Added an e2e snapshot test for a table with various markdown features.\r\n- I also tried adding JS unit tests but it's not super easy because we need to add the encoded data for a Markdown table in `frontend/lib/src/mocks/arrow/index.ts`. Not sure if it's worth doing that given that the e2e test already covers everything. \r\n- Note that a lot of snapshots changed because of the move from `<NA>` to an empty cell.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0
