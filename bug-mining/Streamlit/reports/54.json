As soon as we switch from Enum to StrEnum then it throws key error.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass ModelStr(str, Enum):\r\n  ZEPHYR = \"hf/zephyr\"\r\n  MISTRAL_7b = \"hf/mistral-7b\"\r\n\r\nclass Model(Enum):\r\n  ZEPHYR = \"hf/zephyr\"\r\n  MISTRAL_7b = \"hf/mistral-7b\"\r\n\r\nllm = st.selectbox(label=\"chose your llm\", options=ModelStr) # this will throw error\r\nllm = st.selectbox(label=\"chose your llm\", options=Model) # this works\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAs soon we go with str enum, key error will be thrown as soon as the code runs.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should work with String enums also\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nError Message ```KeyError: 0```\r\n![image](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/21143936/e5f14d10-32fc-4bba-a37a-5686a6c4829c)\r\n\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.33.0\r\n- Python version: 3.11\r\n- Operating System: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)\r\n- Browser: Safari/Chrome\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI am building on docker, with python:3.11-slim","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8500/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
