a lot for the thorough analysis @ianlcassidy! 🚀 \r\nI am able to reproduce this increased run time duration for the provided app; when commenting out the lines you are pointing to [here](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/lib/streamlit/elements/widgets/number_input.py#L390-L392), the app runs faster for me again. So your analysis seems to be spot on for me. For me, the app run duration is ~300ms with the current code and ~50-110ms without the code lines.\r\nIn order to make this faster again but also prevail the behavior for which the lines were added, I believe we would need to maintain both maps - the current `key->id` and the `id->key` one - at the same time instead of computing the latter on the fly every time; basically trading compute time vs. memory footprint. It looks like the first map (`_key_id_mapping`) is not updated in too many places, so I hope this would be a quick endeavour. If we would go down this route, I guess the best way would be to introduce a wrapper dict class that updates both maps (insert, delete, ...) at the same time to avoid sync-issues.\r\nWhen I print out the size of the map via\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom streamlit.runtime.scriptrunner_utils.script_run_context import (\r\n    get_script_run_ctx,\r\n)\r\n\r\nctx = get_script_run_ctx()\r\nprint(f\"Session state map size: {sys.getsizeof(ctx.session_state.filtered_state)}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nat the end of the script, it says `~9kb`. So we would add around 9kb of additional memory usage (by adding the map in the other direction), which I believe would be a worthy trade if we half the app execution duration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@jrieke @lukasmasuch I believe this is another instance where using a `key` as the widget id would help, because looking at the code it seems like we have this (reverse)

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nCloses #9415 \r\n\r\nIn #9415, we have discovered that the current implementation of Streamlit's `session_state.filtered_state` property / function is kind of slow,

This PR introduces a wrapper-dict that keeps the original dict as well as the reversed version in sync.\r\n\r\nThe example app of #9415 takes ~300ms to run on the current `develop` version and ~130ms to run with this PR's version:\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 11 18 17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7636e660-3a03-4210-8de3-b79da94682bb)\r\n![Screenshot 2024-09-16 at 11 18 00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/841ace1c-139d-4ecc-bfa3-f3c9fd28e90a)\r\n\r\nWith the following check added to the test app:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nst.write(f\"Session state map size: {sys.getsizeof(ctx.session_state.filtered_state)}\")\r\n```\r\nthe size of the newly added map is ~9kb (same as the existing map `_key_id_map`; so we double the map's memory footprint, but it seems to be very small in general).\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Explanation of why no additional tests are needed\r\n- Unit Tests (JS and/or Python)\r\n  - Add unit tests for the new wrapper dict\r\n- E2E Tests\r\n- Any manual testing needed?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you

Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.\n- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nIf you change any parameter of a widget in Streamlit (e.g. the label or the default value), Streamlit will treat it as a new widget and reset its state. That’s necessary because we determine which widget state belongs to which widget based on the parameters. (Note that there are a few exceptions to this rule, e.g. changing the `disabled` parameter will not reset the widget). \n\nBut we still do this when you manually set `key`! Even though in that case, we can easily associate the widget state with the widget based on the `key`. We should change that and always preserve the widget identity if `key` is set. \n\n### Why?\n\nThis (potentially) fixes lots of small issues such as:\n\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1532\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4854\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6352\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7054\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7749\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/7855\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8410\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8496\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8882\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9402\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9415\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9657\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10181\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/10843\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11268\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12165\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9527\n- https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12392\n- With zoom events on charts/maps, this could unblock use cases where you dynamically want to load data while zooming in.\n\n### How?\n\nWe need to be careful here since this *might* break apps. Probably needs a bit of investigation. \n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11277/reactions","total_count":25,"+1":25,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
