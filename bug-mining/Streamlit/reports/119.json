Click on `check key state page` in the sidebar\n3. Choose some value other than `A`, say `B`\n4. Choose `layout2`\n5. See that the state value is `B`\n6. Choose `layout1` again\n7. See that the app now displays `A`, but the state value is `B`\n\nFor example,\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2d09e2-16ca-44c0-ac6e-b433f063dea0)\n\nHowever, if you do `streamlit run check_key_state.py` directly, then this inconsistency issue does not come up. Unfortunately, in this case the choice `B` is forgotten.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSession state and display should be consistent.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nSession state and display are inconsistent.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.44.1\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Operating System: Linux & Windows\n- Browser: Edge\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI actually prefer the new behavior where the session state value is preserved (i.e. the choice of B is retained) upon a redraw. This is a great improvement, if only the display is consistent with the internal value. Thank you.\n\nNote: when I say this used to work in a previous version (1.43.2), I meant that the display and state were consistent, not that the choice was retained (it wasn't).","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11202/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
