Summary\r\n\r\n@AnOctopus Please see a video here: https://youtu.be/Jgp2hh26nwM. This is a follow-up to my post in #3873.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI don't really have a code snippet to reproduce, but I think the [public version of the app](https://share.streamlit.io/ryanlampkin/smg-invest-with-code/main) will reproduce the error with the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Select sidebar menu option \"Finalize and Run\"\r\n2. Check \"Agree to Terms and Conditions\" (sidebar)\r\n3. Press \"Run Simulator\" button\r\n4. -- (allow process to complete. about 1 min)\r\n5. -- (should complete as expected)\r\n6. Repeat steps 2 & 3\r\n\r\nAfter Step 6 is when a KeyError is thrown stating a particular `session_state` is not set. (A `session_state` that was required for the first successful run.)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nI would expect Steps 4 & 5 to proceed on second run.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nSee youtube video above.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nThat is, did this use to work the way you expected in the past?\r\nYes. I previously ran 0.87, and I think this might be related to 0.89 update\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.0.0\r\n- Python version: 3.8.0\r\n- Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? No\r\n- OS version: Windows 10 (whatever the latest is)\r\n- Browser version: Brave

Summary\r\n\r\nIf a widget's value is set by modifying the session state the widget does not update.\r\n\r\nThe [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) state\r\n\r\n> We can set and get the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIf you take the example stated in the docs that works fine and sets the value, but only for the first run\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nif \"celsius\" not in st.session_state:\r\n    # set the initial default value of the slider widget\r\n    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0\r\n\r\nst.slider(\r\n    \"Temperature in Celsius\",\r\n    min_value=-100.0,\r\n    max_value=100.0,\r\n    key=\"celsius\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n# This will get the value of the slider widget\r\nst.write(st.session_state.celsius)\r\n```\r\nIf you modify the session state before the widget is \"initialized\" the GUI does not update,\r\nbut the actual value returned from the widget is the one set.\r\n\r\ne.g. with the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport datetime\r\n\r\ndef cbk_text_input():\r\n    st.write('callback text')\r\n    st.write(datetime.datetime.now())\r\n\r\ndef cbk_slider():\r\n    st.write('callback slider')\r\n    st.write(datetime.datetime.now())\r\n\r\nif 'id_input' not in st.session_state:\r\n    st.session_state['id_input'] = ''\r\n\r\nif 'my_slider' not in st.session_state:\r\n    st.session_state['my_slider'] = 5\r\n\r\n# these values do not reflect in the GUI,\r\n# but they do in the actual value returned from the widget\r\nst.session_state['id_input'] = 'sdf'\r\nst.session_state['my_slider'] = 50\r\n\r\nanswer = st.text_input(f'', value='', \r\n                            key='id_input',\r\n                            on_change=cbk_text_input)\r\n\r\nx = st.slider('some slider', key='my_slider',\r\n                         min_value=0,\r\n                         max_value=100,\r\n                         value=4,\r\n                         step=5,\r\n                         on_change=cbk_slider)\r\n\r\nanswer\r\nst.session_state['id_input']\r\nx\r\nst.session_state['my_slider']\r\n```\r\nBut I would expect the widget to also reflect a \"manual\" change to the session state.\r\nI would have expected the slider to move and the text box to change its content.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nno clue\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.0.0\r\n-
