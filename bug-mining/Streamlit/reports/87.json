Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\r\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nWhen I make a recording with  st.audio_input and use st.audio to play it the input from st.audio_input is played at high speed and then repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nIn the documentation example for st.audio:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\naudio_value = st.audio_input(\"Record a voice message\")\r\n\r\nif audio_value:\r\n    st.audio(audio_value)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reproduce on Firefox:\r\n- attach a mono USB microphone (I have a GoMic from Samson)\r\n- goto: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.audio_input\r\n- record and make a single sound like clicking your tongue\r\n- stop the recording\r\n- play the recording from st.audio (playing from the input device works correctly)\r\n\r\nOn Edge it works correctly.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect to hear the sound made during the recording played at normal speed and only once.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite clicking my tongue a single time I hear two clicks and the recording sounds like it is sped up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/widgets/st.audio_input accessed at 6 november 2024 \r\n- Browser: Firefox \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nMy firefox version is: Versie 132.0.1 (64-bits) on Windows10.","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9799/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
