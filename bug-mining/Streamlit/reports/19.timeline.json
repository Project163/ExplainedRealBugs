Summary\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3132 .\r\n\r\nAn internal check to see if streamlit is running in development mode or not. This checks if some strings are present in the script's file path. This check is not valid for other installation types, e.g. bazel.\r\n\r\nThe script path in a bazel build is for example:\r\n`/home/{user}/.cache/bazel/_bazel_{user}/b775940771a888524b9eed82a7f43708/execroot/{organization}/bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/apps/daq/streamlit_main.runfiles/pip_deps_pypi__streamlit/streamlit/hello/hello.py`\r\n\r\nThis could be solved by also checking for \"pip_deps_pypi__streamlit\" in the development_mode check, or by just having a better check in general.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\nstreamlit_main.py\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom streamlit import cli as stcli\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    sys.argv = [\"streamlit\", \"hello\"]\r\n    sys.exit(stcli.main())\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBUILD.bazel\r\n```python\r\nload(\"@rules_python//python:defs.bzl\", \"py_binary\")\r\n\r\npy_binary(\r\n    name = \"streamlit_main\",\r\n    srcs = [\r\n        \"streamlit_main.py\",\r\n    ],\r\n    main = \"streamlit_main.py\",\r\n    visibility = [\"//visibility:public\"],\r\n    deps = [\r\n        requirement('streamlit')\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n```\r\nIf applicable, please provide the steps we should take to reproduce the bug:\r\n\r\nrun \"bazel build streamlit_main\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nTo not run in development mode;\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nRuns in development mode. \r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 1.8.1\r\n- Python version: 3.7\r\n- Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? BAZEL\r\n- OS version: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- Browser version:\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWorkaround: explicitly set developmentMode to false:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom streamlit import cli as stcli\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    sys.argv = [\"streamlit\", \"hello\", \"--global.developmentMode\", \"0\"]\r\n

'server.enableCORS' is being overridden to 'true'.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nIn order to protect against CSRF attacks, we send a cookie with each request.\r\nTo do so, we must specify allowable
