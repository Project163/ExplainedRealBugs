for reporting this issue! I have been able to reproduce it. I believe its because the web app sends an update message but since the fragment has not been included in the app run anymore, the fragment id is missing. Probably the right way for us is to keep track of whether an update is coming from the `rerun_every` behavior and ignore the error in that case or notify the web app about the removal somehow, although this might lead to a race condition between the two messages 🤔 \r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nAs a workaround, you should be able to put a `try-except` block around your `fragment` annotated block:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n  @st.experimental_fragment(run_every=0.1)\r\n  def counter():\r\n    st.write(f\"timer: {st.session_state.i}\")\r\n    st.session_state.i += 1\r\nexcept Exception as ex:\r\n  print(ex)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, this will hide any other issues going on as well, so I don't recomment this as a general advice 🙂 \r\nYou could also catch the `FragmentStorageKeyError` from `streamlit.errors` to lower the blast-radius of the except, but please **note** that we do not guarantee this to be a stable import path across releases; so the import could change in the future.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2230528465/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13599164898,"node_id":"LE_lADODCoeTs6PZ64izwAAAAMqksni","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/13599164898","actor":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-22T10:32:38Z","label":{"name":"feature:st.fragment","color":"C5DEF5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-31T11:03:08Z","updated_at":"2024-07-31T11:03:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9183","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9183/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9183/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9183/events","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/9183","id":2439767296,"node_id":"PR_kwDODCoeTs52-t5N","number":9183,"title":"Don't

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nCloses #9080 \r\n\r\nWhen a fragment is scheduled via `rerun_every` with a small interval, we might run into a race condition when the fragment is removed from the app, e.g. by de-selecting a checkbox. This happens because the `script_runner` on the Python backend might remove the fragment and a `NewSession` message is sent to the web app which informs about the scheduled fragments, ;but before the message reaches the web app, the scheduled interval-runner sends another re-run message. The following flow diagram depicts this: \r\n\r\n![Fragment rerun_every Race Condition - Page 1 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b09c898-f054-4883-adcf-2f05a4fc31d1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- Explanation of why no additional tests are needed\r\n- Unit Tests (JS and/or Python)\r\n  - [JS] Add a unit test to ensure that the RerunScript sent via the `handleAutoRerun` function contains the `is_auto_rerun` flag\r\n  - [Python] Add a unit test to ensure that the `FragmentStorageKeyError` is not raised when the `is_auto_rerun` flag is set on `RerunData`\r\n- E2E Tests\r\n  - Since this relies on an interval and frequent user action (e.g. selecting & deselecting a checkbox as described in #9080) before it happens and, thus, is not completely deterministic, I figure a better approach is to rely on the unit tests.\r\n- Any manual testing needed?\r\n - I tested the user app described in #9080 manually\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0
