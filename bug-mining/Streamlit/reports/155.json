This issue does not occur in version 1.45.0 and below, nor does it affect iOS or desktop platforms. It appears to be a regression related to layout or viewport handling introduced in 1.46.0.\n\n\n\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a minimal Streamlit app:\n\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.title(\"Chat Test\")\nst.write(\"Try asking something below:\")\n\n# Quick options for the user\noptions = [\"What's your name?\", \"What can you do?\", \"Tell me something fun\", \"Help\"]\n\n# Display the pills with a title\nselected_pill = st.pills(\"Quick questions\", options, key=\"selected_pill\")\n\n# Show the selected pill\nif selected_pill:\n    st.write(f\"You selected: {selected_pill}\")\n\n# Chat input\nuser_input = st.chat_input(\"Type your question here\")\n\n# Show the input from chat\nif user_input:\n    st.write(f\"You asked: {user_input}\")\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nRun the app:\nstreamlit run app.py\n\nOpen the app on an Android device using Chrome or Samsung Internet\nObserve that the chat input bar does not appear at all\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected Behavior\nThe st.chat_input() component should render correctly at the bottom of the screen, even on Android mobile browsers, just like it does in version 1.45.0 and in iOS.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nActual Behavior\nOn Android (Brave Browser), the input bar is completely missing.\n\nThe input works fine on iOS and desktop.\nDowngrading to streamlit==1.45.0 makes the issue disappear.\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\nEnvironment Info\nStreamlit version: 1.46.0 (bug), 1.45.0 (works)\n\nPython version: 3.11\n\nOS: Android 12+\n\nBrowsers tested: Brave\nDevices tested: Pixel 5, Samsung Galaxy S23\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe bug may be related to changes in layout behavior (100vh, flex, etc.).\nWe verified with and without custom CSS. Even with minimal layout, the input bar fails to appear in 1.46.0.","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-bnisco","id":178842601,"node_id":"U_kgDOCqjr6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178842601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-bnisco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-bnisco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11722/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
