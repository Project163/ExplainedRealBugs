To further enable UI minimalism / customisation, could we also have the current `values`, and the `max_value`, `min_value` ranges collapsed, as an option, as well?\r\n\r\nAlso, could we apply custom labels for the ranges? For example you might have a slider with range between 0 and 100, with `0` and `100` rendered at each end of the slider - but could we rename these to be something else, for example \"Less\" and \"More\"?\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAdding the argument `value_visibility`, as was done with `label_visibility`?","closed_by":{"login":"jrieke","id":5103165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDMxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5936/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5936/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
