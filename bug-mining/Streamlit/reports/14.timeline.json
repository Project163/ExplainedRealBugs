Yes, it's hacky and uses a private API, so not worth supporting.\r\nIn addition, thanks to your statement \"Callbacks are triggered before the rerun\", I found a workaround for my library: https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-server-state/pull/38, so finally this became no longer a problem for my case.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHowever, as shown in the example above, this problem still exists with a public API `st.experimental_rerun()` and the example is possible code without any alerts.\r\nSo I think the ver. 1 code above is still worth considering to fix anyway.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/928059178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"whitphx","id":3135397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzUzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3135397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx","html_url":"https://github.com/whitphx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whitphx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5460181273,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODCoeTs48BRd5zwAAAAFFc8EZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/5460181273","actor":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-13T22:32:16Z","label":{"name":"waiting on user response","color":"e99695"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/942772105","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3854#issuecomment-942772105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3854","id":942772105,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs44MY-J","user":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-13T22:39:50Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T22:39:56Z","body":"Thanks for the additional info @whitphx.\r\n\r\nAs `experimental_rerun` is still in the `experimental` namespace, a fix for this may not end up being the highest priority for us.

Summary\r\n\r\nValues of components which appear after `st.experimental_rerun()` are not restored but initialized after executing `st.experimental_rerun()`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n[![Open in Streamlit Cloud](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/?issue=gh-3533)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nradio_value = st.radio(\"Select1\", [\"Egg\", \"Spam\", \"Bacon\", \"Sausage\"])\r\nst.write(radio_value)\r\n\r\nif st.button(\"Rerun\"):\r\n    st.experimental_rerun()\r\n\r\nradio_value = st.radio(\"Select2\", [\"Egg\", \"Spam\", \"Bacon\", \"Sausage\"])\r\nst.write(radio_value)\r\n\r\nradio_value = st.radio(\"Select3\", [\"Egg\", \"Spam\", \"Bacon\", \"Sausage\"])\r\nst.write(radio_value)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. At first, all radio values are \"Egg\"\r\n2. Change the selections; for example, \"Spam\", \"Bacon\", and \"Sausage\" for 3 radios respectively. Now, each radio button and its successive `st.write()` shows the selected item name.\r\n3. Click the \"Rerun\" button. This triggers `st.experimental_rerun()`\r\n4. After `st.experimental_rerun()`, **the second and third `st.write()`'s outputs are reset to \"Egg\"** (radio buttons selections are visually not changed though).\r\n\r\n* Rerunning without `st.experimental_rerun()` fixes this wrong state. For example, after changing the selection of some radio button which causes the script to rerun, all the component values are restored properly again.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nAt step 4 above, all component values are restored properly so that the second `st.write()` shows \"Bacon\" and the third \"Sausage\".\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nAs explained above, at step 4, the second and third `st.write()` show wrong restored component values.\r\n<img width=\"383\" alt=\"bug_rerun_·_Streamlit\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3135397/125149061-9ad2ea80-e171-11eb-8ddf-68c271df4cff.png\">\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nThat is, did this use to work the way you expected in the past?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: `Streamlit, version 0.83.0`\r\n- Python version: `Python 3.8.7`\r\n- Using Conda?

to doc page in question (if any):**\r\nhttps://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/control-flow/st.experimental_rerun\r\n**Name of the Streamlit feature whose docs need improvement:**\r\nst.experimental_rerun\r\n**What you think the docs should say:**\r\nI have encountered a puzzling warning using `st.button` callback functions. The warning states:\r\n`Calling st.experimental_rerun() within a callback is a no-op.`\r\n\r\nI can't find any information about this warning except this pull request which appears to implement the warning [Make calling st.experimental_rerun() within a callback a no-op](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3934) which closes this issue: [Rerunning the session does not work inside callbacks](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3854).\r\n\r\nThe simple test app I made using the following code triggers this warning (when buttons are pressed in succession) even though `st.experimental_rerun` is not explicitly run anywhere:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\ndef left_callback():\r\n    st.write('Left button was clicked')\r\n\r\ndef right_callback():\r\n    st.write('Right button was clicked')\r\n\r\nleft_col, right_col, _ = st.columns([1, 1, 3])\r\n\r\nwith left_col:\r\n    st.button('LEFT', on_click=left_callback)\r\n\r\nwith right_col:\r\n    st.button('RIGHT', on_click=right_callback)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears that it is an issue with session state and callbacks not properly working together or the app being re-run inside one of the callbacks under the hood.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add information about possible warnings that `st.experimental_rerun()` may trigger, including this one I have mentioned. Or add a functionality to suppress the warning. I don't think this is a bug, so I submit this as a documentation improvement in the hopes of getting some answers about why this warning is triggered.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/docs/issues/422/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/docs/issues/422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
