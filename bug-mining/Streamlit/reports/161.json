Upon further inspection it seems that the websocket connection was often considered closed.\n\nThe cause seems to lie in the `ping_timeout` saga (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3196, https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/pull/3376, https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11670).\n\nForcing Tornado to 6.4.2 (while still keeping streamlit on 1.47.0) solves the issue because the conditional sets the `websocket_ping_interval` to 1s again. We run Streamlit in a Docker container with Nginx, so a proxy setup applies.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nn/a\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nStreamlit 1.47.0 in a Docker container with Nginx\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nStability with a higher `websocket_ping_interval` server setting (e.g. 30s).\nAllowing for more recent versions of Tornado (> 6.4.2) to be used.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nStreamlit instability with a higher `websocket_ping_interval` server setting\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.47.0\n- Tornado version: 6.5.1\n- Python version: 3.12.5\n- Operating System: Linux\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nOriginally this Streamlit issue https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3196 was reported and solved/merged with `\"websocket_ping_interval\": 1` on 23 jun 2021.\n\nA recent Tornado issue on https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/pull/3376 came to disallow the `websocket_ping_interval` to be below the `websocket_ping_timeout` of 30s. This update was merged/released on 22 april 2025 (Tornado 6.5.1). \n\nThe Tornado update - allowing the `websocket_ping_interval` gave trouble to some Streamlit users, reported 17 jun 2025: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11670. This Streamlit issue was eventually solved by the current code: `\"websocket_ping_interval\": 1 if is_tornado_version_less_than(\"6.5.0\") else 30,`\nWith the update, @lukasmasuch remarked: `This could potentially bring back an old issue with dropping connections in specific proxy setups - #3196. Something we need to watch out for after this gets released.`\n\nIt seems our Streamlit setup is suffering from this regression. Forcing Tornado to 6.4.2 (while still keeping streamlit on 1.47.0) solves the issue because the conditional sets the `websocket_ping_interval` to 1s again.","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12108/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
