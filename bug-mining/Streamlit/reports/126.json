Right now if a formula is longer than the viewport the whole app will get a scrollbar, which looks kinda ugly. (see attachments)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add a long LaTeX formula (like `r\"Full\\ load\\ hours_{source} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{8760} production_{source}}{capacity_{source}} = 8760 \\times Capacity\\ factor_{source}\"`)\r\n2. Decrease the width of the browser viewport\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nI would expect the formula to get a scrollbar so you could nicely scroll through the formula without affecting the whole screen.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe whole app becomes wider and a scrollbar appears at the bottom of the page. The problem seems to be solved by adding `overflow-x` to `.stMarkdown`, but I don't know enough about this to create a PR myself.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nI don't know, I've been using Streamlit for only a few days. :) \r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: v1.4.0\r\n- Browser version: Safari (both desktop and mobile) and Chrome\r\n\r\n<img width=\"376\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2022-01-20 om 13 58 36\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25854734/150344892-ce257282-2d2b-44ef-85d2-aa90659423af.png\">\r\n<img width=\"379\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2022-01-20 om 13 58 46\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25854734/150344928-d22c0187-4d25-457c-aa2e-c81d40b25999.png\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCommunity voting on feature requests enables the Streamlit team to understand which features are most important to our users.\r\n\r\n**If you'd like the Streamlit team to prioritize this feature request, please use the 👍 (thumbs up emoji) reaction in response to the initial post.**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
