Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\r\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nWhen viewing the docs on mobile, the embedded example of `st.data_editor` jitters with an interior scrollbar rapidly appearing and disappearing.\r\n\r\n![data_editor mobile jitter](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/assets/98661771/5a357529-228e-493d-81f3-ce18bc489b8d)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n(On Chrome on a Google Pixel 5)\r\n1. Go to https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/data/st.data_editor\r\n2. Look at the second example (first one with dynamic rows)\r\n3. Data editor jitters as in gif above\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should have a steady display.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIt jitters as shown in the recording.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: (currently nightly, I think)\r\n- Python version: 3.9\r\n- Operating System: Android 13 (latest at time of posting)\r\n- Browser: Chrome 114.0.5735.130 (latest at time of posting) also DuckDuckGo\r\n- Virtual environment: n/a\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce the jitter in Chrome or Firefox in Windows (with simulated mobile dimensions).\r\n\r\nI *was* able to reproduce the bug in DuckDuckGo on the same Google Pixel 5 device. I could also reproduce the issue in Chrome on a Galaxy Note 8.\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, I am willing to submit a PR!","closed_by":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6900/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6900/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
