Neither the original order nor alphabetical order seems to be preserved. This means (when case-sensitivity is considered), that someone can type in an item correctly, press enter, and get the wrong item selected.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nmulti = st.multiselect(\"C\", accept_new_options=True, options=[\"aa\", \"Aa\", \"aA\"])\nmulti\n\nsingle = st.selectbox(\"D\", index=None, accept_new_options=True, options=[\"bb\", \"Bb\", \"bB\"])\nsingle\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run the app\n2. In the multiselect, type `a a Enter` and get `aA` selected instead.\n3. In the selectbox, type `b b Enter` and get `bB` selected instead.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf an exact (case-sensitive) match exists, it should be selected when pressing enter.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.44.2.dev20250424\n- Python version: 3.13\n- Operating System: Mac\n- Browser: Prisma\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11218/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
