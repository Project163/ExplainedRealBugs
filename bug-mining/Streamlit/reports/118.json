I am experimenting with an app to display a small table and edit it in Postgre.\n\nI have hit this [index out of bounds error message](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/2db9936d4a9c8f178a2ae340fa4c27f3a8b4a941/frontend/lib/src/components/widgets/DataFrame/hooks/useDataLoader.ts#L61)\n\n<img width=\"753\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eefacbb-01e7-4021-9926-3f0f81a3d362\" />\n\nI am only reporting it because it asked so politely.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nfrom utils import get_db_connection, fetch_widgets, get_s3_client, S3_BUCKET\n\nst.header(\"Add New Widget & View Table\")\n\n# Load widgets data (cached in session state so we query only once per page load)\nif \"widgets_df\" not in st.session_state:\n    try:\n        st.session_state.widgets_df = fetch_widgets()\n    except Exception as e:\n        st.error(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n\nst.subheader(\"Widgets Table\")\nst.dataframe(st.session_state.widgets_df)\n\nst.subheader(\"Add New Widget\")\n\nwith st.form(\"widget_form\", clear_on_submit=True):\n    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)\n    with col1:\n        height = st.number_input(\"Height\", min_value=0.0, format=\"%.2f\", step=0.1)\n        width = st.number_input(\"Width\", min_value=0.0, format=\"%.2f\", step=0.1)\n    with col2:\n        length = st.number_input(\"Length\", min_value=0.0, format=\"%.2f\", step=0.1)\n        quantity = st.number_input(\"Quantity\", min_value=1, step=1)\n    with col3:\n        color = st.selectbox(\"Color\", options=[\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"])\n        notes = st.text_area(\"Notes\")\n    # Marking the upload as optional in the label\n    file = st.file_uploader(\"Upload File (Optional)\", type=[\"txt\", \"csv\", \"png\", \"jpg\", \"jpeg\", \"pdf\"])\n    submitted = st.form_submit_button(\"Submit\")\n\nif submitted:\n    try:\n        # Default S3 key to None if no file is provided.\n        s3_key = None\n        if file is not None:\n            # Upload file to S3 using the original filename as the object key\n            s3 = get_s3_client()\n            s3.upload_fileobj(file, Bucket=S3_BUCKET, Key=file.name)\n            s3_key = file.name\n\n        # Insert the new widget into PostgreSQL\n        conn = get_db_connection()\n        cur = conn.cursor()\n        insert_query = \"\"\"\n            INSERT INTO widgets (height, width, length, color, quantity, notes, s3_key)\n            VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)\n        \"\"\"\n        cur.execute(insert_query, (height, width, length, color, quantity, notes, s3_key))\n        conn.commit()\n        cur.close()\n        conn.close()\n\n        st.success(\"Widget added successfully!\")\n\n        # Refresh the widgets table\n        st.session_state.widgets_df = fetch_widgets()\n        st.dataframe(st.session_state.widgets_df)\n    except Exception as e:\n        st.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n- Print out an empty data frame saved in the session state\n- Use a form to add a row to the dataframe in the session state within a widget\n- Try to click on the old dataframe\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nHonestly idk if this is a bug, it makes sense to me that an error message appears here.\n\nI just reported it because it asked me too.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nError message:\n```\n\"This error should never happen. Please report this bug.\"\n```\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.44.1\n- Python version: 3.12.4\n- Operating System: MacOS 14.7.2\n- Browser: Edge Version 133.0.3065.59\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\nFull disclosure... ChatGPT o3-mini-high created this example. I only included the code for the 1 streamlit page, I hope that is enough, let me know if I should add more info about the code.","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11064/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
