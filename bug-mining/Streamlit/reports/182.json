Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen using st.pills and st.segmented_control:\n- Streamlit 1.47.1 is showing the last pill option with a break (only if a previous control rendered 1 option)\n- See sample below, if you move Pill 2 or Pill 3 above Pill 1 all pills render correctly.\n- Was working ok in previous versions of streamlit\n\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\n# Single option causes pill_2 and pill_3 to incorrectly render (with a break on the last option)\n# Adding an additional option to this pill allows all pills to render correctly\nst.pills('Pill 1', options=[\"1\"], key=\"pill_1\")\nst.pills('Pill 2', options=[\"1\", \"2\"], key=\"pill_2\")\nst.pills('Pill 3', options=[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"], key=\"pill_3\")\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run pill sample code, note pill_2 and pill_3 rendering the last option incorrectly.\n2. Add a second option to pill_1.  Note: pill_2 and pill_3 render correctly\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPills render all options on a single line when there is space\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nIncorrect rendering\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.47.1\n- Python version: 3.13.5\n- Operating System: MacOS and Windows\n- Browser: Chrome\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12067/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
