Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nFrom this discussion: https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/table-convert-material-icon-doesnt-exist/85146\r\n\r\n************\r\n\r\nThere are icons that exist in the Material Symbols docs (for example, [`table_convert`](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:table_convert:FILL@0;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@24&icon.query=table+convert&icon.size=24&icon.color=%235f6368)) but are not recognized by Streamlit:\r\n\r\n`StreamlitAPIException: The value “:material/table_convert:” is not a valid Material icon.`\r\n\r\n******\r\n\r\nThe icon name needs to be in [this set in `material_icon_names.py`](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/lib/streamlit/material_icon_names.py) to be recognized by Streamlit. That set  is generated by [`scripts/update_material_icon_names.py`](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/develop/scripts/update_material_icon_names.py),  which reads the material icon names and codepoints from [this other file in the material-fonts](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/variablefont/MaterialSymbolsRounded%5BFILL%2CGRAD%2Copsz%2Cwght%5D.codepoints) repository.\r\n\r\nBut the last time `material_icon_names.py` was updated in Streamlit's repo was five months ago, so the available codepoints used to generate that set was [likely this version](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/9ab636ffe26db9667fdfc2b883805fe4040b0de9/variablefont/MaterialSymbolsRounded%5BFILL%2CGRAD%2Copsz%2Cwght%5D.codepoints) which did not include, for example, `table_convert` or `table_edit`.\r\n\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\n# OK\r\nst.button(label=\"Table Chart View\", icon=\":material/table_chart_view:\")\r\n\r\n# Raises Exception\r\nst.button(label=\"Table Convert\", icon=\":material/table_convert:\")\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.40\r\n- Python version: 3.12\n\n### Additional Information\n\nDiscuss link:\r\nhttps://discuss.streamlit.io/t/table-convert-material-icon-doesnt-exist/85146","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9810/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
