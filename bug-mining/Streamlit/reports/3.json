Summary\r\n\r\nWhen I load the latest streamlit in darkmode I cannot see anything in my markdown tables because the text color is changed but not the background color.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmd = \"\"\"\r\n| Label     | Info        |\r\n| -------- | --------- |\r\n| Row       | Data      |\r\n\"\"\"\r\nst.markdown(md)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nI would expect if the text color get changed to white in the table, the background color should get changed to something dark\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nBoth the text color and background are white so nothing can be seen.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nno, consequence of new theme\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 0.79.0\r\n- Python version: 3.7.9\r\n- pip\r\n- OS version: MacOS Catalina 10.15.7\r\n- Browser version: Chrome 89.0.4389.90\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why markdown tables have different background style but they seem to; perhaps other ui elements would be affected as well.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
