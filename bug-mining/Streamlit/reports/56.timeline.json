Describe your changes\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a fallback to an old browser download method for CSV dataframe download feature. Some browser or situations might not correctly support the file picker feature, in these cases it will fallback to an older more commonly supported download method.  \r\n\r\nWe also add iframe tests together with CSPs here. This can be used in the future also by other tests.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\n- Closes #8210\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- E2E tests: added e2e tests for downloading a CSV

Checklist\n\n- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [X] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [X] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen a Streamlit app is hosted in an iframe in a different origin than the parent frame, the download button in the dataframe toolbar silently fails with a console error.\r\n\r\nThis is arguably a bug in [the `native-file-system-adapter` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/native-file-system-adapter) used by this widget.\r\n\r\nIt's a little surprising that this has very different behavior from `st.download_button`.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n// Run this snippet with node.\r\n// If saved in `server.js`, run with `node server.js`.\r\nconst http = require(\"http\");\r\n\r\nconst requestListener = function (req, res) {\r\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/html\");\r\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Security-Policy\", \"frame-src http://localhost:3000;\");\r\n    res.writeHead(200);\r\n    res.end('<html><body><h1>App below:</h1><iframe sandbox=\"allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\" src=\"http://localhost:3000\" /></body></html>');\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst host = \"localhost\";\r\nconst port = 3001;\r\nconst server = http.createServer(requestListener);\r\nserver.listen(port, host, () => {\r\n    console.log(`Server is running on http://${host}:${port}`);\r\n});\r\n\r\n# Run as a Streamlit on port 3000.\r\n# If saved in a file `repro.py`, run with `streamlit run repro.py`.\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nratings_df = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    [\r\n        {\"command\": \"st.selectbox\", \"rating\": 4, \"is_widget\": True},\r\n        {\"command\": \"st.balloons\", \"rating\": 5, \"is_widget\": False},\r\n        {\"command\": \"st.time_input\", \"rating\": 3, \"is_widget\": True},\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\nst.dataframe(ratings_df, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run the Streamlit app above.\r\n2. Run the node server above, which iframes the Streamlit app cross-origin.\r\n3. Open the node server in chrome ([localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)).\r\n4. Hover over the dataframe table.\r\n5.
