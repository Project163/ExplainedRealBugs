Removing this property results in the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\nsender_email = st.text_input('username', value='user', key='email')\r\nsender_password = st.text_input('password', type='password', key='password')\r\nif st.button('Login'):\r\n    st.success('Logged in')\r\nelse:\r\n    st.write('Not logged in')\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Run the code\r\n2. Notice that 1Password 7 displays for the user field the saved password and for the password field only suggests a new password\r\n3. Fill saved password from the user field. Notice that the password field does not get filled.\r\n4. Reload the page.\r\n5. Remove the `autocomplete=\"new-password\"` property with the web inspector.\r\n6. Fill the password from the user field. Notice that both fields get filled (as expected).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe password manager fills both fields\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe password manager only fills the user field.\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\nDon't know.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version: 0.79.0\r\n- Python version: 3.9.2\r\n- Using Conda? PipEnv? PyEnv? Pex? => Conda\r\n- OS version: macOS 10.15.7\r\n- Browser version: Tested with Safari 14.0.3 and Chrome 89.0.4389.90\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround to remove this HTML property? Or does it required a code change within Streamlit?\r\nFor my tool the user needs to provide a API authentication for the backend (username/password), which will be stored in a password manager (1Password 7) in this case. It is inconvenient having to copy the password manually.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tconkling","id":709022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTAyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/709022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling","html_url":"https://github.com/tconkling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tconkling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
