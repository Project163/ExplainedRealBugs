Here are the results of testing with different versions of Pillow:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n$ pip install pillow==9.0.0\r\n>>> from PIL import Image\r\n>>> Image.Resampling.BILINEAR\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/agilesoda/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/PIL/Image.py\", line 65, in __getattr__\r\n    raise AttributeError(f\"module '{__name__}' has no attribute '{name}'\")\r\nAttributeError: module 'PIL.Image' has no attribute 'Resampling'\r\n\r\n$ pip install pillow==9.1.0\r\n>>> from PIL import Image\r\n>>> Image.Resampling.\r\nImage.Resampling.BICUBIC   Image.Resampling.BOX       Image.Resampling.LANCZOS   Image.Resampling.mro(      \r\nImage.Resampling.BILINEAR  Image.Resampling.HAMMING   Image.Resampling.NEAREST   \r\n>>> Image.Resampling.BILINEAR\r\n<Resampling.BILINEAR: 2>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on this, it appears that the Pillow requirement in the [Streamlit requirements](https://github.com/Zerohertz/streamlit-contrib/commit/deca3bd4dd6d43b21adb9ab965a6542c79e1a28a) should be updated to reflect the correct minimum version.\r\nShould I submit a pull request to update this?\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Code Example\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is this a regression?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\r\n\r\n### Debug info\r\n\r\n- Streamlit version:\r\n- Python version:\r\n- Operating System:\r\n- Browser:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8486/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
