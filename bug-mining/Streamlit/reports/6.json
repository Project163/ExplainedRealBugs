I locally replicated it, and the cause is the Pandas `Index` type being used as the source of options, but not having an `index` method.\r\n\r\nIn 0.83, this was not an issue, because the default values remained `None` throughout the reruns, so we never tried to look up an index. In 0.84, on the second script run, our value lookup is being called with `[\"a\"]` as the default values when serializing the multiselect widget's state.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear if the problem is with our handling of values in serialization, or if instead this should be fixed by more aggressively ensuring the type being indexed supports the needed operations.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AnOctopus","id":7356217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTYyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7356217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus","html_url":"https://github.com/AnOctopus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AnOctopus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
