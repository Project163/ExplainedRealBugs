The content inside the box closes when interacting with it, but the title and the dialog box itself remain open. \n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\n@st.experimental_dialog(\"Test Dialog\")\r\ndef dialog_box():\r\n    st.markdown(\"Hello world\")\r\n    if st.button(\"Do something\")\r\n        st.markdown(\"Did it\")\r\n    if st.button(\"Close\"):\r\n        st.rerun()\r\n\r\n@st.experimental_fragment\r\ndef fragment():\r\n    if st.button(\"Open Dialog\"):\r\n        dialog_box() \r\n\r\nfragment()\n```\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to \"Open Dialog\"\r\n2. Click on either \"Do something\" or \"Close\" to observe the behavior. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected that the dialog box would be able to function within a fragment and that the close and rerun, would in fact close the dialog box. \n\n### Current Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.34.0\r\n- Python version: 3.9.18\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- Browser: Firefox\r\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8635/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/8635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
