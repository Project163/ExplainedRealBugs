thanks for the suggestion! It may, unfortunately, be a bit more difficult to include custom pydeck layers since we would need to figure out a way to dynamically grab the required javascript and inject it into the streamlit frontend (I'm not totally familiar with how the earthengine layer works -- this is a best-guess as to what would be involved from what I've gleaned from the issue that you linked) . This would be a departure from the way most of our frontend dependencies work since, as far as I know, all of them are statically bundled when we create a streamlit wheel.\r\n\r\nI would recommend opening a new issue for this feature request since it's likely to be significantly more involved than getting a core pydeck layer to work.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/953462108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vdonato","id":3144420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDQ0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3144420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato","html_url":"https://github.com/vdonato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vdonato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5531189006,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs489wopzwAAAAFJrz8O","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/5531189006","actor":{"login":"giswqs","id":5016453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTY0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5016453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs","html_url":"https://github.com/giswqs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T03:04:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5531189012,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs489wopzwAAAAFJrz8U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/5531189012","actor":{"login":"giswqs","id":5016453,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTY0NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5016453?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs","html_url":"https://github.com/giswqs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giswqs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-28T03:04:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/954033087","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3895#issuecomment-954033087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/3895","id":954033087,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs443WO_","user":{"login":"kylebarron","id":15164633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTY0NjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15164633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron","html_url":"https://github.com/kylebarron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylebarron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-28T17:02:08Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T17:02:08Z","body":"You
