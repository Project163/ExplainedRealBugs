`show_spinner` argument as boolean. However it also accepts a string. It should be updated to reflect the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/performance/st.cache_data\r\n\r\nI believe it works the same as cache_resource, so it could copy that docstring.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.19\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to submit a PR?\n\n- [X] Yes, I am willing to submit a PR!","closed_by":{"login":"kajarenc","id":6664805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6664805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc","html_url":"https://github.com/kajarenc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajarenc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/6207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
