When my app throws an exception, it should be easy to copy-to-clipboard with one click. \n\n### Why?\n\nI spend a lot of time copying exceptions out of apps to figure out what to do with them. Loveable has a very sophiscated flow of pushing exceptions into your LLM so that you can fix them and I am often implementing a manual version of that. \n\nHowever, I need to support a variety of use-cases such as:\n* pasting the exception into the LLM my company has approved, which is not always in the same place as my streamlit app\n* pasting exceptions into bug tickets\n* putting the exception into my exception menagerie \n\n### How?\n\nOne of those hover clipboard buttons on the red thrown exception box would be awesome\n\n<img width=\"571\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bdfeb04-90d3-42fc-81e9-ad8170fbe231\" />\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11083/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11083/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
