Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen configuring a streamlit app using `client.showErrorDetails = \"stacktrace\"` (or any other string value) deprecation warnings are still shown in the browser even though according the documentation they shouldn't. Using the deprecated value `false` successfully hides the warnings.\n\nThis implementation seems to still rely on boolean values instead of the new `ShowErrorDetailsConfigOptions` enum:\nhttps://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/bb4d1088707f08e2a1ef969df8de90bfc67eefd7/lib/streamlit/deprecation_util.py#L30-L32\n\nNot reproducible in version `1.49.0`\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport streamlit as st\n\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(\n    go.Scatter(\n        x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n        y=[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]\n    )\n)\n\nst.plotly_chart(fig, width=\"stretch\") # Trigger deprecation warning by not using config\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Use deprecated code\n2. Configure `client.showErrorDetails = \"stacktrace\"`\n3. Run app\n4. Observe deprecation warnings in browser\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nAccording to the documentation \n\n> \\# - \"stacktrace\" : In the browser, Streamlit displays exceptions,\n> \\# including exception types, generic exception messages,\n> \\# and associated tracebacks. Deprecation warnings and\n> \\# full exception messages will only print to the\n> \\# console.\n> [...]\n> \\# - False : This is deprecated. Streamlit displays \"stacktrace\"\n\n- `client.showErrorDetails = \"stacktrace\"` should hide deprecation warnings in the browser\n- `client.showErrorDetails = false` should behave exactly the same way.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n- `client.showErrorDetails = \"stacktrace\"` does not hide deprecation warnings in the browser\n- `client.showErrorDetails = false` hides deprecation warnings in the browser\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.50.0\n- Python version: 3.13.7\n- Operating System: macOS 26.0.1\n- Browser: Safari 26.0.1 \n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12743/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
