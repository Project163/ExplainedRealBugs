After an upgrade (and after testing with several versions), somewhere between `1.43.1` and `1.44.1`, this behavior changed and now there is a blank \"init\" page in the navbar. \n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\n\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nCan be reproduced by setting up a structure like so, and running `streamlit run mainpage.py` on 1.43.1 vs 1.44.1:\n\n.\n└── appname/\n    ├── appname/\n    │   ├── pages/\n    │   │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   │   ├── page1.py\n    │   │   └── page2.py\n    │   ├── mainpage.py\n    │   └── __init__.py\n    ├── README.md\n    └── poetry.lock\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected that `__init__.py`/\"init\" should not be listed in pages.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\n1.43.1:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77711fee-f5b2-45f6-ac4c-458926b7d343)\n\n1.44.1\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e31b4f87-780b-4e2c-9642-f1a8e8b2a783)\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [x] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.44.1\n- Python version: 3.10.12\n- Operating System: Ubuntu/Docker\n- Browser: Edge\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kmcgrady","id":69432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady","html_url":"https://github.com/kmcgrady","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmcgrady/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11006/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
