The example I provided might not have been very good. I used the `st.button` example as a quick way to replicate the error.

\r\n\r\n@raethlein, https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/commit/485ec8d64a1b2c6b6662ad140d99447a185d3bb2 changed `ScriptControlException` type from a `BaseException` to an `Exception` between 1.36 and 1.37, which is causing the reported behavior change by the users. I can't see a good reason why it _should_ be `Exception`, as it's functionally similar to a `KeyboardInterrupt` of sorts, which inherits from `BaseException`.\r\n\r\n@Panosero the workaround here is such:\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n# import streamlit_qs as stqs\r\nimport streamlit.runtime.scriptrunner.exceptions\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ndef counter():\r\n    for x in range(3):\r\n        st.write(x)\r\n        time.sleep(1)\r\n    st.rerun()\r\n\r\n\r\nif st.button(\"notry\"):\r\n    counter()\r\n\r\nif st.button(\"try\"):\r\n    try:\r\n        counter()\r\n    except

Yep absolutely! Though I have just refreshed my mind and read a little bit about the exception types and based on the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) \"[...] programmers are encouraged to derive new exceptions from the [Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception) class or one of its subclasses, and not from [BaseException](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException).\"  and the [Python tutorial docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#tut-userexceptions) say:\r\n> [BaseException](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException) is the common base class of all exceptions. One of its subclasses, [Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception), is the base class **of all the non-fatal exceptions**. Exceptions which are not subclasses of [Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception) are not typically handled, because they are used to indicate that the program should terminate. They include [SystemExit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit) which is raised by [sys.exit()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit) and [KeyboardInterrupt](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt) which is raised when a user wishes to interrupt the program.\r\n\r\nTo me this sounds like deriving from `BaseException` would not necessarily be the right thing to do, because the `ScriptControlException` is not fatal to the program itself. However, of course, the counterpoint is that this is how the library has worked until the change. What do you think about this?\r\nI will also bring it up with the rest of the team and let them chime in.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/2256547060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13684199540,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs6RDKp2zwAAAAMvpFB0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/13684199540","actor":{"login":"Asaurus1","id":5677417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Nzc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5677417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1","html_url":"https://github.com/Asaurus1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-29T17:42:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13684199551,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs6RDKp2zwAAAAMvpFB_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/13684199551","actor":{"login":"Asaurus1","id":5677417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Nzc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5677417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1","html_url":"https://github.com/Asaurus1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Asaurus1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-29T17:42:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13684405399,"node_id":"LE_lADODCoeTs6RDKp2zwAAAAMvp3SX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/13684405399","actor":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-29T18:01:15Z","label":{"name":"feature:st.rerun","color":"C5DEF5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13684406819,"node_id":"UNLE_lA

Describe your changes\r\n\r\nCloses #9155, #9182\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I changed the base class of `ScriptControlException` in https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/commit/485ec8d64a1b2c6b6662ad140d99447a185d3bb2 from `BaseException` to `Exception`. This broke a bunch of user apps because `st.rerun` started to not work in `try-except` blocks anymore when `Exception` was caught. We use `BaseException` again after some discussion to avoid the exception being caught in the accidentally.\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue Link (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Testing Plan\r\n\r\n- E2E Tests\r\n  - Add a test to ensure that the base class won't be changed unnoticeably again in the future\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Contribution License Agreement**\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request you agree that all contributions to this project are made under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/9167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13693031845,"node_id":"CE_lADODCoeTs6RDKp2zwAAAAMwKxWl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/13693031845","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-30T09:33:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13693031866,"node_id":"CE_lADODCoeTs6RDKp2zwAAAAMwKxW6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/13693031866","actor":{"login":"raethlein","id":3775781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzU3ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3775781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein","html_url":"https://github.com/raethlein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raethlein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b703861df9983ab49d21893ee587b54528f63837","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/commits/b703861df9983ab49d21893ee587b54528f63837","created_at":"2024-07-30T09:33:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
