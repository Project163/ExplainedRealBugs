Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar issues.\n- [x] I added a very descriptive title to this issue.\n- [x] I have provided sufficient information below to help reproduce this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe `st.multiselect` ignores `placeholder` parameter when `options` is an empty list ( or empty sequence in general) . This is even more prominent when using `accept_new_options=True`, as the input is not disabled then.\n\n### Reproducible Code Example\n\n```Python\nimport streamlit as st\n\nfoo = st.multiselect(\n    \"Select Foo\",\n    options=[],\n    accept_new_options=True,\n    placeholder=\"foo placeholder\",\n)\n\n\nbar = st.multiselect( # works correctly\n    \"Select Bar\",\n    options=[\"bar1\", \"bar2\", \"bar3\"],\n    accept_new_options=True,\n    placeholder=\"bar placeholder\",\n)\n```\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Run the example provided\n2. Compare the rendered placeholder with passed parameters\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Select Foo input placeholder should be `foo placeholder` not `Add options`. \n\n### Current Behavior\n\nThe first multiselect has the default placeholder.\n<img width=\"931\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb497e1b-db33-4d7f-8f45-81ae45ac33b1\" />\n\n### Is this a regression?\n\n- [ ] Yes, this used to work in a previous version.\n\n### Debug info\n\n- Streamlit version: 1.45.1\n- Python version: 3.13.2\n- Operating System: MacOs 15.5\n- Browser: Firefox 139.0.4, Chrome 137.0.7151.104\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11609/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/11609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
