🤔 Question: Is This Expected Behavior?\n\nI've created a reproduction app for this issue, but before confirming it as a bug, I'd like input from the team on whether this is the intended behavior.\n\n[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlitapp.com/gh-12745)\n\n**Direct link:** https://issues.streamlitapp.com/gh-12745\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n`st.data_editor` infers column types from the pandas DataFrame's **dtype**, not from the `column_config`. When:\n1. User enters integer values (e.g., 1, 2) into a number column\n2. Pandas automatically coerces the column to `int64` dtype\n3. DataFrame is stored in session_state and passed to `st.data_editor` on rerun\n4. Editor sees `int64` dtype → treats it as integer column → **blocks decimal input**\n\nThis happens even when using `st.column_config.NumberColumn(format='%.1f')`, which suggests float support.\n\n## Question for the Team\n\nHow should we handle this?\n\n### Option 1: Expected Behavior ✅\n- `st.data_editor` is designed to strictly respect DataFrame dtypes\n- `NumberColumn(format='%.1f')` is display-only, not for type enforcement\n- **Action:** Improve documentation to clarify this behavior\n\n### Option 2: Bug 🐛\n- Users reasonably expect `NumberColumn(format='%.1f')` to allow float input\n- Column config should influence editing behavior, not just display\n- Forcing users to manage dtype conversions manually is unintuitive\n- **Action:** Make `NumberColumn` with float format preserve/enforce float dtype\n\n## Workarounds (Demonstrated in App)\n\n1. Explicit dtype conversion: `df.astype({'number': 'float'})`\n2. Initialize with float dtype: `pd.DataFrame(..., dtype='float64')`\n\n---\n\n@jrieke @lukasmasuch - Would appreciate your perspective on this! Should we:\n- Confirm this as a bug and track a fix?\n- Consider it expected behavior and improve docs?\n- Something else (e.g., add `dtype` parameter to column configs)?\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/3397458503/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-lwilby","id":103002751,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiOyfw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103002751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-lwilby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-lwilby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20247137347,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs7Q1ukazwAAAAS20sxD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/20247137347","actor":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-13T13:06:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20247137381,"node_id":"SE_lADODCoeTs7Q1ukazwAAAAS20sxl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/20247137381","actor":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-13T13:06:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20247137414,"node_id":"MEE_lADODCoeTs7Q1ukazwAAAAS20syG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/20247137414","actor":{"login":"jrieke","id":5103165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDMxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke","html_url":"https://github.com/jrieke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrieke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-13T13:06:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20247137441,"nod

you for your consideration!\n\nSadly the proposed solution \"Initialize with float dtype: `pd.DataFrame(..., dtype='float64')`\" does not work for all scenarios, since the constructor only allows a single dtype to be set (from the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame)):\n\n```\ndtype : dtype, default None\n    Data type to force. Only a single dtype is allowed. If None, infer.\n```\n\nIn my case the user has to provide some mixed data (strings and floats), for which I use the `st.data_editor`. But initializing the dataframe with `dtype='float64'` clashes with the intention to use other columns for text:\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf_result = st.data_editor(\n    pd.DataFrame(data=[[None, None], [None, None]], columns=['label', 'number'], dtype='float64'),\n    column_config={\n        # 'label': st.column_config.TextColumn(),\n        'number': st.column_config.NumberColumn(format='%.1f'),\n    },\n)\n```\n\nThis example does not allow text to be entered in the first 'label' column.  \nUncommenting the column config for the label leads to an exception:\n\n```\nstreamlit.errors.StreamlitAPIException: The configured column type text for column label is not compatible for editing the underlying data type ColumnDataKind.FLOAT.\n\nYou have following options to fix this: 1) choose a compatible type 2) disable the column 3) convert the column into a compatible data type.\n\nTraceback:\nFile

\"float\"\n})\n```","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/3404760520/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lukasmasuch","id":2852129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasmasuch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasmasuch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
