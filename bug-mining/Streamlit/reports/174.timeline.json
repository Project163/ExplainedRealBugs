Checklist\n\n- [x] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues) for similar feature requests.\n- [x] I added a descriptive title and summary to this issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nFirst of all: I really like Streamlit, thank you very much to the team especially for the improvements over the past year! The topic I raise was already discussed in the original request, but was closed after the last release. Overall, I would like to have more options to use the top menu bar more flexibly, essentially through:\n\n- The ability to hide individual pages (see #10738, please upvote and comment there!)\n- Direct embedding of pages without a section (see #12243, please upvote and comment there!)\n- st.Button as an additional element (see #12244, please upvote and comment there!)\n\n### Why?\n\nI like the new menu bar because it gives me more space in the sidebar for filters and similar functions. My application has a home page that currently serves as an anchor. Since I have quite a few pages, it would be nice to not list some directly in the menu and only call them up in certain situations (I can also imagine having a chatbot on the home page that leads to certain pages). The current setup limits me here.\n\n### How?\n\nMy menu looks like this:\n\n<img width=\"413\" height=\"121\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f51ff12-f90f-480a-a032-d4b5a34f4bed\" />\n\nI would like to access the landing page directly from the menu without first opening a section. This would require the ability to mix sections and single pages in st.navigation, which is currently not possible. In st.navigation, I would like to have an additional parameter like hide_menu that allows me to show only selected pages in the menu bar and hide others.\n\nFor st.button, I have the following use case: As most of my pages have several filter options and selections, I added a feature to create and store a link in my database that contains the information for a specific page, including all filter settings (it is not possible to keep that in the URL itself). Now, I would like to add a section called \"Links\" in my menu, listing all user-specific links with the filter settings in the background. This way, it is also possible to have two separate links to one page but with different settings. From my perspective, having the option for st.button as a menu item and in the menu bar itself would allow me to open the page again with the required filters.\n\nThe button in the menu bar should be styled in the same way as pages or sections.\n\nAnother use case could be opening a dialog for user settings or general information about the application (e.g., author, version, etc.).\n\n\n###

Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes issue #12243 where pages with empty section headers (\"\") were incorrectly grouped in an unlabeled dropdown in the top navigation. They now appear as individual navigation items when mixed with sectioned pages, matching the behavior of sidebar navigation.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- **Added shared navigation utilities** (`processNavigationStructure`) to ensure consistent handling of empty sections between TopNav and SidebarNav components\r\n- **Refactored TopNav** to use the shared utilities, fixing the bug where empty section pages were grouped incorrectly\r\n- **Refactored SidebarNav** to use the same shared utilities for consistency\r\n- **Updated test IDs** to properly distinguish between individual nav links and dropdown sections\r\n- **Added comprehensive tests**:\r\n  - Unit tests for all navigation utilities\r\n  - E2E test specifically for the mixed empty/named sections scenario\r\n\r\nThere's a couple suggestions @sfc-gh-dmatthews made that I think would be great here, but going to do in a follow up PR for easier review.\r\n1. Accept more than just \"\". Inspiration: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/multipage-apps/overview#how-streamlit-converts-filenames-into-labels-and-titles We should allow various \"empty\" keys so that users can eventually place the single pages where they want (see idea 2)\r\n2. Once we can have multiple empty keys, we can allow the positioning of the single pages among sections should the developer choose to do so.\r\n\r\nAnother followup task could be to change what's getting screenshotted in the test app, or change the test app to use query params instead of checkboxes to avoid snap diffs on changing the options in the test app.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for utils and changed functionality. Added e2e tests. Manually verified.\r\n\r\n## Before/After\r\n\r\n**Before:** Pages with empty section headers appeared in an unlabeled dropdown\r\n**After:** Pages with empty section headers appear as individual navigation items\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport streamlit as st\r\n\r\n# These pages will appear as individual items in top nav\r\npages = {\r\n    \"\": [\r\n        st.Page(\"home.py\", title=\"Home\"),\r\n        st.Page(\"dashboard.py\", title=\"Dashboard\"),\r\n    ],\r\n    \"Admin\": [\r\n        st.Page(\"settings.py\", title=\"Settings\"),\r\n        st.Page(\"users.py\", title=\"Users\"),\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n\r\nst.navigation(pages, position=\"top\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #12243\r\n\r\n🤖 Generated with [Claude

issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nCurrently, the pages argument to `st.navigation` supports two modes:\n- List → renders all pages as flat top-level links\n- Dict → renders each section as a dropdown (collapsible item) in the top navigation, even if the section contains only one page\n\nFrom the docs:\n“If you use position=\"top\", each grouping will be a collapsible item in the navigation menu.” \n\nThis means it is not possible to mix flat (single-page) items and grouped dropdowns at the same time in the top navigation.\n\n\n### Why?\n\nMany apps benefit from a hybrid layout:\n- A few core pages should always be visible as flat links in the top bar.\n- Additional related pages should live under dropdown groups.\n\nCurrently, the only way to achieve this is to hide the built-in navigation (position=\"hidden\") and rebuild a custom header using `st.page_link` + `st.popover`. That works, but it means losing the convenience of st.navigation as a router.\n\n### How?\n\nsupport for a mixed dictionary format where the empty string \"\" acts as a “root” section for flat links:\n```python\npages = {\n    \"\": [   # Flat (root) links\n        st.Page(\"flat1.py\",  title=\"TitleF1\", default=True),\n        st.Page(\"flat2.py\",  title=\"TitleF2\"),\n    ],\n    \"Nested\": [  # Dropdown group\n        st.Page(\"nested1.py\",  title=\"Title1\"),\n        st.Page(\"nested2.py\", title=\"Title2\"),\n    ],\n}\n\npg = st.navigation(pages, position=\"top\")\npg.run()\n```\n\n- Pages in \"\" (root) are rendered as flat top-level buttons.\n- Pages in named sections are rendered in dropdowns, as today.\n- Backward compatibility is preserved: lists work as before, dicts with only named sections work as before.\n\n\n### Additional Context\n\nhttps://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/5889#issuecomment-2222697407","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12381/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19509696936,"node_id":"REFE_lADODCoeTs7GSFLrzwAAAASK3lmo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/events/19509696936","actor":{"login":"sfc-gh-nbellante","id":173713422,"node_id":"U_kgDOClqoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173713422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-nbellante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-nbellante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2fa7773187edf8c294668eae41d03e5c1a631af7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nico-bellante/streamlit/commits/2fa7773187edf8c294668eae41d03e5c1a631af7","created_at":"2025-09-04T16:58:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/comments/3257858026","html_url":"https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12243#issuecomment-3257858026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12243","id":3257858026,"node_id":"IC_kwDODCoeTs7CLvfq","user":{"login":"arnaudmiribel","id":7164864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7164864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel","html_url":"https://github.com/arnaudmiribel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arnaudmiribel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-05T10:23:41Z","updated_at":"2025-09-05T10:23:41Z","body":"Heavy +1 for that.
