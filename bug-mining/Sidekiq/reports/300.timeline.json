Hi Gabriel,\r\n>\r\n> Redis Enterprise Cloud has some architectural differences with OSS Redis, and the global configuration options we expose are limited due to how the shared cluster resources are managed (some documentation [here](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/references/compatibility/config-settings)).  That being said, if the database was configured with a no eviction policy, that policy will be honored and data will not be evicted when the database memory limit is hit.
