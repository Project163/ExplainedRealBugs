stopped the Redis server and observed 2 different stacks, one runs Sidekiq with Ruby MRI, and the other with JRuby. In both of them I got the same error message:\n\n`Error fetching job: Error connecting to Redis`\n\nHowever, when I ran the Redis server again, the MRI version could connect again and work without troubles, while the JRuby one got stuck, and couldn't connect to Redis again. So I had to kill the process and start it again.\n\nI'm wondering if this is something that can be fixed for the JRuby runs, and I need a way to automate the kill/start of such workers when it can't connect to Redis, it shouldn't stuck like that. May be a way to check if the worker is working or stuck?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/192620530","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2866#issuecomment-192620530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2866","id":192620530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjYyMDUzMA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-05T10:45:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T18:25:32Z","body":"@mperham thanks for your efforts, appreciate it. Actually, in my case jobs don't even go to \"enqueued\", sidekiq doesn't even initiate them although he runs in idle. This happens when I restart heroku, means some configs with heroku are lost because if I push the initial code with clean database, everything works just fine.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/192620530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":578757143,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTc4NzU3MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/578757143","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-03-05T10:45:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":578757144,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU3ODc1NzE0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/578757144","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-03-05T10:45:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
