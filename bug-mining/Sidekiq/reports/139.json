Fortunately there was no situation it was really needed until the day the server rebooted. Unfortunately the upstart script had no effect and sidekiq was not started.\n\nAfter some investigations I think I know why this happend:\nThe Ubuntu system probably starts the script using this command `initctl start sidekiq`. The script expects a variable named `index`, but it is not passed when the system calls it on a reboot. So the script fails without starting sidekiq.\n\nI fixed the issue for me by just hardcoding the index in the script, but certainly this is not a general and great solution.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?\n\nThanks\nRobin\n","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
