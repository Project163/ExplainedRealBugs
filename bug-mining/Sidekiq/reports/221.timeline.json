There is a catch-22 here: how do you handle issues in the retry code itself?  I think the easiest thing to do here is to add `rescue nil` to that logger statement (which, it should be noted, is DEBUG level so it won't happen unless you enable `-v`).  Is that a reasonable solution?  Should the logger trap all ENOSPC errors since, by definition, there's no way to log them?","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/424809573/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/425411687","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3979#issuecomment-425411687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3979","id":425411687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTQxMTY4Nw==","user":{"login":"swistak35","id":332289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjI4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35","html_url":"https://github.com/swistak35","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swistak35/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-28T11:52:38Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T11:52:38Z","body":"`rescue nil` for that one `logger` sounds acceptable.
