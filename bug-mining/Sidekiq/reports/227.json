I see people misunderstand this abstraction and place the URL directly in REDIS_PROVIDER frequently.  Add validation that will fail fast if the user makes this mistake.  This is a breaking change and needs to be called out in the changelog loudly.\r\n\r\n```\r\nREDIS_PROVIDER should be set to the name of the variable which contains the Redis URL, not a URL itself.\r\nPlatforms like Heroku will sell addons that publish a *_URL variable.  You need to tell Sidekiq with REDIS_PROVIDER, e.g.:\r\n\r\nREDIS_PROVIDER=REDISTOGO_URL\r\nREDISTOGO_URL=redis://somehost.example.com:6379/4\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3969/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
