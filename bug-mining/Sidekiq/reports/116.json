After a period of outage, Sidekiq recovers and the process continues. However, the Web UI (which presumably drops the process upon timeout) does not reflect the worker's presence and continued operation.\n\nThis is represented in the log as follows:\n\n```\n2014-08-07T04:05:21Z 20146 TID-157nm2 ERROR: Error fetching message: Connection timed out\n2014-08-07T04:05:21Z 20146 TID-157nm2 ERROR: /home/ubuntu/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2@w2v/gems/redis-3.0.7/lib/redis/client.rb:222:in `rescue in io'\n...remainder of stack trace omitted for brevity...\n2014-08-07T04:05:22Z 20146 TID-15ja78 ERROR: heartbeat: Connection timed out\n2014-08-07T04:05:27Z 20146 TID-157z6g ERROR: Connection timed out\n2014-08-07T04:05:27Z 20146 TID-157z6g ERROR: /home/ubuntu/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2@w2v/gems/redis-3.0.7/lib/redis/client.rb:222:in `rescue in io'\n...repeated cycles of previous block here...\n2014-08-07T04:07:06Z 20146 TID-157nm2 INFO: Redis is online, 104.96476221084595 sec downtime\n```\n\nJust wondering if this Web UI behaviour may be resolved in the future or if it's intentional or unavoidable. Restarting the worker is my present solution.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1884/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
