Now it raises:\n\n**Before (v4.1.1):**\n\n``` ruby\nclass MyJob\n  include Sidekiq::Worker\n\n  def perform\n  end\nend\n\n2.3.1 :008 > Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk('class' => MyJob, 'args' => [])\n => []\n```\n\n**After (v4.1.2):**\n\n``` ruby\nclass MyJob\n  include Sidekiq::Worker\n\n  def perform\n  end\nend\n\n2.3.1 :008 > Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk('class' => MyJob, 'args' => [])\nArgumentError: Bulk arguments must be an Array of Arrays: [[1], [2]]\n```\n\n2) Also, this now only validates the first argument:\n\n**Before (v4.1.1):**\n\n``` ruby\n2.3.1 :008 > Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk('class' => MyJob, 'args' => [[], 'not-an-array'])\nArgumentError: Bulk arguments must be an Array of Arrays: [[1], [2]]\n```\n\n**After (v4.1.2):**\n\n``` ruby\n2.3.1 :008 > Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk('class' => MyJob, 'args' => [[], 'not-an-array'])\n => [\"27679d5395ecf1bacd3112dc\", \"aaa650e00c64dfcf9b85db5e\"] \n```\n\n---\n\nFWIW, my use-case for the first one is something like:\n\n``` ruby\ndef enqueue_jobs\n  Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk(\n    'class' => MyJob,\n    'args' => some_method_that_returns_an_array\n  )\nend\n```\n\nI could refactor it to something like this, but I feel the former is cleaner and more ruby-esque (e.g. `[].each` is just a no-op, it doesn't raise):\n\n``` ruby\ndef enqueue_jobs\n  array = some_method_that_returns_an_array\n  return if array.empty?\n\n  Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk(\n    'class' => MyJob,\n    'args' => array\n  )\nend\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
