Using a bucket limiter in a worker with Sidekiq testing inline mode and something like Timecop which freezes time causes an infinite loop. A worker like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyWorker\r\n  include Sidekiq::Worker\r\n  def perform\r\n    Sidekiq::Limiter.bucket(\"DripDrip\", 1, :second, wait_timeout: 0).within_limit do\r\n      # ...\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a spec like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRSpec.describe MyWorker do\r\n  specify do\r\n    Sidekiq::Testing.inline! do\r\n      Timecop.freeze do\r\n        MyWorker.perform\r\n        MyWorker.perform\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\ncauses an infinite loop, and outputs log entries like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBucket rate limit DripDrip exceeded, pausing...\r\nBucket rate limit DripDrip exceeded, pausing...\r\nBucket rate limit DripDrip exceeded, pausing...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like the limiter is waiting, or pausing, even when wait time is zero?\r\n\r\nIt also seems like maybe the limiters are using wall time to calculate elapsed time, maybe [monotonic time](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2018/03/elapsed-time-with-ruby-the-right-way/) might be better?","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4000/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4000/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
