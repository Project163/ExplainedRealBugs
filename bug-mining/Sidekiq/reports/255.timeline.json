a lot for Sidekiq!\r\n\r\nIn our setup with a Redis cluster, we are having regular failovers,\r\nwhich is fine. We are currently improving the way our application\r\nhandles these situations and stumbled across a possible improvement\r\nin Sidekiq itself.\r\n\r\nBy far the most frequent error in our error monitoring system is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    UNBLOCKED force unblock from blocking operation, instance state changed (master -> replica?)\r\n\r\nThese errors can occur during Sidekiq's long-running job fetching\r\ncommand. This uses Redis' blocking BRPOP primitive. On failover in a\r\ncluster setup, these commands are interrupted by the server.\r\n\r\nThis error causes the worker threads to be restarted, but as they are\r\nbubbled up to the top, they cause a lot of spam in our error logging\r\nsystems. As related errors from other commands are being handled (see\r\n#2550 and #4495) this way, it seems senbile to also handle this one.\r\n\r\n####
