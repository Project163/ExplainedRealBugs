We have Sidekiq jobs which themselves call `perform_async` and found that the parent job lost their current attributes after performing the child job.\r\n\r\nIt's easiest to demonstrate this with a test against `perform_inline` directly though:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# test/current_attributes_test.rb\r\n\r\nclass CurrentAttributesJob\r\n  include Sidekiq::Job\r\n\r\n  def perform; end\r\nend\r\n\r\ndescribe \"Current attributes\" do\r\n  before do\r\n    @config = reset!\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  it \"persists after perform_inline\" do\r\n    Sidekiq::CurrentAttributes.persist(Myapp::Current, @config)\r\n    Myapp::Current.user_id = 1\r\n    assert_equal 1, Myapp::Current.user_id\r\n    CurrentAttributesJob.perform_inline\r\n    assert_equal 1, Myapp::Current.user_id # got nil\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is `Sidekiq::CurrentAttributes::Load#call` resets all the attributes afterwards. \r\n\r\nWe think that instead it should call `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes.set` on each class, i.e.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nMyapp::Current.set(user_id: 123) do\r\n  Myapp::OtherCurrent.set(other_id: \"abc\") do\r\n    yield\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne way of doing that:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    def call(_, job, _, &block)\r\n      klass_attrs = {}\r\n\r\n      @cattrs.each do |(key, strklass)|\r\n        next unless job.has_key?(key)\r\n\r\n        klass_attrs[strklass.constantize] = job[key]\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      klass_attrs.inject(block) { |chain, (klass, attrs)|\r\n        -> { klass.set(attrs, &chain) }\r\n      }.call\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr with recursion, easier to follow:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    def call(_, job, _, &block)\r\n      klass_attrs = {}\r\n\r\n      @cattrs.each do |(key, strklass)|\r\n        next unless job.has_key?(key)\r\n\r\n        klass_attrs[strklass.constantize] = job[key]\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      wrap(klass_attrs.to_a, &block)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def wrap(klass_attrs, &block)\r\n      klass, attrs = klass_attrs.shift\r\n      return block.call unless klass\r\n\r\n      klass.set(attrs) do\r\n        wrap(klass_attrs, &block)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
