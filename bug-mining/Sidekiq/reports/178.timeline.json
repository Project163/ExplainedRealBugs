All the work of preparing the mailer object happens in Sidekiq and does not slow down web response time. \nIn contrast `UserMailer.welcome(user.id).deliver_later` is going to execute the `welcome` method immediately and send to Sidekiq the prepared mailer object.\n\nIt is true that the the mailer methods are not expected to do something complicated, but it is also true that we don't need them executed in the web request when they can be executed later, that was something I really love about Sidekiq and never tried to migrate to `ActiveJob`.\n\nIs there no way to keep the current delayed extension behaviour?
