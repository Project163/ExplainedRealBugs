The restart happens right after a job's execution if memory usage exceeds the threshold. \nMeanwhile, metrics flushing happens on every `:beat` event. \nSo if a job finishes and the process restarts between beats, the metrics for that job aren't collected. \n\nSample code for reproducing without sidekiq-ent:\n```ruby\nclass SomeJob\n  include Sidekiq::Job\n\n  def perform\n    puts \"job performed\"\n    Process.kill(:TERM, Process.pid)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI'm wondering if it's ok to:\n* flush metrics on `:shutdown` event as well\n* or, fire a `:beat` event during shutdown procedure\n\nI'd be happy to open a pull request for this! \n\nLooking forward to your thoughts 🙏 ","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6764/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
