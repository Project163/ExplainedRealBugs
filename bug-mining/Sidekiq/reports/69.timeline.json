controller\nSidekiq.redis do |conn|\n          workers = conn.smembers('workers')\n          conn.srem('workers', workers) if !workers.empty?\nend\n\nand when clicking \"clear workers list\" from the sidekiq webui. \n\nDue to this I am unable to stop any busy workers from rails and instead have to stop the sidekiq server. Any suggestions for an alternative way of shutting down busy workers during the meantime?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
