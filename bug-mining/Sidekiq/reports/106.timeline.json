had some questions that the wiki doesn't seem to answer, although I can guess exactly what would happen. I thought I'd open an issue here, get some solid answers, and then incorporate that into the wiki.\n\nQuestions are for Sidekiq Pro 2.0+.\n\nA couple of these are related to the 30-day expiration limit, which isn't in the wiki, but is at least [mentioned in the Pro 2.0 upgrade notes](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/19ef4722e19c29bd14ee714045fabdcaf10ed6f9/Pro-2.0-Upgrade.md#batch-data).\n## Batches with a job that is killed or deleted\n\nSay a batch has 5 jobs and 1 of those jobs fails. Someone goes into the Web UI and deletes the job because the work no longer needs to happen. (Ideally, the job would just know when it can `return` early, but that isn't always the case.)\n\nWhat happens to the batch? Will the success callback ever fire?\n\nDoes the outcome depend on a job being killed vs deleted?\n\nBased on what I've seen, it looks like, the batch information remains in Redis until the 30-day expiration limit, and the success callback will never automatically fires, when a job is killed _or_ deleted. Is there a supported way (API?) to take a batch ID (through the web UI) and force it to trigger its success callback and remove itself from Redis?\n## Callback retries\n\nIf a batch callback itself errors, does it retry? Based on https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/1744 I believe the answer is yes, although it isn't in the wiki.\n## Batch expiration with a failing job\n\nIf a job for a particular batch doesn’t succeed for over 30 days, what happens?\n\nDoes the batch data expire from Redis? Does the job itself remain longer than 30 days, continuing to fail? Is it entirely on developers/whoever, to recognise that a job that failed until day 31+ may be part of a batch that no longer exists?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
