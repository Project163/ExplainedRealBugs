this PR does / why we need it**:\r\n\r\nDisable setting Redis client ID by Sidekiq, as this is not supported by some cloud providers, e.g. GCP.\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** \r\n\r\nhttps://issues.redhat.com/browse/THREESCALE-9210\r\n\r\n**Verification steps** \r\n\r\n- start Rails server and Sidekiq\r\n- open the Redis CLI (for the Sidekiq redis)\r\n- run `client list` command\r\n- verify that there are no entries with names like `name=Sidekiq-client-PID-12345` `name=Sidekiq-server-PID-12345`\r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer**:\r\n\r\nSetting the client ID is a feature in Sidekiq gem v5, the possibility to disable it was added [here](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/33846c849a947b1bf9800c22738dadbb953cc49a), see also [this comment](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/3521#issuecomment-310056217).\r\n\r\nThis was deleted in the future versions, see [the commit](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/05f874edea405a9f7a28bc5d63f0d04b0d3fa4b3) and the [release note](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/main/Changes.md#607) (_\"Remove Redis connection naming [#4479]\"_).\r\nHowever, porta is using `gem 'sidekiq', '< 6'`, so the `:id` is still set by default, unless `id: nil` is forced.\r\n\r\nBoth 5.x and higher versions allow setting an explicit client ID if needed. In this PR though we are not adding this functionality - this has never been requested, and is hardly used by anyone. Once we upgrade, the `config.id = nil` can be deleted, and the behavior will be the same (no ID set).\r\n\r\nThen, in future, if somebody requests explicit client identifier, it can be added.\r\n\r\n**Release notes**\r\n\r\nThis \"feature\" (setting Redis client identifier for Sidekiq) has never been announced or documented, so this can hardly be considered a breaking change, but as it does add a possibility to use 3scale with Redis that has `CLIENT` command disabled, we can add a release note.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n> Setting Redis connection identifier was disabled for Sidekiq Redis, which allows using Redis instances where CLIENT command is restricted. Previously, the connection name was set to `Sidekiq-client-PID-{PID}` or `Sidekiq-server-PID-{PID}`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/3scale/porta/issues/3197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/3scale/porta/issues/3197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13766717704,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADDA9M4OJ2uazwAAAAM0j3EI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/13766717704","actor":{"login":"AlexSc","id":98665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexSc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"33846c849a947b1bf9800c22738dadbb953cc49a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GoCarrot/sidekiq/commits/33846c849a947b1bf9800c22738dadbb953cc49a","created_at":"2024-08-05T16:13:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
