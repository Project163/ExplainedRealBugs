When we attempt to delete a retry from the Sidekiq UI, we get `uninitialized constant Sidekiq::Rack::Request`. The issue appears to stem from adding \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'sidekiq/rack/batch_status'\r\nuse Sidekiq::Rack::BatchStatus\r\n```\r\n\r\nto `config.ru` according to the configuration instructions in `lib/sidekiq/rack/batch_status.rb` in sidekiq-pro. It appears the latest changes aren't compatible with using `Sidekiq::Rack::BatchStatus`. I think simply scoping references to Rack to the top level will fix this incompatibility (https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/web/csrf_protection.rb#L75 and https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/web/csrf_protection.rb#L141)","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4655/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
