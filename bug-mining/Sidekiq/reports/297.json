There are a few preconditions to trigger this.\r\n1. I'm using Devise for authentication\r\n2. Sidekiq UI is guarded by devise, eg:\r\n```ruby\r\nauthenticate :user, ->(u) { u.admin? } do\r\n  mount Sidekiq::Web => '/sidekiq'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n3. `Current` is set in a warden callback, eg:\r\n```ruby\r\nWarden::Manager.prepend_after_set_user do |user, auth, opts|\r\n  Current.user_id = user.id\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat leads to the `cattr`-hash being overwritten with the user id of my admin user when clicking \"Retry\" in the admin interface. The reason for this is c92a521, which fixed #5090. Both issues could be solved by doing nothing if a `cattr`-hash already exists, eg. just guarding with `unless job.key?(\"cattr\")`.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a different story why you decided to merge the hashes instead, but this lead to some quite surprising results on our end.","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
