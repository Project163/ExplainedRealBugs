When using the `parallel_tests` gem to run a test suite with multiple processes, tests running in different processes will use the same test mode als a test that for instance disables Sidekiq testing mode.\r\n\r\nIn our test setup we added this monkey patch to keep the test mode from leaking to other test processes:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Make sidekiq test modes threadsafe\r\nmodule Sidekiq\r\n  module MultiThreadedOverrides\r\n    def __test_mode\r\n      Thread.current[:__sidekiq_test_mode]\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def __test_mode=(mode)\r\n      Thread.current[:__sidekiq_test_mode] = mode\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def __set_test_mode(mode)\r\n      if block_given?\r\n        current_mode = __test_mode\r\n        begin\r\n          __test_mode = mode\r\n          yield\r\n        ensure\r\n          __test_mode = current_mode\r\n        end\r\n      else\r\n        __test_mode = mode\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  class Testing\r\n    prepend MultiThreadedOverrides\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to fix this issue directly in the Sidekiq gem?
