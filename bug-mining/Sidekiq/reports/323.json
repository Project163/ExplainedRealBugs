I also want to use a different database than the default (0).\r\nI realized that Sidekiq ignores the database if i try to set it with the url option. In fact, it seems to ignore the complete url option (https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/30786e082c70349ab27ffa9eccc42fb0c696164d/lib/sidekiq/redis_client_adapter.rb#L99).\r\n\r\nIn the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/docs/7.0-API-Migration.md#redis-sentinels) there's a link to the redis-client documentation which states that it's possible to set the db with the url.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```yaml\r\n# doesn't work:\r\nsidekiq:\r\n  url: \"redis://mymain/12\"\r\n  password: ..\r\n  name: mymain\r\n  sentinels:\r\n    - host: ..  \r\n      port: ..\r\n      password: ..\r\n    - host: ..\r\n      port: ..\r\n      password: ..\r\n    - host: ..\r\n      port: ..\r\n      password: ..\r\n  role: master\r\n\r\n# works\r\nsidekiq:\r\n  db: 12\r\n  password: ..\r\n  name: mymain\r\n  sentinels:\r\n    - host: ..  \r\n      port: ..\r\n      password: ..\r\n    - host: ..\r\n      port: ..\r\n      password: ..\r\n    - host: ..\r\n      port: ..\r\n      password: ..\r\n  role: master\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf my assumption is correct: is there a reason why Sidekiq ignores the option? It'd be very good to include this in the documentation then.
