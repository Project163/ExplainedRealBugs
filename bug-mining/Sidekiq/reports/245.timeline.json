trying to turn off New Relic for Sidekiq::Web using this:\r\nhttps://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/ignoring-specific-transactions#page-load-timing-rum\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, to get running I've created a monkey patch that deletes the Content-Type header from responses coming from Sidekiq::Web. Hope this helps someone:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'sidekiq/web'\r\n\r\nmodule RemoveContentLengthHeader\r\n  def call(env)\r\n    resp = super\r\n    resp[1].delete('Content-Length')\r\n    resp\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nSidekiq::WebApplication.prepend(RemoveContentLengthHeader)\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/580005640/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pelargir","id":3756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir","html_url":"https://github.com/pelargir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pelargir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/580012810","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4440#issuecomment-580012810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4440","id":580012810,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDAxMjgxMA==","user":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-29T23:31:15Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T23:31:15Z","body":"If it works without NewRelic, please open an issue with them too.
