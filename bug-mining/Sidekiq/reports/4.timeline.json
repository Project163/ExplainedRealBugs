In CLI, we add all of the queues to options[:queues], duplicating the items based on the weights. So if someone configures the server with -q foo,5 and -q bar,2 we would have ['foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'foo', 'bar', 'bar']. After that we shuffle the array via Array#shuffle!. I'm wondering if you can still get the weighted randomization effect in Manager#dispatch by simply grabbing a random element from @queues instead of iterating/indexing and (perhaps redundantly checking?) each queue in @queues for work. Essentially Manager#dispatch would do something like this:\n\n``` ruby\n  def dispatch(schedule)\n    loop do\n      found = false\n      @ready.size.times do\n        found ||= find_work(@queues.sample)\n      end\n      break unless found\n    end\n    after(1) { verbose('ping'); dispatch(schedule) } if schedule\n  end\n```\n\nSo you are essentially asking each ready/available processor to handle work from a randomly selected queue from the weighted @queues array. Manager#find_work would just take the queue instead of the index. This way if the @queues happens to be large based on someone setting high weights, you are only iterating over the number of processors, not the length of @queues. This also results in less calls to redis.\n\nThoughts?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/3919131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ryanlecompte","id":637158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/637158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanlecompte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanlecompte/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/3919143","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/13#issuecomment-3919143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/13","id":3919143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTkxNDM=","user":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-02-11T07:01:37Z","updated_at":"2012-02-11T07:01:37Z","body":"I
