However, if the size of that array doesn't match the number of jobs, this will throw a redis error:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    # test/test_client.rb\r\n    it 'cannot handle at with different size' do\r\n      at = Time.new(2020, 1, 1).to_f\r\n      first_jid, second_jid = Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk('class' => QueuedWorker, 'args' => [[1], [2]], 'at' => [at]) # will raise +Redis::CommandError: ERR value is not a valid float+\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to fix this one, but there are many way to do so... Here are the solutions I had in mind:\r\n\r\n1. raise properly an `ArgumentError` if size mismatch\r\n2. use the last `at` item as default when at is smaller:\r\n   ```ruby\r\n   Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk('class' => K, 'args' => [[1], [2]], 'at' => [at])\r\n   # would be like\r\n   Sidekiq::Client.push_bulk('class' => K, 'args' => [[1], [2]], 'at' => [at, at])\r\n   ```","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
