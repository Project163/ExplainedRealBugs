For example we process jobs based on different \"environments\" ie `test`, `sandbox`, or `production`. We average about 3 different tags per job to single priorities and risks.\n```\n<span class=\"label label-info jobtag\">test</span>\n```\n\nI'd like the ability to define custom colors for these tags so that at a glance it's easy to parse my different jobs into buckets. Something like.\n```\n<span class=\"label label-info jobtag jobtag-test\">test</span>\n```\n\nGenerally this type of thing can help with dyslexic accessibility.
