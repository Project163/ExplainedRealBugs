Description\r\n\r\nThere’s a CVE for actionpack in Pender that should be resolved by us upgrading Rails to 6.1.74 (or just doing ~>6.1.7 and upgrading)\r\n\r\nReferences: cv2-3384\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n\r\nRan a request to `pender`, like the one below, got the parsed response 🎉 \r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET -H 'X-Pender-Token: dev' -H 'Content-type: application/json'

broke:\r\n\r\n- Sidekiq: it was initially bumped to 7, but since that one doesn't support `delayed extensions` anymore, I kept it under that. However, we use that in one place, it doesn't look like it will be super hard to upgrade(🤞). Seems to be setup [here (03_sidekiq.rb#L27)](https://github.com/meedan/pender/blob/3384-update-rails-to-6.1.7.4/config/initializers/03_sidekiq.rb#L27) and used [here(media_archive_org_archiver.rb#L28)](https://github.com/meedan/pender/blob/3384-update-rails-to-6.1.7.4/app/models/concerns/media_archive_org_archiver.rb#L28).\r\n- Addressable/Postrank: kept addressable at 2.8.1, after that version there is an issue with Postrank, and we are not able to run `uri.normalize`\r\n\r\n**relevant links / sidekiq's upgrade**\r\n-
