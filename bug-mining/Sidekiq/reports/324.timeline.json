of allowing every src, require scripts from unknown sources to have have a nonce. This makes it harder to exploit potential XSS vulnverabilities as the attacker needs to somehow know the nonce beforehand.\r\n\r\nThis also adds the nonce to all internal scripts. As per https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/pull/3913#issuecomment-410318634 the assets may be hosted outside of the main app. Adding the nonce continues to support this usecase.\r\n\r\nA nonce is incompatible with `unsafe-inline` (which only style has). Adapt the chart to not assign inline styles directly.\r\n\r\nExtensions that load external scripts/styles must either vendor or add the nonce to their tags.\r\n\r\nCloses #6268\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUsing nonces is the least disruptive change I believe. However, extensions that load resources from external sources (like from a CDN) will have the browser refuse to load them.\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n# Previous\r\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" integrity=\"sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\r\n\r\n# Newly required\r\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" integrity=\"sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" nonce=\"<%= csp_nonce %>\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, because nonces are incompatible with `unsafe-inline`, things like `<span style=\"background-color: red;\"></span>` won't work anymore. You can look at the chart changes what this actually means since sidekiq itself requires a small change for this. It is very similar in scope to the changes about removing `unsafe-inline` from `script-src` which you did in the past.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12639778675,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADDA9M6HHxwczwAAAALxY7dz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/12639778675","actor":{"login":"Earlopain","id":14981592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain","html_url":"https://github.com/Earlopain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0fabdfc2ab004d573455b4cbdb5893a5aa1281c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Earlopain/sidekiq/commits/0fabdfc2ab004d573455b4cbdb5893a5aa1281c4","created_at":"2024-04-29T09:01:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12646108177,"node_id":"CE_lADOADDA9M6HHxwczwAAAALxxEwR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/12646108177","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-29T16:46:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12746201585,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADDA9M6HHxwczwAAAAL3u5nx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/12746201585","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"be6a3a930473a4991eb393538d38c7b9ec1b02e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/commits/be6a3a930473a4991eb393538d38c7b9ec1b02e6","created_at":"2024-05-08T16:03:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
