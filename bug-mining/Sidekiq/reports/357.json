However, there are edge cases where this can present a problem.\n\nRecently, we started routing Sidekiq redis traffic through an Envoy TCP proxy. By default, Envoy has a 1-hour idle timeout for its TCP proxy connections. No other layer of our infrastructure implements this timeout mechanism, and so this is net-new.\n\nWhen we began routing this traffic through Envoy, we started seeing high numbers of SSL and broken pipe errors, depending on which redis clients we were using - for older implementations (e.g. 4.5.x), we see `SSL_read: unexpected eof` errors; for newer implementations (e.g. 5.4.x), we see `broken pipe`. In either case, these appear to be caused by the idle connection timeouts in Envoy.\n\nAlso, in either case, these cause job failures.\n\nUltimately, the problem appears to be caused by Envoy closing a connection, followed by Sidekiq - via redis-client - attempting to access the now-closed socket. Envoy recommends not disabling idle timeouts, as this can lead to leaky connections and cause performance degradation.\n\n`connection_pool` allows creation of a reaper thread. While I believe it is technically possible to manage Sidekiq's pool out of band, this generally seems like a bad idea for a pool which is intended to be internal to Sidekiq.\n\nWould adding reaper support be feasible? Or do you recommend simply running an out-of-band reaper thread within application code? And if the latter, could documentation be updated to make this explicit?","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
