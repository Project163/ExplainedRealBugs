During our upgrade we first paused all queues. After all the nodes were on Sidekiq 8, we started unpausing queues. I accidentally deleted one of our queues while trying to unpause it. I was using the live poll feature and it refreshed the page at the exact same moment I was trying to unpause the queue. That caused a slight layout shift and the delete button was suddenly underneath my cursor. It was so fast that I didn't notice and clicked it. This would have been fine if the usual confirmation dialog popped up. But it didn't. The queue was immediately deleted. The confirmation dialog does seem to pop up when the page is not being actively refreshed by the live poll feature.\n\nLuckily the deleted queue wasn't critical. This could have been much worse.","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6768/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
