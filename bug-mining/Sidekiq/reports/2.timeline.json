GitLab, I'm seeing Sidekiq v4.0.1 get stuck periodically and stop processing jobs or responding at all. \nI've never seen this kind of issue with any other GitLab instance, but on this particular one this happens about every day, and I'm at a loss.\n\n`ps aux | grep sidekiq` shows:\n\n```\ngit      36646 20.0 10.6 2827564 1294940 ?     Tsl  14:17   2:33 sidekiq 4.0.1 gitlab-rails [25 of 25 busy]                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n```\n\nThe Processes list in Sidekiq Web is empty, the Busy counter reads 0, and the Jobs list is empty.\n\nNothing shows up in the Sidekiq log for `kill -TTIN 36646`\n\nGDB output per [the Troubleshooting doc](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Problems-and-Troubleshooting#frozen-processes): https://gist.github.com/DouweM/0f15e8f841a7d5643255\n\n`(gdb) call (void)rb_backtrace()` output from the log: https://gist.github.com/DouweM/36a8e0bfbb230d876062 \nThe last frame is incorrectly ascribed to `gitlab_git`, in reality it's [`Rugged::Diff#each_patch`](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged/blob/master/ext%2Frugged%2Frugged_diff.c#L460).\n\nAny idea what could be going on?\n\nThanks a lot!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T13:53:11Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T13:53:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4352","id":513917332,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTM5MTczMzI=","number":4352,"title":"Frozen
