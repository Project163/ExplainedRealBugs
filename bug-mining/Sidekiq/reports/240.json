The test suite does not have a test to ensure this value stays the same type so I'm not sure if this change was intentional or an unintended side effect of the optimization in commit 60361b0. I am now handling both cases in my API usage but a decision should be made on the type of the payload key and a test added to ensure it stays the same. If `String` is chosen, the documentation should be updated to mention this breaking change.","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4387/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
