2.5.2, Sidekiq 5.2.2, Pro 4.0.4, Ent 1.7.1.\r\n\r\nWe love sidekiq enterprise limiters, and use them quite a bit. <3 We hit an obscure issue at the intersection of limiters, inline mode, and frozen time. Using a bucket limiter in a worker with Sidekiq testing inline mode and something like Timecop which freezes time causes an infinite loop. A worker like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyWorker\r\n  include Sidekiq::Worker\r\n  def perform\r\n    Sidekiq::Limiter.bucket(\"DripDrip\", 1, :second, wait_timeout: 0).within_limit do\r\n      # ...\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a spec like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRSpec.describe MyWorker do\r\n  specify do\r\n    Sidekiq::Testing.inline! do\r\n      Timecop.freeze do\r\n        MyWorker.perform\r\n        MyWorker.perform\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\ncauses an infinite loop, and outputs log entries like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBucket rate limit DripDrip exceeded, pausing...\r\nBucket rate limit DripDrip exceeded, pausing...\r\nBucket rate limit DripDrip exceeded, pausing...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like the limiter is waiting, or pausing, even when wait time is zero?\r\n\r\nIt also seems like maybe the limiters are using wall time to calculate elapsed time, maybe [monotonic time](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2018/03/elapsed-time-with-ruby-the-right-way/) might be better?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4000/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4000/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13766718387,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADDA9M4WJ8ExzwAAAAM0j3Oz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/13766718387","actor":{"login":"AlexSc","id":98665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexSc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexSc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aa9745e9b29d408ac423356af50859cb9c382135","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GoCarrot/sidekiq/commits/aa9745e9b29d408ac423356af50859cb9c382135","created_at":"2024-08-05T16:13:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
