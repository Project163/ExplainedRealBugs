A quick informal Twitter survey shows that a good, healthy Redis service in AWS will exhibit RTT < 1000µs. A cheapie, free service shows latency between 5-20ms. Warn if RTT goes over 50ms.\r\n\r\nFor now I don't have a good plan to expose this data in the Web UI but it is available in the API:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSidekiq::ProcessSet.new.each { |sp| puts sp[\"rtt_us\"] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n          Your Redis network connection is performing extremely poorly.\r\n          Current RTT is #{rtt}µs, ideally this should be < 1000.\r\n          Ensure Redis is running in the same AZ or datacenter as Sidekiq.\r\n```\r\n\r\n![jeffstoneblake_2021-Feb-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2911/108784241-d0a96680-7523-11eb-9df4-568545549be4.jpg)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4824/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":9,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
