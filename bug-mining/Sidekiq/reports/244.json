There is [no variable or method named `e`](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/processor.rb#L184) in this rescue branch.\r\n\r\n2. There [doesn't appear to be a constant](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/logger.rb#L86) called `UNKNOWN` defined in this scope.\r\n\r\n3.  [Here](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/api.rb#L462) `@parent.delete_by_value(...)` is called. `@parent` may be an instance of the class `SortedSet` (see [here](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/api.rb#L558) and [here](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/api.rb#L453)). However, the `SortedSet` class has no instance method `delete_by_value`. This may not be an issue if the SortedSet#scan method is only called on instances of JobSet (a subclass of SortedSet which does define `delete_by_value`), but based on the code this may not always be the case and there are no checks to ensure it.\r\n\r\n4. [Here](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/testing.rb#L260) and [here](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/worker.rb#L237) the `get_sidekiq_options` method is called from inside the `Sidekiq::Worker::ClassMethods` module, but this method is actually defined in `Sidekiq::Worker::Options::ClassMethods`. This may not be an issue depending on how modules are meant to be composed/included.","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4429/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
