href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement. If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement. If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement. If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement. If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement.

Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n<h2>6.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn if Redis is configured to evict data under memory pressure <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4752\">#4752</a></li>\n<li>Add process RSS on the Busy page <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4717\">#4717</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6.1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve readability in dark mode Web UI <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4674\">#4674</a></li>\n<li>Fix Web UI crash with corrupt session <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4672\">#4672</a></li>\n<li>Allow middleware to yield arguments [#4673, <a href=\"https://github.com/eugeneius\"><code>@​eugeneius</code></a>]</li>\n<li>Migrate CI from CircleCI to GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4677\">#4677</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Jobs are now sorted by age in the Busy Workers table. <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4641\">#4641</a></li>\n<li>Fix &quot;check all&quot; JS logic in Web UI <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4619\">#4619</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.0...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.0&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement. If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n<h2>6.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn if Redis is configured to evict data under memory pressure <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4752\">#4752</a></li>\n<li>Add process RSS on the Busy page <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4717\">#4717</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.2...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.2&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement. If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.3...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.3&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
