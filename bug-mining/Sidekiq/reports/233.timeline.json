get that... been a sidekiq user for many years, and a pro user for 4+.  Internal apis can chance at any time... but it is worth noting that Sidekiq is so pervasive that many other libraries have \"connected\" to to it, and a common use case is changing the logger for a more rich logger, as long as it meets the same API as the standard Ruby or Rails loggers.  This version adds a method that will break any other logger, I think.

Sidekiq allows extending `JobLogger` with the custom context, but it would be nice to have this ability at basic level. What do you think if we expose context API (`with_context` or `ctx`) in the next major version opening customization at basic `Sidekiq::Logger` level and forcing all 3rd-party loggers to conform it? I understand it's another one breaking change, but it could establish a more specific contract for other loggers. I guess extra research is required to understand the commonalities between popular 3rd-party loggers for Sidekiq to make the right decision.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/527792946/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Tensho","id":892721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/892721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho","html_url":"https://github.com/Tensho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2606086214,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYwNjA4NjIxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/2606086214","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-04T08:10:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2606086215,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MDYwODYyMTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/2606086215","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-04T08:10:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/528801658","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4239#issuecomment-528801658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4239","id":528801658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODgwMTY1OA==","user":{"login":"kranzky","id":38485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky","html_url":"https://github.com/kranzky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T10:25:32Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T10:25:32Z","body":"@MisterFine1
