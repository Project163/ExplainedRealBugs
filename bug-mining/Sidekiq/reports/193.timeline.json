What is the use case for the Web UI running against an unsupported configuration fo Redis? Is there a way to run Sidekiq against a sharded Redis cluster? \r\n\r\n2. Have you considered the (my) use case for running Sidekiq against a multi-master Redis for the purpose of migrating environments? It is difficult to migrate a heavily utilized Sidekiq cluster (replete with scheduled sets) from one cloud provider to another without a significant amount of downtime. Multi-master replication would also enable multi-regional implementations without having to build some kind of tenancy model.
