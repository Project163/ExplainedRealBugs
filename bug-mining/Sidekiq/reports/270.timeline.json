I believe switching to strict priority fixes it, so that's an option:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    queues:\r\n        - queue_one_delivery\r\n        - default\r\n        - queue_two_delivery\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the issue is a thread race condition in the way the weighted queues are scrambled on each fetch. I suspect the bug only happens on jruby because of its true parallelism.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/948890431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5500477243,"node_id":"CE_lADOADDA9M49cN3VzwAAAAFH2p87","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/5500477243","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"bd3f2009ec4f7d1cc6a0af467178bc8fe1439b1c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/commits/bd3f2009ec4f7d1cc6a0af467178bc8fe1439b1c","created_at":"2021-10-21T18:39:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/948900364","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5031#issuecomment-948900364","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5031","id":948900364,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADDA9M44jxIM","user":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T18:39:45Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T18:39:45Z","body":"Can
