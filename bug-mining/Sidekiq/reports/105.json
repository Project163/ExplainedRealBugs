It would be a lot more useful to me to see the process named according to the contents of `ENV['DYNO']`, e.g. `worker.1`, `media_worker.5` etc. \n\nFrom my rudimentary investigate it looks like this has to be pushed from the process into the `ProcessSet` in Redis in order for the Busy view to show it, which it does by:\n\n`<td><%= \"#{process['hostname']}:#{process['pid']}\" %></td>`\n\nSo either I mangle hostname and pid inside `Process` which doesn't seem like a sensible idea, or we add another cli option, maybe `--name $DYNO` to specify a custom process name. Then the Busy view is changed to something like:\n\n`<td><%= \"#{process.name}\" %></td>`\n\nwhere `Process#name` is:\n\n```\ndef name\n  @name ||= self['name'] || identity\nend\n```\n\nDoes this sound ok? Or is there a another approach you'd prefer?\n","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
