There may be cases where this happens (nothing from me, maybe a 3rd party Sidekiq plugin?) but it should be rare. The happy path has people using Sidekiq::Web on their own site, with no 3rd party bits or links involved. Nevertheless, that's why Sidekiq::Web has CSRF protection, just in case.\n\nBut browser vendors (e.g. Chrome, Edge) are rolling out cookies with SameSite=Lax as the default. Since Sidekiq::Web encodes all destructive actions as POSTs, it should be safe to remove CSRF protection from Sidekiq::Web as long as Lax is the default. Safari goes further and blocks all 3rd party cookies by default. Firefox is the only holdout that I can see.\n\nThoughts or feedback?\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Add a flag for Sidekiq 8.x which allows the user to disable CSRF protection.\n- Remove CSRF completely from Sidekiq 9.0.\n- Add `SameSite=Strict` to any code examples using Rack::Session::Cookie.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://vickieli.dev/csrf/csrf-updates/\nhttps://www.heatware.net/tech-tips/what-are-samesite-cookies/","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
