This is so that I can set a low visibility timeout which means the messages will become visible much quicker for reprocessing.\n\nThe use of `defer` means that the worker is executing in a second thread and so `Shoryuken::Shutdown` was being sent to its parent instead.\n\nAs an aside, using less threads will likely be better for performance too.\n\nThe only downside I can imagine for this is that any custom middleware with a blanket `rescue` will start catching these previously uncatchable errors.
