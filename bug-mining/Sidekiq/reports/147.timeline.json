is somewhat of a followup to #2531. I finally tracked down the other reason why we're losing jobs. \n\nCurrently, ReliableFetch assumes the old process will die before the new process starts up. We use [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) which does not guarantee this. This is causing us to \"miss\" scheduled messages on restart or code deployments. Here's a simplified view of what's happening in cases where the old worker stays up longer:\n1. v1 of the worker pulls m1 into it's private queue and works on it\n2. v2 of the worker starts up, reads all the messages (m1) in the private queue and starts working on them\n3. v1 of the worker completes m1, pulls m2 into the private queue and is terminated before completing it\n\nAt this point, m2 is \"lost\" until the next restart which may not happen for hours or days. This is particularly bad for time sensitive jobs. \n\nI'm not sure there's an easy fix for this, would be nice if the [reliable fetch redesign](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/2600) took this into account.\n\n(Sidekiq 3.5.0, sidekiq-pro 2.0.8)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/2625/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1001283439,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwMDEyODM0Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/1001283439","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3b5862492a6f8ff114cc11ec751f311b0f49483f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/commits/3b5862492a6f8ff114cc11ec751f311b0f49483f","created_at":"2017-03-15T17:03:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
