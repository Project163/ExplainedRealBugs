If there is a reason, using some of the new features that aren't available in Redis 7.1, then this issue can be closed. However, if there isn't a reason, might I suggest lowering the requirement to at least Redis 7.1.\n\nRedis 7.1 is the last version that is available in ElastiCache on AWS. They've switched over to Valkey for 7.2 compatibility forward. This normally wouldn't be an issue, but it appears that AWS does not have a nice transition path from Redis 7.1 to Valkey 7.2.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35ebfc54-e1cb-48f2-946a-644a0c6e5f36)\n\nEven though the upgrade path appears to be available, it constantly errors out and I'm assuming that it's directing me to create a new and separate Valkey 7.2 environment and then to use that instead of the older Redis one. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d76fe4e-b5ea-4ce6-9715-9ed61bfc8242)\n\nThat may not be a big deal for a smaller application with no scheduled jobs, but could be problematic for others.","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6630/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6630/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
