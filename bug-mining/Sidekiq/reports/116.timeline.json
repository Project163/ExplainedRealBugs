seen a few interesting issues as of late with the Busy tab in the web console. There are two flavors of a similar problem that we've experienced:\n1. The Busy count at the top of the screen reads one number, but clicking on the tab and viewing the Busy list reveals a greater number of busy jobs than is in the total. (For instance, right now our Busy tab total is 3. Clicking on the tab and summing the total of the Busy column from the Processes table also yields 3, but below that there are 6 jobs listed in the Jobs table. None of those 6 jobs are duplicates of each other, and none of their JIDs have shown up as \"done\" in our logs.)\n2. Sometimes, the behavior appears as above except that some of the JIDs in the Jobs table actually show up as having finished in our logs, indicating that the overall Busy total is correct and the Jobs table is incorrect. This occurred yesterday but isn't happening now so I'm not sure how much detail I can provide until we see it again.\n\nThese two issues are independent of the refresh rate of the Busy count total. Refreshing the page produces no change.\n\nFor what it's worth, these problems may have been happening previously, but we started noticing them a few days ago when we bumped our version of the Sidekiq gem and started using reliable fetch and reliable push.\n\nWe're using:\nsidekiq 3.1.4\nsidekiq-pro 1.7.4\nreliable fetch\nreliable push\nHeroku\n\nLet me know if there's any further digging around this I can do!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-08T04:06:06Z","updated_at":"2014-08-08T04:06:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1871","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1871/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1871/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1871/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1871","id":39021152,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTAyMTE1Mg==","number":1871,"title":"disappear
