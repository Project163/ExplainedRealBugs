version: 3.2.2\r\nRails version: 7.0.8\r\nSidekiq / Pro / Enterprise version(s): 7.1.6\r\n\r\n[This

this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSidekiq::Testing.inline! do\r\n  Job1.perform_async # mode is inline\r\n\r\n  Job2.perform_async # mode is now fake (it's nil, and fake is default)\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Job1\r\n

Sidekiq::Testing.fake! { reschedule_in_the_future } : reschedule_in_the_future\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's (simplified) what we use to avoid infinite loops with `perform_in` with inline testing. Perhaps a mention in the changelog would be good, because blocks don't work as they used to now, unless you can reconcile it with thread-safety. I'll be adapting tests to avoid this (use global mode `inline` instead of the first block).\r\n\r\nUpdate: Also, jobs pushed in `Sidekiq::Batch` now execute after the jobs block, even in inline mode, which again breaks some mocking.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6072/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/1794062414","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6069#issuecomment-1794062414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6069","id":1794062414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADDA9M5q7zhO","user":{"login":"kranzky","id":38485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky","html_url":"https://github.com/kranzky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kranzky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-06T04:22:37Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T04:23:19Z","body":"Is it a problem that we use Fiber-local variables instead of Thread-local variables for this?
