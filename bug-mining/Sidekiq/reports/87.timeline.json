Consider this common deploy scenario: you want to restart Sidekiq.\n1. Stop sidekiq PID 123\n2. Start sidekiq PID 456\n3. Sidekiq PID 456 writes its PID to PID file\n4. Sidekiq PID 123 finishes shutting down and deletes the PID file.\n\nYou now have a running Sidekiq with no PID file.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/49776938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/49781709","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1470#issuecomment-49781709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1470","id":49781709,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzgxNzA5","user":{"login":"jbarreneche","id":98871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche","html_url":"https://github.com/jbarreneche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarreneche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-22T18:37:24Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T18:37:24Z","body":"I understand the problem, but by taking the road of sidekiq process writting its own pid then it should cleanup what it created.
