I'm not super familiar with best practices for how to trim or customize the output of `to_s` or `inspect`. Anyone have more info or good reference material on the subject? Should I allowlist only known good instance_variables to log? Should I log everything except Procs, etc? Opinions welcome.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/2549185635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/2549217377","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6553#issuecomment-2549217377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6553","id":2549217377,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADDA9M6X8fhh","user":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-17T18:04:28Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T18:04:28Z","body":"Current plan: override `to_s` and `inspect` on `Sidekiq::Component`. That should get us sane output for a large amount of the internal Sidekiq state.
