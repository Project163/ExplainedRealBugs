there! We are currently testing the Sidekiq 7.1.4 > 7.1.5 update in our codebase, and we suspect this change might have something to do with an issue we see when applying the update. In our case, a workflow needs to run a `done` callback on _success_. \r\n\r\nWe have a test that will verify that the `done` method on the expected class will be called (using RSpec mock verifications), which used to work correctly before but is now failing.\r\n\r\nI can't share the actual code here, but this is something very similar to what we're running:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nit \"tests the worker sequence triggered by the workflow\" do\r\n  Sidekiq::Testing.inline! do\r\n    expect(WorkerA).to receive(:perform_async).once.ordered\r\n    expect(WorkerB).to receive(:perform_async).once.ordered\r\n    expect(WorkerC).to receive(:perform_async).once.ordered\r\n    # etc.\r\n    \r\n    # This is the assertion that's failing with 7.1.5\r\n    expect_any_instance_of(described_class).to receive(:done) \r\n\r\n    described_class.perform_async(date)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould it be related to the change on this
