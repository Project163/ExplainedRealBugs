Update Sidekiq to version 7.3.7\r\n2. Navigate to https://WEBSITE/sidekiq/morgue.\r\n3. Click on a display tag next to a dead job\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nRedirect to a filtered morgue page\r\nRoute: `https://WEBSITE/sidekiq/morgue?substr=mytag`\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nRedirected to home page, since the route does not exist\r\nRoute: `https://WEBSITE/sidekiq/dead?substr=mytag`\r\n\r\nI suspect [this line](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/v7.3.7/web/views/morgue.erb#L43) is the cause?
