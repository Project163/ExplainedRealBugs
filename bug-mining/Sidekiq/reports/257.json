(live update enabled)\r\nIt would be helpful to recognize a long term running job. \r\nI see a job, running 2 minutes, the next second the job is gone. No the job is not finished. The job jumped just to the end of the list, to jump to another position seconds later...\r\n\r\nWhen the list is sorted by it's started_at time, then the job doesn't fly out of sight.
