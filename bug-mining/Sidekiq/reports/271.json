The code in question schedules workers dynamically into different queues. So, when writing the scheduling code using perform_bulk, I updated it to use `set(queue: queue_name)` as the [announcement shows](https://www.mikeperham.com/2021/11/07/whats-new-in-sidekiq-6.3/#bulk-perform). \r\n\r\nSo, the new code looked like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbatch = Sidekiq::Batch.new\r\nbatch.jobs do\r\n  ExampleWorker.set(queue: \"example\").perform_bulk(array_of_args_arrays)\r\nend\r\n```\r\nOnce I started testing this code, I noticed that the workers were being scheduled into our default queue instead of the specific queues they should have gone into. When investigating this issue, I took a look at where Sidekiq::Worker.set is defined and made an extremely superficial analysis of the underlying code. I noticed that Sidekiq::Setter#set runs `@opts.merge!(options)`, which presumably would merge in the symbol key of `:queue`, and then I noticed that elsewhere, @opts keys were being accessed as strings. On a hunch, I decided to try changing `queue` to a string to see if it being merged into @opts as a string would solve the issue. I didn't really expect it to make a difference, but it actually did fix the issue. The current code, which looks like this, properly puts the workers into their queues:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbatch = Sidekiq::Batch.new\r\nbatch.jobs do\r\n  ExampleWorker.set(\"queue\" => \"example\").perform_bulk(array_of_args_arrays)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then tried changing the code to use a standard perform_async instead of perform_bulk and to queue each worker individually, like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbatch = Sidekiq::Batch.new\r\nbatch.jobs do\r\n  jobs_to_queue.each do |job|\r\n    ExampleWorker.set(queue: \"example\").perform_async(job[:args])\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked as expected, putting the workers into the correct queues. Therefore, I concluded that the string/symbol key issue is exclusive to perform_bulk.\r\n\r\nI've included the batch creation code around the examples I've given because these workers are executing in a batch. I don't actually think it's related to them being in batches, but I also can't say it isn't, so I've included the batch code in the interest of including as much context as possible.","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5081/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
