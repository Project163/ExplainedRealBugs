ran into an issue where the json gem was a different version in production then in development.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example to demonstrate how this happened.\r\n\r\n    $ cat Gemfile\r\n    source 'https://rubygems.org'\r\n\r\n    gem 'jwt'\r\n\r\n    group :test do\r\n      gem 'simplecov'\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    $ cat Gemfile.lock \r\n    GEM\r\n      remote: https://rubygems.org/\r\n      specs:\r\n        docile (1.1.5)\r\n        json (2.0.3)\r\n        jwt (1.5.6)\r\n        simplecov (0.13.0)\r\n          docile (~> 1.1.0)\r\n          json (>= 1.8, < 3)\r\n          simplecov-html (~> 0.10.0)\r\n        simplecov-html (0.10.0)\r\n\r\n    PLATFORMS\r\n      ruby\r\n\r\n    DEPENDENCIES\r\n      jwt\r\n      simplecov\r\n\r\n    BUNDLED WITH\r\n       1.13.7\r\n\r\nSince the json gem is part of a standard Ruby installation, jwt is able to use it without listing it as a dependency.  `Bundler.setup` doesn't prevent jwt code from using `require 'json'` without it in the Gemfile.\r\n\r\nHowever, it will use whatever version comes with Ruby (json 1.8.7 if you're using Ruby 2.3.0) unless json is listed in Gemfile.lock.  In the example above, json is in Gemfile.lock for test but not for production.  This is very dangerous!  My tests all pass, but the same code does unexpected things in production.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, one could argue that this is a bug in jwt, not in bundler.  However, it's a very easy mistake for a gem developer to make, and jwt is not the only one in my Gemfile guilty of this.  Other gems with the same issue include **pg, mime-types, rack, graphql, aws-sdk-core, and just about every component of rails.**  So even if I were to open an issue on each of these projects, the list would keep on coming since it's such an easy mistake to make.\r\n\r\nI propose that bundler should mitigate this.  The solution I can think of (there may be other ways bundler can solve this problem) is for bundler to enforce that if a gem is in Gemfile.lock, even if it's in an excluded group, no other version of that gem can be required (i.e. fail when `Bundler.setup` or `require 'json'` is called in production--whichever comes second).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rubygems/bundler/issues/5419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rubygems/bundler/issues/5419/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"javierjulio","id":198547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio","html_url":"https://github.com/javierjulio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-14T19:19:03Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T19:19:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/connect-ruby-sdk/issues/36","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/connect-ruby-sdk","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/connect-ruby-sdk/issues/36/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/connect-ruby-sdk/issues/36/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/connect-ruby-sdk/issues/36/events","html_url":"https://github.com/square/connect-ruby-sdk/issues/36","id":331011502,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzEwMTE1MDI=","number":36,"title":"Allow
