Sometimes we get exceptions where I'm working on a fix, and I'd like the job to stop retrying while I fix (maybe because it uses up resources) -- but I'd still like to keep the job around and retry it later. It would be cool to save the dead job in the morgue, then \"resurrect\" it when I'm ready to try again.\n","closed_by":{"login":"seuros","id":2394703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTQ3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2394703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros","html_url":"https://github.com/seuros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seuros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/1866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
