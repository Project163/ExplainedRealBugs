Heroku will only allow RTG to modify the ENV var called REDISTOGO_URL in your app.  So if RTG wants to migrate you seamlessly to another datacenter, your app uses their variable directly and they modify the value so that on reboot, your app picks up the new Redis instance.  REDIS_URL is not a thing they can control.  Sidekiq supports it for those people who want to run and manage their own Redis instance.\r\n\r\nSince there are many Redis service providers, you use REDIS_PROVIDER to tell Sidekiq which ENV var is the live Redis and Sidekiq will use that variable to find Redis.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/445895474/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2016517265,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjAxNjUxNzI2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/2016517265","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-10T17:14:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/comments/445954801","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3969#issuecomment-445954801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3969","id":445954801,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTk1NDgwMQ==","user":{"login":"Tensho","id":892721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MjcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/892721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho","html_url":"https://github.com/Tensho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tensho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T20:09:03Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T20:09:03Z","body":"Got
