Keep the sidekiq process running\r\n2. Pause a queue `Sidekiq::Queue.new(:queue_name).pause!`\r\n3. Unpause the queue `Sidekiq::Queue.new(:queue_name).unpause!`. Remember using the symbol as the queue name.\r\n4. Monitor if it drains your pending jobs from the queue.\r\n\r\nWe are building a system that automatically pauses a queue after a specific error scenario. And later it unpauses by the manual intervention. \r\n\r\nWe are using `Sidekiq::Queue#pause!` and `unpause!` methods to accomplish that goal.\r\n\r\n### What didn't work?\r\n\r\nWe encountered that whenever we unpaused a queue the `Sidekiq::Pro::SuperFetch::Retriever#active_queues` doesn't reflect the change. It keeps excluding the paused queue.  \r\n\r\nAfter further checking `Sidekiq::Pro::SuperFetch::Retriever#notify` method has the following piece of code that doesn't cast to string if we pass the queue name as a symbol. \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# line: 146\r\n@paused.delete payload\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What was our fix?\r\n\r\nWe forcefully cast to string before using `Sidekiq::Queue.new(queue_name.to_s).unpause!`. \r\n\r\n### What could have been okay?\r\n\r\nSidekiq handled the symbol to string casting automatically or raises an error somewhere in the process. So we could know the scenario.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
