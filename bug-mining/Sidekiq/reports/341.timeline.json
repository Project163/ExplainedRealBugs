Issue Description\n\nSidekiq [v7.3.8](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/releases/tag/v7.3.8) always requires its ActiveJob adapter now. That means that a top-level `ActiveJob` module will be defined, even if active_job itself isn't loaded nor configured at all.\n\nSince Sentry tries to load its ActiveJob job when the top-level [`ActiveJob` constant exists](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/blob/5.22.1/sentry-rails/app/jobs/sentry/send_event_job.rb#L3), this error happens:\n\n```\nFailure/Error: require

too.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nTry to start a demo Rails application that does not load ActiveJob but Sidekiq 7.3.8.\n\nTo not load ActiveJob, adjust `application.rb` like this:\n\n```ruby\n# frozen_string_literal: true\n\nrequire_relative 'boot'\n\nrequire 'rails'\n# Pick the frameworks you want:\nrequire 'active_model/railtie'\n# require 'active_job/railtie'\nrequire 'active_record/railtie'\n# require 'active_storage/engine'\nrequire 'action_controller/railtie'\n# require 'action_mailer/railtie'\n# require 'action_mailbox/engine'\n# require 'action_text/engine'\nrequire 'action_view/railtie'\n# require 'action_cable/engine'\nrequire 'rails/test_unit/railtie'\n\n# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems\n# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.\nBundler.require(*Rails.groups)\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNot to break.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nApps don't boot anymore (https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/6584).\n\n### Ruby Version\n\n3.3.5\n\n### SDK Version\n\n5.22.1\n\n### Integration and Its Version\n\nRails, Sidekiq\n\n### Sentry Config\n\n```ruby\nSentry.init do |config|\n  # Far too many exception when sidekiq workers are just reconnecting\n  config.excluded_exceptions += %w[Redis::CannotConnectError RedisClient::CannotConnectError]\n\n  # Do not send full list of gems with each event\n  config.send_modules = false\nend\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/2517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/2517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16046333240,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADDA9M6nFqc6zwAAAAO8b504","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/16046333240","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"886e4349f1d6a9f82f2764e4a3e7c7cf4b9113ee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/commits/886e4349f1d6a9f82f2764e4a3e7c7cf4b9113ee","created_at":"2025-01-23T16:06:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16046361080,"node_id":"CE_lADOADDA9M6nFqc6zwAAAAO8cAn4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/16046361080","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5d62829e80c2a1d74492acfe4a56d1fbe073266b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/commits/5d62829e80c2a1d74492acfe4a56d1fbe073266b","created_at":"2025-01-23T16:08:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16047314523,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADDA9M6nFqc6zwAAAAO8fpZb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/16047314523","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5d62829e80c2a1d74492acfe4a56d1fbe073266b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stnxo2023/sidekiq/commits/5d62829e80c2a1d74492acfe4a56d1fbe073266b","created_at":"2025-01-23T17:17:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"solnic","id":1066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/solnic","html_url":"https://github.com/solnic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solnic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solnic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solnic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solnic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/solnic/subscriptions
