From what I understand, `exit` does not wait for `ensure` blocks to finish execution. This is reproduced in the following example :\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nth = Thread.fork do\r\n  sleep 100\r\nensure\r\n  puts \"clean up\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nsleep 1\r\nth.raise StandardError\r\nexit(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"clean up\" is never printed. @mperham
