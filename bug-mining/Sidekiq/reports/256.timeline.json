href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement. If you have code in your initializer for\nWeb sessions, it's quite possible it will need to be removed. Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection.

href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4804\">#4804</a>\nNumerous people have hit &quot;Forbidden&quot; errors and struggled with Sidekiq's\nWeb UI session requirement.

Here's\nan overview:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Sidekiq::Web needs a valid Rack session for CSRF protection. If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n<h2>6.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn if Redis is configured to evict data under memory pressure <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4752\">#4752</a></li>\n<li>Add process RSS on the Busy page <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4717\">#4717</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6.1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve readability in dark mode Web UI <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4674\">#4674</a></li>\n<li>Fix Web UI crash with corrupt session <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4672\">#4672</a></li>\n<li>Allow middleware to yield arguments [#4673, <a href=\"https://github.com/eugeneius\"><code>@​eugeneius</code></a>]</li>\n<li>Migrate CI from CircleCI to GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4677\">#4677</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Jobs are now sorted by age in the Busy Workers table. <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4641\">#4641</a></li>\n<li>Fix &quot;check all&quot; JS logic in Web UI <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4619\">#4619</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.0...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.0&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

If this is a Rails app,\nmake sure you mount Sidekiq::Web *inside* your routes in `config/routes.rb` so\nSidekiq can reuse the Rails session:\n<p>Rails.application.routes.draw do\nmount Sidekiq::Web =&gt; &quot;/sidekiq&quot;\n....\nend</p>\n<p>If this is a bare Rack app, use a session middleware before Sidekiq::Web:</p>\n<h1>first, use IRB to create a shared secret key for sessions and commit it</h1>\n<p>require 'securerandom'; File.open(&quot;.session.key&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) {|f| f.write(SecureRandom.hex(32)) }</p>\n<h1>now, update your Rack app to include the secret with a session cookie middleware</h1>\n<p>use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: File.read(&quot;.session.key&quot;), same_site: true, max_age: 86400\nrun Sidekiq::Web\n</code></pre></p>\n<h2>6.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn if Redis is configured to evict data under memory pressure <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4752\">#4752</a></li>\n<li>Add process RSS on the Busy page <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4717\">#4717</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6.1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve readability in dark mode Web UI <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4674\">#4674</a></li>\n<li>Fix Web UI crash with corrupt session <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4672\">#4672</a></li>\n<li>Allow middleware to yield arguments [#4673, <a href=\"https://github.com/eugeneius\"><code>@​eugeneius</code></a>]</li>\n<li>Migrate CI from CircleCI to GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4677\">#4677</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Jobs are now sorted by age in the Busy Workers table. <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4641\">#4641</a></li>\n<li>Fix &quot;check all&quot; JS logic in Web UI <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4619\">#4619</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/a412dc2d1d6c50c77c86957c0ef526d5fe53ee74\"><code>a412dc2</code></a> prep for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/38d6abbf16116ce6eaaa881c010f7e1293c60169\"><code>38d6abb</code></a> optimize PNGs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/9aeba313a9520fe05a47515dc30158428b40e8d8\"><code>9aeba31</code></a> Some mobile UI polish, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4840\">#4840</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/269399607d17744baf5d1385de4774b6878ca5ec\"><code>2693996</code></a> bumpity bump</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/561f0bfae857a740c3bbb44bb2e9a439840c6dab\"><code>561f0bf</code></a> Don't hardcode URI scheme of redis connection url (<a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4839\">#4839</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/25ed7c7e39b1e08f69e1ad5a63c036acabc9e31a\"><code>25ed7c7</code></a> Update gemspec with files whitelist</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/7b2bbeec3f13a2369b0b560e0b6ac953c8e4ee71\"><code>7b2bbee</code></a> standard 1.0, update format exceptions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/90190e0dc40744cb07a12291e5ecc20b069981b6\"><code>90190e0</code></a> you are annoying, standard</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/823125f941138a87f44ce2ca63eb2baf5fde038d\"><code>823125f</code></a> Add all of the links!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/ed8483784348976edc3943ec235bde14e4626210\"><code>ed84837</code></a> handle case where all queues are paused, fixes <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/4825\">#4825</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/compare/v6.1.0...v6.2.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sidekiq&package-manager=bundler&previous-version=6.1.0&new-version=6.2.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
