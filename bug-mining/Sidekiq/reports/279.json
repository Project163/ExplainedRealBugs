I believe that the intention is that they are consistent\r\n\r\nWould you accept a PR where I try to:\r\n1. refactor `Sidekiq::Client#push` to call `Sidekiq::Client#push_bulk` as it's just a special case of having one job to push\r\n2. refactor `Sidekiq::Worker` to always use `Sidekiq::Client#push_bulk` so there's one interaction point between `Worker` and `Client`\r\n3. (optionally) introduce lightweight dependency injection of `Client` so that it's possible to provide custom client implementation for `Worker` - for example through worker options\r\n\r\n? Or am I missing some practical considerations here?","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
