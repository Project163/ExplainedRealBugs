is a follow up to #2985 (52828e4) adding similar support for the client connection pool. For Rails servers, Sidekiq is not loaded from the CLI so the prior change to support setting the concurrency via `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` is not applied to the web server process. This means for Rails servers which do not configure a custom size through an initializer they will run with the default connection pool size of 5.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rails server runs the initial Redis connection may be made through `Sidekiq::Client` (e.g. from [`ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::SidekiqAdapter`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.1.5/activejob/lib/active_job/queue_adapters/sidekiq_adapter.rb#L20)). This causes the `redis_pool` to be initialized without any options, setting the pool size to the default of 5.\r\n\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/sidekiq-5.1.1/lib/sidekiq.rb:125:in `redis_pool'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/sidekiq-5.1.1/lib/sidekiq/client.rb:42:in `initialize'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/sidekiq-5.1.1/lib/sidekiq/client.rb:131:in `new'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/sidekiq-5.1.1/lib/sidekiq/client.rb:131:in `push'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/queue_adapters/sidekiq_adapter.rb:20:in `enqueue'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/enqueuing.rb:51:in `block in enqueue'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.5/lib/active_support/callbacks.rb:108:in `block in run_callbacks'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/logging.rb:15:in `block (3 levels) in <module:Logging>'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/logging.rb:44:in `block in tag_logger'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.5/lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:69:in `block in tagged'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.5/lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:26:in `tagged'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.5/lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:69:in `tagged'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/logging.rb:44:in `tag_logger'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/logging.rb:14:in `block (2 levels) in <module:Logging>'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.5/lib/active_support/callbacks.rb:117:in `instance_exec'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.5/lib/active_support/callbacks.rb:117:in `block in run_callbacks'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activesupport-5.1.5/lib/active_support/callbacks.rb:135:in `run_callbacks'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/enqueuing.rb:47:in `enqueue'\r\n    .gem/ruby/2.5.0/gems/activejob-5.1.5/lib/active_job/enqueuing.rb:18:in `perform_later'\r\n\r\nFor the majority of cases, a client pool size of 5 is sufficient. However, servers which utilize a high number of threads, with large job payloads, and which may experience some network latency issues can see `Timeout::Error` crashes. This may be further exacerbated by the ~2-20x performance decrease through `ActiveJob` (#3782). Rails addresses this general type of connection issue for the main database by suggesting that the DB pool size match the number of threads running. This change applies that logic to the default client pool size by leveraging the same environment setting; this way there's a connection available per thread.\r\n\r\nThis may also have the side effect of a slight performance boost, as there is less of a chance that threads will be blocked waiting on connections. The trade-off is that there may be a memory profile increase to handle the additional Redis connections in the pool; note the pool only creates new connections as necessary to handle the requests.\r\n\r\nResolves #3806","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3807/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1544394250,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTU0NDM5NDI1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/1544394250","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-27T22:46:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1544394274,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NDQzOTQyNzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/events/1544394274","actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b23c0ecf8ea18a6547d40fb9fe3b92eceed8107f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/commits/b23c0ecf8ea18a6547d40fb9fe3b92eceed8107f","created_at":"2018-03-27T22:46:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
