I was testing out the \"Stop\" button on the Busy tab while the browser had polling turned on in the Busy tab and got an error. As far as I can tell from looking at the stack trace, here's what happened:\r\n\r\n1. The processes were retrieved from Redis: https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/13f746a7a72c257ff4448de71f13d24182efff66/lib/sidekiq/api.rb#L696\r\n2. One of the processes was stopped via the Web UI.\r\n3. Data for each process was pulled from Redis: https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/13f746a7a72c257ff4448de71f13d24182efff66/lib/sidekiq/api.rb#L702\r\n4. The stopped process has no data in Redis, returning `nil` and causing the JSON parse to error out: https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/13f746a7a72c257ff4448de71f13d24182efff66/lib/sidekiq/api.rb#L709\r\n\r\nI'll whip up a quick pull request to fix.","closed_by":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/3452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
