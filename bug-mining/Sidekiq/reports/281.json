Unfortunately, with the recent changes to how strict arguments are enforced, this now raises a deprecation warning. \r\n\r\nWhile I fully understand and appreciate the tighter checks, I was wondering if it would make sense to do them _after_ the middleware chain or _as a part of_ the middleware chain?\r\n\r\nThis would still allow implementing custom serialization/deserialization schemes while also ensuring that only valid JSON gets into Sidekiq's core.
