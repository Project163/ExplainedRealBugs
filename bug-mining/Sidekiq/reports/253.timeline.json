the [Redis documentation for `exists`](https://redis.io/commands/exists), as of Redis 3.0.3 `exists` may take multiple key names and returns a count of the number of keys that exist.\r\n\r\nUsing the `redis-rb` gem v3.3.3, the result of [`Redis::exists`](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb/blob/19bbbc8dc1b75cfbaf3dd7e0a92a9ff72f474fb5/lib/redis.rb#L504) with an array of keys returns `true` *if and only if* just one of the keys exist. `false` is returned if none of the keys exist **or if multiple keys do** because `Boolify` looks for a non-nil value equal to 1.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n```ruby\r\nr = Redis.new\r\nr.mset 'test1', 1, 'test2', 2\r\nr.exists ['test1', 'nonexistant']\r\n#=> true\r\nr.exists ['test1', 'test2']\r\n#=> false\r\n```\r\nSo either `Boolify` could be adjusted to look for values `>= 1`, or (what makes more sense to me) `Boolify` should not be used in this function so that the return value is the count of the number of keys found as is described in the Redis docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis-rb/issues/698/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis-rb/issues/698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mperham","id":2911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham","html_url":"https://github.com/mperham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mperham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-11T18:56:14Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T18:56:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4595","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4595/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4595/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4595/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/4595","id":637246861,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MzcyNDY4NjE=","number":4595,"title":"Hide
