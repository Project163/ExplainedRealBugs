The [new code in `wincolor_sink-inl.h`](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/blob/v1.x/include/spdlog/sinks/wincolor_sink-inl.h#L152) _throws_ if `WriteFile()` fails, although the old `WriteConsole()` still doesn't.\r\n\r\nThis broke our logging because we don't usually start a console, except in rare cases. Console logs used to be discarded silently, but now they throw. It's even worse because we're actually using a `dist_sink` and the console sink is the first one. Since `dist_sink` doesn't catch anything, _all_ logging now fails.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that if `GetConsoleMode()` returns false, spdlog assumes that `out_handle_` is a valid file handle. I would add a check for a null handle in `write_to_file_()` (and possibly `print_range_()`) to avoid throwing or even trying to write to it.\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering whether `dist_sink` should catch exceptions to allow the other sinks to do their work, but I'm not sure about that.","closed_by":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
