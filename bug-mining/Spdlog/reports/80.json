Additionally, when SPDLOG_LEVEL does exist but only specifies a couple logger's levels, the others have their levels overwritten to the default of info.\r\n\r\npseduo-code example:\r\n```\r\n// export SPDLOG_LEVEL=logger2=off\r\n\r\n// create \"logger1\" and set level to trace\r\nauto logger1{spdlog::stdout_color_mt(\"logger1\");\r\nlogger1->set_level(trace);\r\nspdlog::register_logger(logger1);\r\n\r\n// create \"logger2\" and set level to debug\r\nauto logger2{spdlog::stderr_color_mt(\"logger2\");\r\nlogger2->set_level(debug);\r\nspdlog::register_logger(logger2);\r\n\r\nspdlog:;cfg::load_env_levels();\r\n\r\n// logger2 is set to off level as expected, but logger1 is now set to info even though it wasn't specified in SPDLOG_LEVEL\r\n// if SPDLOG_LEVEL doesn't exist in the environment, both logger1 and logger2 would be set to info\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this by design? It's certainly annoying that a missing env var will reset the logger levels I have specified in my source code. I wouldn't expect a logger's level to change if it wasn't present in the env var.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, it looks like the argv processing suffers from this same behavior.","closed_by":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1680/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
