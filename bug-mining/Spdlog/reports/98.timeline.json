MangoHud appears completely non-functional since v. 0.6.7.1 update on my system, causing CTDs. \r\nWhen trying to run a windows application on Lutris through Wine, with MangoHud enabled through the Lutris advanced interface, I get an output similar to this (My actual username was redacted and replaced with a generic \"Username\"), and subsequently a CTD of the entire Wine-Stack and Wine-Server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlutris-wrapper: Tomb Raider II\r\nStarted initial process 6636 from mangohud /home/username/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/lutris-6.21-6-x86_64/bin/wine /home/username/Games/Tomb Raider II/Tomb2.exe\r\nStart monitoring process.\r\n/home/username/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/lutris-6.21-6-x86_64/bin/wine: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib32/mangohud/libMangoHud.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6spdlog5sinks18rotating_file_sinkISt5mutexEC1ENSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEEjjb\r\nMonitored process exited.\r\nInitial process has exited (return code: 32512)\r\nAll processes have quit\r\nExit with return code 32512\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough this output utilizes \"Tomb2.exe\", this happens with all kinds of windows applications relying upon Direct3D7-8-9-10-11, as far as I can test. Thus, all kinds of Direct3D applications seem to be affected (Don't have Direct3D12 applications to test). The \"undefined symbol\" seems also to vary depending on utilized .ext, but this is probably to be expected. \r\nThis output also happens both with the generic WineD3D wrapper (When compatible with the executable), and with DXVK. Thus, wrappers seem not to affect output. \r\nAlthough the output mentions `lutris-6.21-6-x86_64` Wine version, I can confirm this happens also on `lutris-7.2-x86_64` Wine version (Most recent Wine version on Lutris). Similarly, this also happens on older Lutris-Wine versions. Wine version thus seems not to affect output. \r\nNo CTDs happen if MangoHud is disabled through the Lutris advanced interface.\r\n\r\nRelevant specs are as follows:\r\n```\r\nOS: Void Linux\r\nGPU Architecture: AMD Polaris 20 GPU on GCN 4.0 architecture\r\nKernel: Linux v. 5.15.41\r\nDrivers: AMDGPU OpenSource + MESA RADV + AMD RADV OpenSource \r\nLibraries: Mesa 21.3.7, Mesa-Dri 21.3.7 Mesa-Vulkan-Radeon 21.3.7, Mesa-Vulkan-Overlay-Layer 21.3.7\r\n```\r\nCan confirm `MangoHud-0.6.5_1` (Previous package installed on my system) was working perfectly. \r\n\r\nAlthough I could technically revert package version, I'll hold unto if developers need some further outputs. \r\nOnly similar issues I could find is the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/issues/772\r\n\r\nExcept, compared to the aforementioned GitHub issue, `MangoHud 0.6.7.1` is non-functional ALSO in Lutris on my end, and I'm away from my Steam machine, thus I can't test MangoHud with Steam. \r\n\r\nKind Regards, and Thank You for your
