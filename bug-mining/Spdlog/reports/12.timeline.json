PR makes MinGW, one of windows compiler, be able to compile the ginkgo library (shared/static).\r\nIt is part of #281 \r\n\r\nThe requirement is git, mingw(64bit), and WSL.\r\nWSL is used to run the bash to update the header automatically.\r\n\r\n1. gflags library's name is gflags_nothreads_static.lib in WINDOWS\r\n2. std::this_thread::sleep_for does not sleep for the duration of nanosecond. [reference](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/609)\r\nThe implementation depends on the compiler/system. the clock uses system_clock not steady_clock\r\nNow, use `Sleep(millisecond)` in `windows.h` for testings. Moreover, change the clock of `stop/time` according to #293. The picture in the end shows `sleep_for` doesn't work as we expect.\r\n3. `update_ginkgo_header.sh` can handle `\\r` in Windows.\r\n4. Windows creates two files for one shared library, one is for compile and the other is for runtime.\r\nBut windows does not have rpath for runtime library searching. I add the output in the end of cmake about the settings. Users need to add them manually for run the program.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"306\" alt=\"sleep_test\"
