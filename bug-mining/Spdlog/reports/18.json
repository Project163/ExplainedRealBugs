From the log, the error occurs at https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/blob/v1.x/include/spdlog/details/registry.h#L81. I first noticed this error on commit ce5c1c2, though unfortunately I'm not sure what the last working commit was (I know it was sometime after cdbf2e3?)\r\n\r\nThe simplest program that reproduces this behavior is:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include \"spdlog/spdlog.h\"\r\n#include \"spdlog/sinks/stdout_color_sinks.h\"\r\n\r\nint main(void) {\r\n  auto log = spdlog::stdout_color_mt(\"test\");\r\n\r\n  log->info(\"Hello!\");\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm happy to provide whatever details, etc. help with debugging!
