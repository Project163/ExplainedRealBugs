attempted to build the latest master (fe2978f17) with CMake 3.22.3 and while the build succeeds, no dsound.dll is provided in the build directory or any other directories in the project. This seems to be a behavior change with CMake versions starting from 3.17 from the GH post here: https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/1523.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMake Warning (dev) at C:/Users/Jonathan/Desktop/cmake-3.22.3-windows-x86_64/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/GNUInstallDirs.cmake:239 (message):\r\n  Unable to determine default CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR directory because no\r\n  target architecture is known.

This will allow downstream consumers to be able to easily test and provide these binaries to their users if needed. Ideally the linked OpenAL dll would also be included in the project as well (While giving credit to upstream) in order to allow the dll to be more easily used. At the moment there are too many steps for regular users to use this effectively, requiring someone with more knowledge to package it all up for them. I'm personally fine doing this for my users even if it creates a bit more maintenance burden for me, but I wanted to express that point.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've also tried getting an older version of CMake (The current documentation says CMake 2.6 or later), I was able to find an old CMake 2.6.4 (x86) build. Attempting to build with that one said the minimum CMake version for the project is 3.0.2. After that I found a CMake 3.0.2 build (x86) but had issues building it given the difference in toolchain versions and maybe some possible misconfiguration -.-.\r\n \r\nJonathan","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kcat/dsoal/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kcat/dsoal/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8099439775,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAY1ReM4j8ElOzwAAAAHiw6Sf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/events/8099439775","actor":{"login":"bachittle","id":39804642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODA0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39804642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle","html_url":"https://github.com/bachittle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"22f07a0c3a85cd0ade303b1ae959b01e8865644e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bachittle/spdlog/commits/22f07a0c3a85cd0ade303b1ae959b01e8865644e","created_at":"2022-12-22T21:57:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
