As long as the end result is a dynamic library (either directly, or by first creating a static library which is then linked into a dynamic library), `-fPIC` is useful. This can also be gleaned from the [gcc manual](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Code-Gen-Options.html): \r\n\r\n> Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared library ...\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not creating a shared library anywhere in my workflow. I make a static library and link it directly into an executable. Therefore, I use `-fpie` (since my GOT tables aren't too big to need to use `-fPIE`) and `-fPIC` has no effect on the problem at hand. I know, because I've added it to the compiler flags and it resulted in the same error I mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI have bisected the problem to [6725584e27ca93f50527165696d7cf34e3978373](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/commit/6725584e27ca93f50527165696d7cf34e3978373). And specifically, the call to `set_value()` in [thread_pool-inl.h:115](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/commit/6725584e27ca93f50527165696d7cf34e3978373#diff-6c9b5dd2454f632886023e6bc86e7b04fe7d0f1be5c25d505679987a7da7b05dR115). \r\n\r\n`promise<>::set_value()` ends up calling [std::call_once](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/8fc1a49c9312b05d925b7d21f1d2145d70818151/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/future#L426), which requires thread local storage and GCC requires the glibcxx once_callable symbol (which is probably some pthread_once alias). `ftls-model=local-exec` disables the usage of `thread_local` storage which has not been defined inside the executable itself. And the `once_callable` symbol resides in `libc.so.6`. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, unfortunately, gcc has had a [pretty bad bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66146) with `std::call_once` and exceptions since gcc 5.x, making it impossible to support handling exceptions during a `std::call_once` call on musl and other non-glibc, non-x86 targets. Not the case here, but certainly something to consider.\r\n\r\nThe options I see are as follows:\r\n* Change compiler flags to `ftls-model=initial-exec`, losing some performance whenever I access `thread_local` variables\r\n* Refactor the `std::promise`/`std::future` to a `std::function` of sorts.\r\n* Patch out the specific commit in my own
