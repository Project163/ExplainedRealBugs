For a library author it might not be the best idea because then you'll have two `msvc` classes which could lead to confusion.\r\n* If instead you put in an `#ifdef` or `if consteval` or something around the debugger check, then you give a configuration point and complicate the library and code. You also wouldn't be able to switch it at runtime.\r\n* The third option is to add another runtime check so you'd first check if we want to check then check if it's enabled, which is adding a bit more runtime overhead to what is otherwise a lean system.\r\n\r\nThis is the hard part of library design.\r\n\r\nThe strongest argument I have for not adding the `IsDebuggerPresent` check is that it will change the timings of when the code is running with and without the debugger attached. This could affect timings and show/hide issues with threads.\r\n\r\nMaybe the answer is for me to implement my own `msvc_sink` class in my own code with this behaviour and be done with it, so the library version can remain simple and more deterministic.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/comments/1159688497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DominikGrabiec","id":81088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec","html_url":"https://github.com/DominikGrabiec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DominikGrabiec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/comments/1159794495","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/2408#issuecomment-1159794495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/2408","id":1159794495,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAY1ReM5FIQ8_","user":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-19T19:10:00Z","updated_at":"2022-06-19T19:10:00Z","body":"If there is a big performance gain (any numbers?)
