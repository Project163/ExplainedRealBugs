ask this question to clarify the cause of the spdlog library issue (gabime/spdlog#2735).\r\n\r\nAfter updating the fmt version from 9.1.0 to 10.0.0 in spdlog library, the following code now causes \"invalid format\" error.\r\nfmt 10 is not yet available for selection in Compiler Explorer, so I am checking the behavior with the latest sources.\r\n\r\n[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/K9PWKGr8z)\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n#include <ctime>\r\n#include <time.h>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    std::time_t now_t = ::time(nullptr);\r\n

format string will be `fmt::print(\"{:example-%Y-%m-%d.log}\", tm);`.\r\n\r\nI could not find the relevant spec change in the version 10 CHANGELOG.\r\nHowever, looking at the `chrono_specs`, it appears that left hand side literals were not allowed.\r\n\r\nhttps://fmt.dev/10.0.0/syntax.html#chrono-format-specifications\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n>    chrono_format_spec: [[`fill`]`align`][`width`][\".\"

| \"W\" | \"x\" | \"X\" | \"y\" | \"Y\" | \"z\" | \"Z\" | \"%\"\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nChange the code as follows and the error will no longer occur with fmt 10.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n #include <ctime>\r\n #include <time.h>\r\n \r\n int main() {\r\n     std::time_t now_t = ::time(nullptr);\r\n     std::tm tm{};\r\n     ::localtime_r(&now_t, &tm);\r\n\r\n-    auto

earlier, literals could appear on the left hand side of `chrono_specs`.
