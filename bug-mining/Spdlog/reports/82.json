the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include \"spdlog/spdlog.h\"\r\n#include \"spdlog/sinks/stdout_sinks.h\"\r\n#include \"spdlog/sinks/stdout_color_sinks.h\"\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    std::shared_ptr<spdlog::logger> logger1 = spdlog::stdout_logger_st(\"one\");\r\n    logger1->set_pattern(\"%v\");\r\n    logger1->info(\"hello\");\r\n\r\n    std::shared_ptr<spdlog::logger> logger2 = spdlog::stdout_color_st(\"two\");\r\n    logger2->set_pattern(\"%v\");\r\n    logger2->info(\"world\");\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we run this program on Windows and redirect the output to a file (`example.exe > output.txt`) and have a look at this output in a hex editor, we see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n68 65 6C 6C 6F 0D 0D 0A 77 6F 72 6C 64 0D 0A\r\nh  e  l  l  o  \\r \\r \\n w  o  r  l  d  \\r \\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. `\"hello\\r\\r\\nworld\\r\\n\"` - notice the additional carriage return after \"hello\".\r\n\r\nI believe the first example can be explained because:\r\n\r\n1. `stdout_logger_st` uses `fwrite` to write to the `stdout` handle\r\n2. The formatter automatically appends `\\r\\n` by default\r\n3. `stdout` is opened in text mode according to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-mode-file-i-o (\"_The stdin, stdout, and stderr streams always open in text mode by default_\")\r\n4. Streams opened in text mode will automatically replace `\\n` with `\\r\\n` according to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fwrite (\"_If stream is opened in text mode, each line feed is replaced with a carriage return-line feed pair_\")\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because some programs interpret the `\\r\\r\\n` as two lines, resulting in all of the logs appearing with extra blank lines between them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can't explain is why the problem doesn't seem to happen with the color sink, which you can see from the output above produces the correct `\"world\\r\\n\"`.","closed_by":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
