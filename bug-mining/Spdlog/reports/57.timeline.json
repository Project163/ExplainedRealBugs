I think I will fix spdlog's CMakeLists.txt and addset(CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32 =1) if built under cygwin (and mingw?)\r\n\r\n@gabime I can't decide if that is a good solution.\r\n\r\nI have used MinGW a little with MSYS2.\r\nMinGW library did not work on Windows OS unless the `PATH` environment variable was set. Because it links with MinGW library. Therefore, the release for Windows OS felt complicated.\r\nThis problem also seems to be in Cygwin.\r\n\r\n* [Cygwin not working on Windows 10 \\(even after added to system's PATH\\) \\- Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45762633/cygwin-not-working-on-windows-10-even-after-added-to-systems-path)\r\n\r\nAlso, I think MinGW and Cygwin have an ABI compatibility problem with the MSVC library.\r\n\r\n* [windows \\- What is the difference between Cygwin and MinGW? \\- Stack

Windows environment variables and allows to use the Windows API with MinGW.\r\n\r\nBased on these facts, I believe that the developer decides whether to use the POSIX API or the Windows API, depending on which platform the library built with MinGW or Cygwin is used.\r\n\r\nFortunately, CMake can specify command line option `-DCMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=0 or 1` when building.\r\nI can't answer meson

it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/comments/563229830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tt4g","id":45120617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTIwNjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45120617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g","html_url":"https://github.com/tt4g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tt4g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2866237180,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjg2NjIzNzE4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/events/2866237180","actor":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T13:07:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2866237186,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4NjYyMzcxODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/events/2866237186","actor":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T13:07:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/comments/563259523","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/1347#issuecomment-563259523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1347","id":563259523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzI1OTUyMw==","user":{"login":"frankkopp","id":16833201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODMzMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16833201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp","html_url":"https://github.com/frankkopp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frankkopp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T14:20:17Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T14:21:15Z","body":">
