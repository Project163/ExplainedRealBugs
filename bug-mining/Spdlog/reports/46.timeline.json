point.  I think the solution is to take your proposal and add a const (see below).  It's the pointer that is const, not the pointed-to object that is const, so we can still call the non-const `log` method, and it gets us reference lifetime extension so should work in all cases.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#define SPDLOG_LOGGER_CALL(logger, level, ...)                            \\\r\n  do {                                                                    \\\r\n    const auto& SPDLOG_LOGGER_CALL_capture_logger = logger;               \\\r\n    if (SPDLOG_LOGGER_CALL_capture_logger->should_log(level) ||           \\\r\n        SPDLOG_LOGGER_CALL_capture_logger->should_backtrace()) {          \\\r\n      SPDLOG_LOGGER_CALL_capture_logger->log(                             \\\r\n          spdlog::source_loc{__FILE__, __LINE__, SPDLOG_FUNCTION}, level, \\\r\n          __VA_ARGS__);                                                   \\\r\n    }                                                                     \\\r\n  } while (0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/LuEB0b","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/comments/540563985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jwnimmer-tri","id":17596505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTk2NTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17596505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri","html_url":"https://github.com/jwnimmer-tri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwnimmer-tri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/comments/544573476","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/1262#issuecomment-544573476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1262","id":544573476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDU3MzQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"MuwazanaSA","id":55725699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzI1Njk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55725699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA","html_url":"https://github.com/MuwazanaSA","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MuwazanaSA/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-21T15:39:09Z","updated_at":"2019-10-21T15:39:09Z","body":"@Gabi120  @jwnimmer-tri What's an intermediate resolution to this to get going with this feature?
