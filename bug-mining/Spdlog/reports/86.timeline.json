you using C++11 or older? And are you using compiled or header only version or spdlog? Please give the full error output.\r\n\r\nI suspect this could be coming from constructor  `fmt::basic_string_view(const Char* s)` in `fmt/core.h:380`.\r\nThis is conditionally made constexpr by fmt for C++>=17 where it could have been made from C++ >= 14 in which the required constexpr features were made available. So this could be a potential issue for C++ 14 users.\r\n\r\nIdeally the flags should be changed in fmt function declarations. If you switch to C++ 17 this will not be a problem. \r\nIf you must use C++14, as a workaround you can change the `#if __cplusplus >= 201402L` at line 13 in `common-inl.h` to `#if __cplusplus >= 201703L` and see if it works.
