The other tweakme variables have cmake options as well, which makes things slightly nicer, or at least more uniform, when using spdlog as a dependency.\r\n\r\nWithout it being a proper option, you instead have to do something like this:\r\n```\r\noption(SPDLOG_NO_ATOMIC_LEVELS \"\" ON)\r\nadd_subdirectory(vendor/spdlog)\r\n# no cmake option for this for some reason\r\ntarget_compile_definitions(spdlog PRIVATE\r\n    SPDLOG_DISABLE_DEFAULT_LOGGER\r\n)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nor, when building from the command line, it's perhaps even more annoying:\r\n`CXXFLAGS=\"-DSPDLOG_DISABLE_DEFAULT_LOGGER\" cmake -S. -Bbuild -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DSPDLOG_NO_ATOMIC_LEVELS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`\r\n\r\n(CXXFLAGS here must be specified as an env var, rather than using the CMAKE_ version, or it will overwrite and not append.
