(other flags) ..\r\ncmake --build . --config Debug (or Release)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI got this error message.\r\n```\r\nstdout_sink-inl.h (18) fileapi.h : no such file or directory\r\n```\r\nSo I opened the inl file and found these lines.\r\n``` cpp\r\n#ifdef _WIN32\r\n// under windows using fwrite to non-binary stream results in \\r\\r\\n (see issue #1675)\r\n// so instead we use ::FileWrite\r\n#include <spdlog/details/windows_include.h>\r\n#include <fileapi.h> // WriteFile (..) //< ******this seemed to cause the error*******\r\n#include <io.h>      // _get_osfhandle(..)\r\n#include <stdio.h>   // _fileno(..)\r\n#endif               // WIN32\r\n```\r\nAfter doing some tests, I figured out that one cannot include `fileapi.h` when the version of Windows SDK for the project is set to 7.\r\nThen I changed the code somewhat like this and was able to get the lib file.\r\n``` cpp\r\n#ifdef _WIN32\r\n// ... \r\n#ifndef _USING_V110_SDK71_\r\n#include <fileapi.h> // WriteFile (..) //< ******this seemed to cause the error*******\r\n#endif\r\n// ...\r\n#endif               // WIN32\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is, is there any flag or option that I can set to build a lib for Windows xp?","closed_by":{"login":"wwriter","id":52746640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzQ2NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52746640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter","html_url":"https://github.com/wwriter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwriter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
