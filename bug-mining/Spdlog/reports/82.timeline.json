modern terminals on Windows now support ANSI color codes (this includes, e.g., Windows Terminal, and the good old console if created with the appropriate flags; see `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING`, starting from Windows 10). ANSI color codes have the advantage of being able to survive when stdout is piped, while Windows console color commands do not (in fact, the output is just lost if the colours are set to `always`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately:\r\n 1. When using spdlog built as a shared or static library, the `ansicolor_sink-inl.h` is never included in the library, therefore simply trying to include `ansicolor_sink.h` and using the class results in linker errors. This can be worked around by including `ansicolor_sink-inl.h` explicitly.\r\n 2. The ANSI color sink uses `::fwrite` unconditionally, which results in double carriage returns being printed on Windows. This is the same issue as https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/1675, which applied to the regular stdout sink, but now applies to the ANSI sink. The solution would be to use the same fix here, namely, use `::WriteFile` on Windows and `::fwrite` on linux.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/3138/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/3138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
