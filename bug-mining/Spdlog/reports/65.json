This makes it difficult to locally build the library from source, especially when used as Git Submodule. For example, when building the latest version v1.5.0, Clang-6.0 (available on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) issues the warning reported in #1488 that produces a fatal error. The warnings are not enabled for the header-only CMake target, but the [`README.md`](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog#static-lib-version-recommended---much-faster-compile-times) specifically recommends using the library target for faster compile times:\r\n\r\n> #### Static lib version (recommended - much faster compile times)\r\n\r\nWhile building a library without warnings is an important goal for developers, this information is not really useful for downstream users. And with `-Wfatal-errors`, it can actually cause trouble. Could all warning flags be conditionally set, e.g., via a CMake option?\r\n\r\n### Suggestions\r\n* Add CMake option `SPDLOG_ENABLE_WARNINGS` (default: `OFF`) for controlling the warnings on the `spdlog` library target.\r\n* Remove `-Wfatal-errors` from the \"regular warnings\" flag list.\r\n* Recommend linking to header-only target if spdlog is used as submodule (if previous suggestions are not feasible for some reason)","closed_by":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
