For example below\r\n\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'spdlog::spdlog_ex'\r\nwhat: async log: thread log does not exist anymore.\r\n\r\nI understand it crashed due to exit call from code. I dont want spdlog to crashes but ignore, and i will handle code errors myself, How could i do that.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for suggestions and help.","closed_by":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/2618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/2618/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
