I want to add a variable to the log pattern, I want that when I write the log message I also give the variable (lets say - id) , \r\nand it will print it.\r\nI saw the example of - ```class my_formatter_flag : public spdlog::custom_flag_formatter ```\r\nim not sure it does what I want , I added this class to one of my header files but got the compilation errors:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98874628/201913539-eac6dd1e-0a40-4eaf-bdfe-df946394ce4f.png)\r\nanyway - this what I have:\r\n```\r\nauto max_size = 10 * 1024 * 1024;   \r\nauto max_files = 200;\r\nlog_file_name = fmt::format(\"../logs/log_file_all.txt.{:%Y%m%d_%H:%M:%S}\", fmt::localtime(t));\r\nauto log_file_all =std::make_shared<spdlog::sinks::rotating_file_sink_mt>(log_file_name, max_size, max_files);\r\nlog_file_all->set_pattern(\"%^ [%=14n]  [%=8l] [source: %s]    %v%$\"); \r\n     ........\r\nauto logger = std::make_shared<spdlog::logger>(name, sinks.begin(), sinks.end());\r\nlogger->set_level(spdlog::level::trace); \r\nspdlog::register_logger(logger);\r\n```\r\nI would like to write something like this:\r\n```\r\nlog_file_all->set_pattern(\"%^ [%=14n]     **[%id]**     [%=8l] [source: %s]    %v%$\"); \r\n```\r\nand than when I use it in my src file I will do :\r\n```\r\nSPDLOG_LOGGER_INFO(spdlog::get(logger), **id** ,msg);\r\n```\r\nIs there a way to to
