So there are two possible approaches looking from `journald`'s perspective:\r\n- Reuse the formatter and put the logger name into the `MESSAGE` string. Advantage: the logger name gets shown with no extra work. Disadvantage: it cannot be extracted in a machine-readable way.\r\n- Put in an extra field just for the logger name. Advantage: allows for filtering, etc. Disadvantage: `journalctl` default output does not support showing arbitrary extra fields. But on a second thought, there's the `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` which looks exactly like that part that could be useful. No inofrmation should be lost because there's always the `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` which cannot be overwritten, so if the app is running as a systemd unit, everything is fine.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/comments/547801052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jktjkt","id":2631925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2631925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt","html_url":"https://github.com/jktjkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2755291025,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NTUyOTEwMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/events/2755291025","actor":{"login":"jktjkt","id":2631925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2631925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt","html_url":"https://github.com/jktjkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e9d4dc2a5f520081d8b74f73f6bf68e75b3becc0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jktjkt/spdlog/commits/e9d4dc2a5f520081d8b74f73f6bf68e75b3becc0","created_at":"2019-10-30T09:58:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2755869679,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3NTU4Njk2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/events/2755869679","actor":{"login":"jktjkt","id":2631925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2631925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt","html_url":"https://github.com/jktjkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e1ea86761442489e9bb845460823fd9bd547fb8f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jktjkt/spdlog/commits/e1ea86761442489e9bb845460823fd9bd547fb8f","created_at":"2019-10-30T13:00:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jktjkt","id":2631925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2631925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt","html_url":"https://github.com/jktjkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jktjkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T13:09:14Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T13:09:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/1292","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog","labels_url":"http

three patches which make it easier to use `systemd`/`journald`'s structured logging. When everything is in place, one can, for example, watch the log stream via this user-friendly :) command:\r\n\r\n```\r\njournlctl -f -u my-app.service \\\r\n  PRIORITY=1 PRIORITY=2 PRIORITY=3 PRIORITY=4 \\\r\n    SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=only-important-messages-are-shown-now \\\r\n + \\\r\n PRIORITY=1 PRIORITY=2 PRIORITY=3 PRIORITY=4 PRIORITY=5 PRIORITY=6 PRIORITY=7 \\\r\n    SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=I-want-details-from-this\r\n```\r\nThat command will follow journal stream from the `my-app.service`. The logger whose name is `only-important-messages-are-shown-now` is rather heavily filtered, but everything from a logger called `I-want-details-from-this` is shown. These options are [documented](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journalctl.html) in `journalctl`'s manpage. Sadly, there is neither range-checking nor [negative matching](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/2720) in there.\r\n\r\nI'm doing this mostly for use cases described in #1290 ...\r\n\r\n##  ~~journald: wider range of log severities~~\r\n\r\n~~The previous code made it impossible to distinguish between the `debug` and `trace` severities. So instead of trying hard to preserve the equivalence of `spdlog::level::debug` with `LOG_DEBUG`, which is -- in the end -- just an arbitrary name, make sure that functionality is not lost.~~\r\n\r\n[Removed per explicit request]( https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/pull/1292#discussion_r340777258); here's how to implement this:\r\n```c++\r\n#include <spdlog/sinks/systemd_sink.h>\r\n\r\ntemplate<typename Mutex>\r\nclass journald_sink : public spdlog::sinks::systemd_sink<Mutex> {\r\npublic:\r\n    journald_sink()\r\n    {\r\n        this->syslog_levels_ = {/* spdlog::level::trace      */ LOG_DEBUG,\r\n              /* spdlog::level::debug      */ LOG_INFO,\r\n              /* spdlog::level::info       */ LOG_NOTICE,\r\n              /* spdlog::level::warn       */ LOG_WARNING,\r\n              /* spdlog::level::err        */ LOG_ERR,\r\n              /* spdlog::level::critical   */ LOG_CRIT,\r\n              /* spdlog::level::off        */ LOG_ALERT};\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n##  journald: structured output for logger's name\r\n\r\nPreviously, the logger name was effectively lost. There were two choices on how to add it:\r\n\r\n- Via a formatter, which would mean that `journalctl` would not be able to filter against that. That would be suboptimal.\r\n\r\n- As a \"syslog identifier\". This means that `journalctl` will, by default, stop showing the daemon's executable name and replace that via the logger name. The PID is still shown, and if one would like to go back to the previous behavior, it is still possible via `journalctl -o with-unit`.\r\n\r\nI think that the second option is strictly better than the

are migrating from `file_sink` to `systemd_sink` and we would like to preserve the `spdlog` format. It's dropped (by design, I understand) during conversion because `journald` implements its own structured logging. That makes sense, but we're losing some important fields in the process.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm looking #1289 but using the alternative approach proposed.\r\nThat is, adding a boolean to constructor and re-implement #1107 for `systemd_sink`.\r\n\r\nI understand that I can create my own sink to implement it this way, but I having this feature upstream is of course preferable (avoid duplication and guarantees further updates).\r\n\r\nI can definitely open a Pull Request if you think this is an acceptable addition.\r\n\r\nI have also just one question: `sd_journal_send()` being thread safe, does that mean I can safely use `systemd_sink_st` in a multi-threaded environment with multiple loggers?

again. :)\r\n\r\nI'm still exploring the `systemd_sink` and I'm a little bothered by the use of `logger_name` to complete the `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` field.\r\nIt was introduced by #1289 to ensure logger's name isn't lost. This is absolutely fine, but this isn't useful when `enable_formatter` (#2320) is enabled.\r\nBy default, `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` contains the application name which seems more natural. Using the logger's name as `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` makes it kind if harder to identify the application logs within `journalctl`.\r\nMy main \"problem\" is that by overriding  `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` we can no longer filter logs with `journalctl -t appname`, we have to use `journalctl -f _COMM=appname`. It's a little annoyance, but that makes me feel `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` isn't used properly.\r\n\r\nFor reference, here is a message running `./my_app` without `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` being overridden:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"CODE_FILE\": \"main.cpp\",\r\n\t\"CODE_FUNC\": \"main\",\r\n\t\"CODE_LINE\": \"6\",\r\n\t\"MESSAGE\": \"Hello World!\",\r\n\t\"PRIORITY\": \"6\",\r\n\t\"SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER\": \"my_app\",\r\n\t\"_BOOT_ID\": \"5a72020658b14867a5f011f283647138\",\r\n\t\"_GID\": \"1000\",\r\n\t\"_HOSTNAME\": \"delgan-laptop\",\r\n\t\"_MACHINE_ID\": \"3fcc29c834cf4bdeb22dfd1340a789f6\",\r\n\t\"_PID\": \"393259\",\r\n\t\"_SOURCE_REALTIME_TIMESTAMP\": \"1648374364807251\",\r\n\t\"_TRANSPORT\": \"journal\",\r\n\t\"_UID\": \"1000\",\r\n\t\"__CURSOR\": \"s=cf394ceea1a04b3bbff567538c6a8070;i=3c72a;b=5a72020658b14867a5f011f283647138;m=1038984c36;t=5db301078a0a5;x=c9adb40b0832588b\",\r\n\t\"__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP\": \"69668981814\",\r\n\t\"__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP\": \"1648374364807333\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is the same message with `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=my_logger`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"CODE_FILE\": \"main.cpp\",\r\n\t\"CODE_FUNC\": \"main\",\r\n\t\"CODE_LINE\": \"6\",\r\n\t\"MESSAGE\": \"Hello World!\",\r\n\t\"PRIORITY\": \"6\",\r\n\t\"SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER\": \"my_logger\",\r\n\t\"_BOOT_ID\": \"5a72020658b14867a5f011f283647138\",\r\n\t\"_COMM\": \"my_app\",\r\n\t\"_GID\": \"1000\",\r\n\t\"_HOSTNAME\": \"delgan-laptop\",\r\n\t\"_MACHINE_ID\": \"3fcc29c834cf4bdeb22dfd1340a789f6\",\r\n\t\"_PID\": \"393265\",\r\n\t\"_SOURCE_REALTIME_TIMESTAMP\": \"1648374366820985\",\r\n\t\"_TRANSPORT\": \"journal\",\r\n\t\"_UID\": \"1000\",\r\n\t\"__CURSOR\": \"s=cf394ceea1a04b3bbff567538c6a8070;i=3c72c;b=5a72020658b14867a5f011f283647138;m=1038b7065a;t=5db3010975aca;x=9e960f3f99fad8a6\",\r\n\t\"__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP\": \"69670995546\",\r\n\t\"__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP\": \"1648374366821066\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have been thinking of the following possibilities:\r\n- Add a new `bool` argument to `systemd_sink` to disable `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` overriding. The implementation may require adding nested `if` and repeating `sd_journal_send` calls which isn't very elegant.\r\n- Add a new `std:string ident` argument similar to `syslog_sink`. If it's not empty, use it to override `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` otherwise use logger's name.\r\n- Do nothing and keep it as it is. I'm still in an exploratory phase and I'm not sure I'll use `systemd_sink` in the end, so if you want to avoid adding complexity, that's perfectly acceptable and I'll find another solution anyway.\r\n\r\nLet me know what's your opinion on this, and if you think it's worth implementing something, I'll open a PR. :+1: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/2323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/2323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8099439283,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAY1ReM4epaI9zwAAAAHiw6Kz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/events/8099439283","actor":{"login":"bachittle","id":39804642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODA0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39804642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle","html_url":"https://github.com/bachittle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bachittle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"91b05720ef38bcd065e1ebb8c9c857764d8d0e3b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bachittle/spdlog/commits/91b05720ef38bcd065e1ebb8c9c857764d8d0e3b","created_at":"2022-12-22T21:57:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
