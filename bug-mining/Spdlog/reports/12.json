When the thread is sleeping and the system clock is changed to a previous time, the sleep takes longer than expected, apparently by as much as the system clock was changed.\r\n\r\nThe bug easily reproduces with this snippet:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include \"stdafx.h\"\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <chrono>\r\n#include <thread>\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\twhile (true) {\r\n\t\tstd::cout << \"sleeping for 500ms\" << std::endl;\r\n\t\tstd::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimply go back in time and one of the 500ms `sleep_for` calls will take much longer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI found a comment in [here](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/61684/stdthis-threadsleep-for-depends-on-system-time.html) which indicates that `sleep_until` doesn't have the same issue, though I don't really verify that. I tried using both `system_clock` and `steady_clock` to compute the `sleep_until` argument; the bug still happens.\r\n\r\nOf course, using the WinAPI call `Sleep` works like a charm.\r\n\r\nWould you accept a PR in which I replace `sleep_for` calls for `Sleep` calls in Windows?","closed_by":{"login":"gabime","id":6052198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6052198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime","html_url":"https://github.com/gabime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/609/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gabime/spdlog/issues/609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
