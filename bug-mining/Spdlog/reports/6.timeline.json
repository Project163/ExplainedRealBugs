got a several-year old installation of Arch, and I'm trying to\r\ncompile RapMap to benchmark against some other aligners with in \r\nsilico tests. I'm assessing accuracy and recall as\r\n\"alignment/mapping overlaps origin of read\" and \"`bedtools subtract`\".\r\n\r\nAnyways, so to try and compile the 0.5 release of RapMap you linked\r\n[here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap/releases/tag/v0.5.0), I've got some errors.\r\n\r\n`gcc -v` is\r\n\r\n    Using built-in specs.\r\n    COLLECT_GCC=/usr/bin/gcc\r\n    COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/6.3.1/lto-wrapper\r\n    Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\r\n    Configured with: /build/gcc-multilib/src/gcc/configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib --libexecdir=/usr/lib --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info --with-bugurl=https://bugs.archlinux.org/ --enable-languages=c,c++,ada,fortran,go,lto,objc,obj-c++ --enable-shared --enable-threads=posix --enable-libmpx --with-system-zlib --with-isl --enable-__cxa_atexit --disable-libunwind-exceptions --enable-clocale=gnu --disable-libstdcxx-pch --disable-libssp --enable-gnu-unique-object --enable-linker-build-id --enable-lto --enable-plugin --enable-install-libiberty --with-linker-hash-style=gnu --enable-gnu-indirect-function --enable-multilib --disable-werror --enable-checking=release\r\n    Thread model: posix\r\n    gcc version 6.3.1 20170306 (GCC)\r\n\r\n`clang -v` is\r\n\r\n    clang version 3.9.1 (tags/RELEASE_391/final)\r\n    Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\n    Thread model: posix\r\n    InstalledDir: /usr/bin\r\n    Found candidate GCC installation: /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/6.3.1\r\n    Found candidate GCC installation: /usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/6.3.1\r\n    Found candidate GCC installation: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/6.3.1\r\n    Found candidate GCC installation: /usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/6.3.1\r\n    Selected GCC installation: /usr/bin/../lib64/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/6.3.1\r\n    Candidate multilib: .;@m64\r\n    Candidate multilib: 32;@m32\r\n    Selected multilib: .;@m64\r\n    clang-3.9: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-fPIE'\r\n    clang-3.9: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pie'\r\n    clang-3.9: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-fstack-check'\r\n    clang-3.9: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-fstack-protector-strong'\r\n\r\n`cmake -V` is 3.7.2\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`mkdir build && cd build` of course works fine\r\n\r\n`cmake ..` works fine, reports that it couldn't find Cereal or \r\nJellyfish and will fetch and build both.\r\n\r\n`make` reports errors and warnings.
