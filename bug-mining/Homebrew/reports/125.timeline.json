OK, thanks for the follow-up, I was unsure, because the way you worded it made it seem like `brew tap --force-auto-update` was already removed, but yeah running it still does something (or at least doesn't cause an error) in Homebrew `4.5.0-101-g2af5eab`\n\nMy two cents on whether it's ok to just delete it is this: from the perspective of a new user like me, it's really confusing to have a feature that does nothing. It would be also jarring if it just threw a warning, because it's weird to have a function that is useless except to generate that warning. So I'd say it's ok to delete without any deprecation
