\r\n\r\n- [ ] The `brew doctor` above contains no \"Warning\" lines.\r\n\r\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\r\n\r\nI ran `brew update` and `brew upgrade` where Homebrew noticed that the cleanup hasn't been run in the last 30 days, so it started the cleanup and quits with the error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Permission denied @ apply2files - /usr/local/lib/prey/versions/1.9.9/.DS_Store\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened (include all command output)?\r\n\r\nI ran `brew update` and `brew upgrade`, when brew started a cleanup, which stops with an error (see above)\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI expected the cleanup to run through without any errors, especially because Prey has not been installed via Homebrew but via a macOS package. I guess both use the same path, hence Homebrew claims it and wants to clean it.\r\n\r\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbrew cleanup\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/10988/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/10988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
