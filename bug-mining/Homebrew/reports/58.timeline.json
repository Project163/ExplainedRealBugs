Thanks!\r\n\r\nWarning: Some installed kegs have no formulae!\r\nThis means they were either deleted or installed manually.\r\nYou should find replacements for the following formulae:\r\n  pycparser\r\n  erdtree\r\n  trurl\r\n  szip\r\n\r\nWarning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar.\r\nLeaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause formulae that depend on\r\nthose kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:\r\n  tcl-tk\r\n  python@3.11\n```\n\n\n### Verification\n\n- [X] My \"`brew doctor` output\" above says `Your system is ready to brew.` and am still able to reproduce my issue.\n- [X] I ran `brew update` twice and am still able to reproduce my issue.\n- [X] This issue's title and/or description do not reference a single formula e.g. `brew install wget`.
