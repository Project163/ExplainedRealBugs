If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nFiling this for myself to implement once I have a moment 🙂 \n\nTL;DR: I'd like to add a `strict` kwarg to `check_for_duplicate_pull_requests` that restores the \"fail hard\" behavior. This kwarg will be `false` by default to make it compatible with the current behavior, while consumers like `brew-pip-audit` can set it to `true` to restore their previous API expectations.\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\n`check_for_duplicate_pull_requests` provides the duplicate PR checking functionality for a bunch of dev commands, as well as for `brew-pip-audit`.\n\nStarting with https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/18206, the behavior of `check_for_duplicate_pull_requests` changed slightly: before it would fail hard (with an exit) if a duplicate existed, and after it only fails hard if being run on an official tap and the `version` kwarg is present. In all other cases, the duplicate check now fails \"softly\" by emitting a warning.\n\nThis works well for the common use case (deduplicating version bump PRs), but it unfortunately means that `brew-pip-audit` now creates duplicate PRs some of the time, e.g. https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/221601 and https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/221607.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nThis will make `brew-pip-audit` less noisy (like it was before), which in turn will reduce maintainer load/manual work when triaging `brew-pip-audit` PRs.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nAlternatives:\n\n1. Do nothing and keep submitting duplicate PRs. This seems non-ideal in terms of noise/maintainer overhead, but we could do it.\n2. Refactor `check_for_duplicate_pull_requests` more broadly to be a \"pure\" API, i.e. use exceptions and return types to signal its status instead of emitting warnings and failing directly. This is probably conceptually cleaner, but it requires a more intensive set of changes (e.g. within all of the consuming `dev-cmds`) and would have larger external API compat implications. However, if people prefer this route, I can go this way instead 🙂 \n\nCC @alex","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19828/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
