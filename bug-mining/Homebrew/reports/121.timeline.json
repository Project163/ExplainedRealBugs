Enhancing this code does absolutely nothing if the executable doesn't know how to generate PowerShell completions, and I'm guessing very few projects even care to do this.\n\nNow I'm not a Homebrew maintainer, but I'm pretty sure enabling PowerShell completions _at all_ has to start with:\n1. deciding where all PowerShell completion code should go (let's say `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/pwsh-completions` for consistency with the other shells)\n1. updating https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion to tell users how to configure their PowerShells to look in this directory\n\nBut all that's in vain if upstreams don't know how to generate PowerShell completion code for their projects. If PowerShell could somehow understand and reuse existing completion code for other shells, then we're off to the races. If not, this would be more like a false start.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2692539836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gromgit","id":215702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/215702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit","html_url":"https://github.com/gromgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2692804834","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19403#issuecomment-2692804834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19403","id":2692804834,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6ggPDi","user":{"login":"heaths","id":1532486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths","html_url":"https://github.com/heaths","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heaths/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-02T16:29:27Z","updated_at":"2025-03-02T16:31:14Z","body":"Of course, and many executables do.

Q: the shell executable is called `pwsh` but the name and config files use \"powershell\" e.g., `~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell.Profile.ps1`. Should I call the completions directory \"powershell_completions\" or \"pwsh_completions\"? Leaning toward the latter, but it gets weird because both cobra and clap use \"{app} completion powershell\". I could - though I'm leaning toward not - trying first \"powershell\" and \"pwsh\" if the former fails, but so far haven't found any examples that use \"completion(s) pwsh\".\n\nFWIW, we don't need to handle a process named `powershell` (not unless someone compiled their own to a different name 🤷‍♂️) because that's *Windows* PowerShell, which is

Verification\n\n- [x] This issue's title and/or description do not reference a single formula e.g. `brew install wget`. If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nJust as `fish`, `zsh`, `bash` and `powershell` have code in `brew` to support formulae and casks to ship them, so should `nushell`.\n\nI don't know much about homebrew, but https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19407 looks simple enough and I've done similar work in https://github.com/chimera-linux/cports/pull/2504 and also implemented parts of the autoload feature in nushell (https://github.com/nushell/nushell/pull/13382), that is used for shell completions by distributions. If this has a chance to get merged, I'd work on this.\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nI'm using nushell on both my work laptop, running MacOS and Homebrew, and my private laptop, running Chimera Linux.\n\nA bunch of tools have code to generate nushell completions, and other distributions are shipping nushell completions with their packages. Homebrew does not so far, seriously impacting the usability of nushell as a shell.\n\nIn general, the support for completions on nushell is fairly limited, but knowing that completions exist and they just aren't available is pretty frustrating.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nIt won't. But the equivalent thing on the powershell side also wasn't relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nNot doing this. I don't like that alternative though :P","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/20956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/20956/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
