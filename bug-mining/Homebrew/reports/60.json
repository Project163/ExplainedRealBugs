If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\r\n\r\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\r\n\r\n`brew shellenv` does not currently accept a shell name parameter to override its default output, based on the output `/bin/ps`. The `ps` approach seems best for *most* initialization and interactive use cases, but for some advanced use cases, it would be desirable to be able to explicitly choose which shell information is displayed, like:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ brew shellenv zsh\r\nexport HOMEBREW_PREFIX=\"…\"\r\n…\r\n$ brew shellenv fish\r\nset -gx HOMEBREW_PREFIX=\"…\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\r\n\r\nAn interesting caching technique was discussed in [twpayne/chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/discussions/2971) that could see someone writing a template that calls `{{ output \"brew\" \"shellenv\" | trim }}` in a template to capture that information. If they (like me) are running under fish, but keep some bash and/or zsh scripts with this caching, then the output of `brew shellenv` will be fish-specific and not zsh-specific.\r\n\r\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\r\n\r\nIt will not be. It will be invisible to most users since it should have no impact for the 98% use case.\r\n\r\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\r\n\r\nThere are no alternatives because of the specificity of the call to `/bin/ps`.\r\n\r\nI am willing to open a PR for this since the audience is narrow. The changes would be:\r\n\r\n1. `Library/Homebrew/cmd/shellenv.sh:20` needs to read to read `$1` *or* use the output of `ps` if not provided (`\"${1:-$(/bin/ps -p \"${PPID}\" -c -o comm=)}\"`)\r\n2. `Library/Homebrew/cmd/shellenv.sh:1–7` would need to be updated to show the additional optional parameter and document its use.\r\n3. `Library/Homebrew/brew.sh:84` may need to pass \"$1\" or \"$@\". (Local testing suggests that \"$1\" is being inherited in some way.)\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git Library/Homebrew/cmd/shellenv.sh Library/Homebrew/cmd/shellenv.sh\r\nindex a19a2223d520..6ffac2a599a5 100644\r\n--- Library/Homebrew/cmd/shellenv.sh\r\n+++ Library/Homebrew/cmd/shellenv.sh\r\n@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@\r\n-#:  * `shellenv`\r\n+#:  * `shellenv [bash|csh|fish|pwsh|sh|tcsh|zsh]`\r\n #:\r\n #:  Print export statements.
