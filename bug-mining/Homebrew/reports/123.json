When those checks are run, but with `check_user_path_1` listed before, they pass. If `check_user_path_2` or `check_user_path_3` occur _before_ `check_user_path_1` then a warning is issued.\n\n\n### What happened (include all command output)?\n\n```\nPlease note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers\nwith debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is\nworking fine: please don't worry or file an issue; just ignore this.
