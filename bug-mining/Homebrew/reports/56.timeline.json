Essentially the cat command is failing because those files don't exist locally anymore.\r\n\r\nIf you want to look at the source for a package, you need to either tap the about mentioned main taps again or you can use the `brew info --github` command to open the source in your browser.\r\n\r\nLonger term I think that messaging for this command could be improved.

Verification\n\n- [X] This issue's title and/or description do not reference a single formula e.g. `brew install wget`. If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nThe formula way to handle downloads is fully fleshed out with progress information and the cask system is not. The stage where the download occurs is also different. It's worth consolidating the two.\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\n* Improved UX for cask source downloads\r\n* More common shared code (better maintainability)\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nThe UX for cask source downloads is poor in that there is no progress information and it happens too regularly. Fixing that will provide a better experience.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nKeep it separate and just modify the cask side for feature parity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8940478957,"node_id":"LE_lADOAyxcHc5fXD-1zwAAAAIU5OHt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/8940478957","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-06T00:06:04Z","label":{"name":"outdated","color":"d93f0b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8940479038,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAyxcHc5fXD-1zwAAAAIU5OI-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/8940479038","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-06T00:06:05Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
