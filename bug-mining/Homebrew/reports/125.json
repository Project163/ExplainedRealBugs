If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nThe `brew tap --force-auto-update` function has been removed since March 2024 (Brew 4.2.13, https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/commit/9ac31827a0eaecc8458b36c9d3c24d9e60002ae8). The documentation in `docs/Taps.md` seems outdated.\n\nProposal:\n- Remove the sentence from docs/Taps.md\n- Remove the `--force-auto-update` option from `brew tap`\n- Remove the `force_auto_update` option from bundles (Brewfile). This was already removed from the README in 5f29ab8c89cfe4957b388fcbcb7f14589c6d814e. There only seems to be a single user on GitHub: https://github.com/search?q=%22force_auto_update%3A+true%22+AND+path%3ABrewfile+AND+NOT+%22https%3A%2F%2Fuser%40bitbucket.org%2Fuser%2Fhomebrew-tap-repo.git%22&type=code\n\nOpen question: can we just remove these options without any deprecation cycle? I think that it would be rather educational for the command to fail hard rather than silently accepting the option?\n\nBased on brew 4.5.0, but current master looks similar:\n```\n$ git grep -niEe 'force.?auto.?update'\nLibrary/Homebrew/bundle/tap_installer.rb:22:        args.append(\"--force-auto-update\") if options[:force_auto_update]\nLibrary/Homebrew/cmd/tap.rb:36:        switch \"--[no-]force-auto-update\",\nLibrary/Homebrew/sorbet/rbi/dsl/homebrew/cmd/tap_cmd.rbi:27:  def force_auto_update?; end\nLibrary/Homebrew/tap.rb:478:      config.delete(:forceautoupdate)\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/dsl_spec.rb:18:        tap 'auto/update', 'https://bitbucket.org/auto/update.git', force_auto_update: true\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/dsl_spec.rb:45:        force_auto_update: true,\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/tap_installer_spec.rb:59:    context \"with force_auto_update\" do\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/tap_installer_spec.rb:62:                                                          \"--force-auto-update\",\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/tap_installer_spec.rb:65:        expect(described_class.preinstall(\"homebrew/cask\", force_auto_update: true)).to be(true)\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/tap_installer_spec.rb:66:        expect(described_class.install(\"homebrew/cask\", force_auto_update: true)).to be(true)\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/tap_installer_spec.rb:71:                                                          \"--force-auto-update\",\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/tap_installer_spec.rb:74:        expect(described_class.preinstall(\"homebrew/cask\", force_auto_update: true)).to be(true)\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/bundle/tap_installer_spec.rb:75:        expect(described_class.install(\"homebrew/cask\", force_auto_update: true)).to be(false)\nLibrary/Homebrew/test/cmd/tap_spec.rb:12:    expect { brew \"tap\", \"--force-auto-update\", \"homebrew/bar\", path/\".git\" }\n```\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nWe had some outdated documentation on using a tap that mentioned this option. To reduce any confusion on the purpose of this option, let's remove it or improve the documentation.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nRemoving the option simplifies the documentation and reduces a source of confusion. It will likely not be relevant to the majority of Homebrew users.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nAdd a warning when this option is in use.","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
