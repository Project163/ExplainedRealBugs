If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nIt would be great to add PowerShell completion support. I see from <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/0e1d94506837ff39def056eaa365fa4d6aa07ca8/Library/Homebrew/formula.rb#L2097> that it's not currently supported. While the [best way](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/issues/17283) to do it isn't yet supported - and may never be - there are some possibilities like conditionally adding a `$profile` (default is easy to compute) or, if it exists, conditionally append some lines to `$profile` to check the homebrew library directory for pwsh completions.\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nI use a lot of bash and PowerShell, and having completions in bash is nice but I miss them in PowerShell.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nFor those who use PowerShell as their shell, this would benefit them all. I doubt that's 90% of homebrew users and probably a far cry from the other shells, but I'm sure the other shells probably don't have 90% either. Well, maybe bash. But given zsh is the default shell in macOS for a while, perhaps not.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nI could do the work in a formula that would do this, but I thought it would make sense to update the existing function that all formula can use to support it. I'd be happy to contribute as well.","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
