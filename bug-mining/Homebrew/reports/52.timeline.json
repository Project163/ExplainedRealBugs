If you then insert one empty line after the `__END__` marker, it says that there is an empty preflight block.  If there are three empty lines after the `__END__` marker, then it prints:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ /tmp/testcase \r\npreflight (Preflight Block)\r\n        raise CaskUnavailableError.new(token, \"'#{path}' does not exist.\")  unless path.exist?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat code came from `cask/cask_loader.rb`, line 69, and not from gimp's preflight block as expected.\r\n\r\nTo be precise, if the `preflight` block is at line _p_ of the cask definition, then this test case will print a code expression excerpted from `cask/cask_loader.rb` starting at line <code>42 + _p_ - 1</code>.  Note that line 42 of `cask/cask_loader.rb` is where it calls\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n        instance_eval(content, __FILE__, __LINE__)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUltimately, the problem is that the `method_source` 1.0.0 gem is unable to extract source code that is not loaded from a file.\r\n\r\n1. In `Cask#artifacts_list`, it calls `Artifact::AbstractFlightBlock#to_h`\r\n2. `Artifact::AbstractFlightBlock#to_h` is:\r\n\r\n   ```ruby\r\n      def to_h\r\n        require \"method_source\"\r\n\r\n        directives.transform_values(&:source)\r\n      end\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\n3. In `method_source.rb`, `#source` calls `MethodSource.source_helper`:\r\n\r\n   ```ruby\r\n    def source\r\n      MethodSource.source_helper(source_location, defined?(name) ? name : inspect)\r\n    end\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. `MethodSource.source_helper` is defined as:\r\n\r\n    ```ruby\r\n      # Helper method responsible for extracting method body.\r\n      # Defined here to avoid polluting `Method` class.\r\n      # @param [Array] source_location The array returned by Method#source_location\r\n      # @param [String]  method_name\r\n      # @return [String] The method body\r\n      def self.source_helper(source_location, name=nil)\r\n        raise SourceNotFoundError, \"Could not locate source for #{name}!\" unless source_location\r\n        file, line = *source_location\r\n    \r\n        expression_at(lines_for(file), line)\r\n      rescue SyntaxError => e\r\n        raise SourceNotFoundError, \"Could not parse source for #{name}: #{e.message}\"\r\n      end\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThere is no way that `expression_at(lines_for(file), …)` can work, when the code was evaluated from a string and not a file.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1420626868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dpoon","id":260080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon","html_url":"https://github.com/dpoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1420633971","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/14541#issuecomment-1420633971","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14541","id":1420633971,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc5UrSdz","user":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-07T11:38:41Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T11:38:41Z","body":"Thanks

This is consistent with the way things work with `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API`.\r\n\r\nAlso, while we're at it, let's fully remove the bottle API. It's already been removed from formulae.brew.sh and the `--bottle` switch to turn it on was hidden.

They are just there to indicate there presence and nothing more.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The JSON generation using casks loaded from the API doesn't return the desired results but the removal of the flight block source in JSON is still ready to go.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14611/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8713522473,"node_id":"LE_lADOAyxcHc5d01GOzwAAAAIHXc0p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/8713522473","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-10T00:07:13Z","label":{"name":"outdated","color":"d93f0b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8713522552,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAyxcHc5d01GOzwAAAAIHXc14","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/8713522552","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-10T00:07:14Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
