If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nThere [should be a simple way to get a list of all the things one installed intentionally (as opposed to auto installed as a dependency)](https://stackoverflow.com/q/69994716/8910547).\r\n\r\nAs I state in my StackOverflow answer to the above linked question:\r\n\r\n\r\n> If you just want the short list of what you specifically installed, `brew leaves ‑r` will work for *most* cases:\r\n> \r\n> ``` bash\r\n> > brew leaves -r\r\n> \r\n> git\r\n> less\r\n> node\r\n> sqlite\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> `brew leaves` lists things installed that aren't dependencies (leaves in the above tree), and the `‑r` filters the list to those thing you specifically *`r`equested*.\r\n> \r\n> I said \"most cases\" because it won't include things that you installed manually but are no longer leaves. This happens when you install another thing that depends on something you originally installed manually. For example, if I had installed `readline` manually, `brew leaves ‑r` would show it at first, but not after I install `node` or `sqlite`.\r\n> \r\n> For a lot of people, \"leaf\" and \"installed manually\" will be the same thing. But the more you install the more likely this will be wrong.\r\n\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nBoth `brew update` and `brew outdated` list everything installed that is outdated. But I only want to consider updating packages that I specifically installed, and leave decisions about updating dependencies to the packages that depend on them. I can't remember which things are which.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nFor the same reasons `brew list`, `brew deps`, `brew uses --installed`, `brew leaves` and `brew leaves -r` are relevant: Users want to understand what is installed, and why it is installed. But none of the aforementioned commands answer the question, \"What are all the things that ***I*** installed?\", the answer to which is important per my motivation above, and probably for many other motivations.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nAs noted in [my StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69994717/8910547) the desired list can be achieved via the unintuitive and complex `brew bundle dump --file -`. I would never have figured this out without lots of research and searches, which prompted me to write both the Stack Overflow question and my increasingly popular answer.","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/17117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/17117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
