#13883.\r\n\r\nThis broke in e8f2d8f6c5b8d53075b7500ba26ccaae79a7bcd1 in a non-obvious way. `CoreTap.instance.alias_dir/ref` where `ref` is an absolute path will just return `ref` itself, but after that commit meant it was lowercased which breaks on case-sensitive systems.\r\n\r\nI've tweaked the code to explicitly check if we are using an absolute path `ref` to make the code not rely on weird side effects like that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7410001038,"node_id":"CE_lADOAyxcHc5SEnFvzwAAAAG5q6SO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/7410001038","actor":{"login":"Bo98","id":1190754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA3NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1190754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98","html_url":"https://github.com/Bo98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-19T02:29:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7626104692,"node_id":"LE_lADOAyxcHc5SEnFvzwAAAAHGjR90","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/7626104692","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T00:12:37Z","label":{"name":"outdated","color":"d93f0b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7626104737,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAyxcHc5SEnFvzwAAAAHGjR-h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/7626104737","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-20T00:12:38Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
