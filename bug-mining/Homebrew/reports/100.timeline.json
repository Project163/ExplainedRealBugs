https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue and found no duplicates.\r\n\r\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\r\n\r\nI was using an internal Keg to install a cli tool written in Ruby script which used a shebang like this:\r\n\r\nContrived example **/opt/homebrew/bin/my_cool_cli**\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\r\nputs \"I am a very useful cli tool written in Ruby\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What happened (include all command output)?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ my_cool_cli\r\nrbenv: version `3.3.2' is not installed (set by /opt/homebrew/.ruby-version)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI expected that `my_cool_cli` would pick up my global ruby version\r\n\r\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ brew tap private-org/private-tap \r\n$ brew install private-org/private-tap/my-cool-cli\r\n$ my_cool_cli\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/173816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/173816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2151289263","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/17390#issuecomment-2151289263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/17390","id":2151289263,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6AOhGv","user":{"login":"carlocab","id":30379873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzc5ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30379873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab","html_url":"https://github.com/carlocab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-06T02:12:19Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T02:12:19Z","body":"Related:

said:\r\n> I see many potential solutions including not using `rbenv` in this case\r\n\r\nFor clarification, I'm not using `rbenv` for these scripts. But I do have projects that use `rbenv`, so I install it for those. I keep `rbenv global` tied to `system`, and only use `.ruby-version` in project directories. The only way to avoid this issue is to not use `rbenv` at all, which is not really viable. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I *think* I can use [`direnv` + `use rbenv`](https://direnv.net/man/direnv-stdlib.1.html#codeuse-rbenvcode) to conditionally hook `rbenv` into my shell, but I haven't gotten around to trying that, yet, and would require me to use it for every project that used `rbenv`.\r\n\r\n> installing the relevant Ruby version Homebrew wants\r\n\r\nYes, but now I am at the whim of whatever version Homebrew is using. Since I opened this issue, `.ruby-version` in Homebrew has already changed from `3.3.1` to `3.3.2`. Now every time I run `brew update`, these scripts could potentially break if `.ruby-version` happens to bump, until I install whatever version Homebrew wants.\r\n\r\n@reitermarkus: That pattern would unfortunately not work well for my tap. FWIW, my tap is just a single directory with a bunch of relatively small single-file scripts in it. Some are Ruby, some are Python, and some are Perl. They all use `#!/usr/bin/env whatever` and they all are only dependent on their respective standard libraries. The `install` step is just a simple `Makefile` which copies all the scripts into `#{prefix}/bin/`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  def install\r\n    system \"make\", \"install\", \"PREFIX=#{prefix}\"\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `libexec.install` + `write_env_script` would mean making this installation a lot more complicated. It would need to enumerate only the Ruby scripts somehow so they can be installed into `libexec` and then stubs added to `bin`.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, I'm not trying to be difficult, but just pointing out how inconvenient this change is.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2152591577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ddribin","id":20428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin","html_url":"https://github.com/ddribin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddribin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13067176123,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAyxcHc6KkCmWzwAAAAMK3Ui7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/13067176123","actor":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-06T13:51:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13067176130,"node_id":"SE_lADOAyxcHc6KkCmWzwAAAAMK3UjC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/13067176130","actor":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-06T13:51:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13067176156,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAyxcHc6KkCmWzwAAAAMK3Ujc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/13067176156","actor":{"login":"reitermarkus","id":1309829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1309829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus","html_url":"https://github.com/reitermarkus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reitermarkus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-06T13:51:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13067176170,"node_id":"SE_lADOAyxcHc6KkCmWzwAAAAMK3Ujq","url
