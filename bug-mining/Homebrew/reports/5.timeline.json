It is already set up to default to `HOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DEFAULT_DOMAIN`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this won't do anything to help those who are updating from old versions, since the env is set prior to the update.

The version of Homebrew on Circle CI images is outdated (2.2.2 from over a year ago) and has an issue that prevents the correct auto-update, necessary for fetching OpenJDK from the correct mirror and thus avoiding Bintray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkflows using this Orb [are failing](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/920/workflows/01517e8d-fea5-499c-943a-c331c7f54ca3/jobs/7995/steps) because of an OpenJDK dependency from Bintray:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install sbt\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/openjdk-15.0.2.catalina.bottle.tar.\r\n##O#- #

has already been removed from the OpenJDK formula:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/d9511650b68d88543a82e953f09228bd68c73fd4\r\n\r\nI found out that more people had a similar issue when installing Homebrew packages, and because of an issue on the very old Homebrew version present in Circle CI images, for now the solution is to run `brew update` before installing a package:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/11123","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codacy/codacy-orbs/issues/146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codacy/codacy-orbs/issues/146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cameel","id":137030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel","html_url":"https://github.com/cameel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cameel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-19T14:04:38Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T14:04:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/argotorg/solidity/issues/11267","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/argotorg/solidity","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/argotorg/solidity/issues/11267/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/argotorg/solidity/issues/11267/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/argotorg/solidity/issues/11267/events","html_url":"https://github.com/argotorg/solidity/pull/11267","id":861165746,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjE3ODc2NTE5","number":11267,"title":"Force
