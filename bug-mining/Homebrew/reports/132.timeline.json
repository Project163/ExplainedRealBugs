If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nWhen resolving https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/discussions/5920 I came to think that the error messaging could be improved when `ulimit -f` is hit. Right now you get something like this:\n```\neliot@mac ~ % brew doctor \n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/portable-ruby/portable-ruby/blobs/sha256:d9faa506c014dedc0b034a68103ba75c9a58242f4d6c67b6ca0f649c39602bcf\n###########################################################################################                                                                                                                    44.6%/opt/homebrew/Library/Homebrew/utils/helpers.sh: line 70: 10650 Filesize limit exceeded: 25   \"${HOMEBREW_LIBRARY}/Homebrew/shims/shared/curl\" \"$@\"\nError: Checksum mismatch.\nExpected: d9faa506c014dedc0b034a68103ba75c9a58242f4d6c67b6ca0f649c39602bcf\n  Actual: fccf4d3edba3426330b3cfc0b967e14df421953da2b57796a34253808ee00647\n Archive: /Users/eliot/Library/Caches/Homebrew/portable-ruby-3.3.7.arm64_big_sur.bottle.tar.gz\nTo retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.\n```\n\nWay off to the right of the download line there's a cryptic message about `Filesize limit exceeded` and no suggestion of a possible fix (the fix that is suggested here, deleting the tarball, doesn't work because the file is being truncated when the download is aborted.)\n\nConfounding the problem, it seems on at least some versions of macOS, the default `ulimit -f` in zsh is quite low (5 MiB), virtually guaranteeing that the tarball for `portable-ruby` will fail to install during initial setup. I'm on an M4 Pro MacBook Pro 2024 running macOS 15.2 and ran into this issue during initial installation of homebrew.\n\nI'm proposing that a quick sanity check for `ulimit -f` could be added before attempting to download anything, but especially the initial `portable-ruby` tarball, and log a warning or error if it's likely too low to allow a successful download.\n\nAs long as the server returns a `Content-Length` header it could be retrieved with a preflight request like so and this could feed into the sanity check:\n```\neliot@mac ~ % curl -sI -H \"Authorization: Bearer QQ==\" https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/portable-ruby/portable-ruby/blobs/sha256:d9faa506c014dedc0b034a68103ba75c9a58242f4d6c67b6ca0f649c39602bcf | awk 'tolower($0) ~ /content-length/ { print $2 }'\n11727557\n```\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nMaking it more obvious to the user that they need to raise their `ulimit -f` when it would prevent a successful file download required by homebrew.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nI think it's probably going to become a more commonplace issue. I haven't run into this before on other macs but did on this brand new MacBook running macOS 15.2. It's possible Apple has lowered the default `ulimit -f` in some recent version of macOS making this more likely, or maybe it's being enforced on `curl` now and wasn't before. I don't know why I would have run into this otherwise with a brand new machine.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nIf a code sanity check isn't added it would be good to at least add something prominent to the docs about this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2628040891","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177#issuecomment-2628040891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177","id":2628040891,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6cpLi7","user":{"login":"durka","id":47007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka","html_url":"https://github.com/durka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-31T18:29:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T18:29:07Z","body":"I

Bugs don't go away just because they haven't been fixed in three weeks, quite the opposite in fact!\n\nYou might want to read the article that you keep linking to more carefully...\n\n>> Let me offer you a different way of thinking about issues: a place for motivated users to collaborate on narrowing down the problem and planning a potential fix. A space for the community to work, rather than an action item for you to deal with personally.\n\nThat's only true in very rare cases for Homebrew issues. The vast majority of the time, it's users going \"hey Homebrew, I got this problem, fix it!\", exactly the opposite of Drew's utopian ideal.\n\n>> It’s entirely valid to just ignore your bug tracker entirely and leave it up to users to deal with themselves.\n\nIs that what you want to happen with Homebrew?\n\n---\n\nDrew's ideal sounds nice in principle, but it _doesn't scale_. It's all very well for a project with a single product to say \"hey everyone, I can't/won't address all the issues you post, but I'm sure you're motivated enough to help each other resolve whatever issues crop up, and anyway, there aren't that many\".\n\nHomebrew has over 10,000 \"products\" (formulae and casks), thousands of issues posted to date, and folks tend _not_ to close their issues or even report back that they've been fixed--silence is a frequent response. As for motivating the Homebrew community to help fix things, that rarely happens, even for the focused codebase that is the Homebrew software itself.\n\nUnder such conditions, stalebot is simply the sane way to maintain some level of sanity amongst the handful of folks who're actively maintaining Homebrew. If nothing else, it brings stale issues to attention by popping them back up in everyone's notifications, and if even the OP is no longer interested in pursuing it for whatever reason, it frees up time and attention for other active issues.\n\nIf you have another solution for dealing with issues at scale, the Homebrew maintainers might be interested in hearing about it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2731430338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gromgit","id":215702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/215702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit","html_url":"https://github.com/gromgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2731653028","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177#issuecomment-2731653028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177","id":2731653028,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6i0bek","user":{"login":"durka","id":47007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka","html_url":"https://github.com/durka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-18T05:04:39Z","updated_at":"2025-03-18T05:06:02Z","body":"> You might want to read the article that you keep linking to more carefully...\n\nCondescending and uncalled-for.

There is no shame in having a lot of open issues — if anything, it signals popularity. Don’t deny your users access to an important mutual support resource, and a crucial funnel to bring new contributors into your project.\n\nFrom my perspective, stalebot is a threat. I expended effort to report this issue. I searched for existing issues, found one, created a reproduction, etc. If you look at the first few comments, it was productive discussion where we narrowed down the problem. But nobody picked it up to fix yet. After that, the thread just becomes noise as I'm fighting a robot to keep the issue open.\n\nAs a reward for that contribution, stalebot comes in every three weeks saying \"I would really love to pretend this has been fixed, is that cool?\" It's hostile and unwelcoming. As a result of this, and especially your condescension, I'm probably going to let the issue get closed next time, leaving this papercut that makes Homebrew less useful on ubuntu.\n\nIs that what **you** want to happen with Homebrew?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2731653028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"durka","id":47007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka","html_url":"https://github.com/durka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2731844470","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177#issuecomment-2731844470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177","id":2731844470,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6i1KN2","user":{"login":"gromgit","id":215702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/215702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit","html_url":"https://github.com/gromgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-18T06:40:00Z","updated_at":"2025-03-18T06:41:27Z","body":"OK, first off, I was a bit snarky in the opening, and I'm really sorry about that.\n\nThe rest of it, however, was straight to the point. In particular:\n\n>>> It’s entirely valid to just ignore your bug tracker entirely and leave it up to users to deal with themselves.\n\n>> Is that what you want to happen with Homebrew?\n\n> Obviously not. This technique, where you invent something I never said and then argue against it, is called \"strawmanning\" and generally considered a bad idea!\n\nI asked a serious question about a basic premise of the article you keep posting. Your answer to that question is clearly \"no\", and that's something we can agree on, so let's move on.\n\nAs for the rest, we clearly have different perspectives. I disagree that a long list of unclosed issues encourages the Homebrew community to take an active role in fixing them, especially when the issue that a particular person who has the domain knowledge to fix is buried somewhere in page 10 or later of the issues list, after a long list of issues that _were_ fixed but were not closed for whatever reason. Yes, unfixed issues don't magically fix themselves after closing, but drowning maintainers in a sea of unclosed issues isn't workable either.\n\nStalebot might be a bit mechanical, but it _does_ bring two benefits:\n* notifies about issues that fell under everyone's collective radar\n* closes issues that weren't for reasons (user error so nothing to fix, issues that weren't linked to resolving PRs, etc.)\n\nWhat happens to stalebot targets that don't fall into either of the above?\n* Some get regularly renewed by interested parties.\n* Some get auto-closed by stalebot, then someone else comes along months later with new observations/knowledge, and the issue gets reopened by a maintainer and (hopefully) fixed.\n* Some get inadvertently fixed by other changes/refactorings, and either stay dead, or interested parties became (understandably) uninterested, and stalebot closes them after the requisite period.\n\nIt's far from perfect, but no one's suggested a better solution _while considering the overall maintenance burden on Homebrew volunteers_.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2731844470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gromgit","id":215702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/215702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit","html_url":"https://github.com/gromgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2731881009","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177#issuecomment-2731881009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177","id":2731881009,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6i1TIx","user":{"login":"durka","id":47007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka","html_url":"https://github.com/durka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/durka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-18T06:57:04Z","updated_at":"2025-03-18T06:57:47Z","body":"I'm really not interested in arguing about this, sorry.
