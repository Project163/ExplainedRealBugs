My `~/.cshrc` contains the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset noglob\r\neval `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv`\r\nunset noglob\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried creating this shell because I wanted to use the shell to execute other commands.\n\n### What happened (include all command output)?\n\nThe configuration of the tcsh shell encountered an error. The terminal showed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLast login: Sat Aug  3 11:19:12 on ttys006\r\nMANPATH: Undefined variable.\r\n[noir:~] eeide%\r\n```\r\n\r\nTracking this down, I traced the problem to this line in `shellenv.sh`:\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/4dcd308398f17a086d28b79bf363928c1682d923/Library/Homebrew/cmd/shellenv.sh#L35\r\n\r\nWhen executed in a shell in which `MANPATH` is not already set, the shell code output by that line (which is intended to be eval'ed by tcsh) yields an error. This is exemplified by the following tcsh transcript:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[noir:~] eeide% unsetenv MANPATH\r\n[noir:~] eeide% if ( ${?MANPATH} == 1 ) setenv MANPATH :${MANPATH};\r\nMANPATH: Undefined variable.\r\n```\r\n\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI expected no error to be caused by the code that is output by `brew shellenv`.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I expected that there would not be an error relating the setting of `MANPATH` when I created a login shell with tcsh.\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\n\n```shell\n* Start a `tcsh` shell.\r\n* In that shell, execute the following commands. (The setting of `PATH` is required to get `brew shellenv` to output commands.)\r\n\r\n\r\nsetenv PATH /usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/local/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/appleinternal/bin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin\r\nunsetenv MANPATH\r\neval `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv`\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Observe the error output by the last of the above commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% eval `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv`\r\nMANPATH: Undefined variable.\r\n```\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"Bo98","id":1190754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA3NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1190754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98","html_url":"https://github.com/Bo98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bo98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/17949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/17949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
