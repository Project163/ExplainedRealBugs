If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nWhen a developer mode command is issued and developer mode is off (the default), current behavior is to display the developer mode warning once and then enable developer mode.\r\n\r\nBrew should not automatically assume the user wants to enable developer mode and tap homebrew-core or homebrew-cask.\r\n\r\nProposed behavior would require developer mode to be explicitly enabled by setting HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER or running 'brew developer on'.  When developer mode is off and a developer mode command is issued brew should simply display the developer mode warning and terminate.\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nSince installation from API was introduced, I've untapped homebrew-core and homebrew-cask since they're no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have contributed to brew in the past, I do not actively develop brew formula.  However, I frequently will use commands like 'brew cat' to look into formula for dependencies, etc.  There are now alternatives like 'brew info --github' but muscle memory persists.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior of automatically enabling developer mode has become quite obnoxious as it results in automatically setting 'brew developer on' and re-tapping homebrew-core or homebrew-cask, requiring me to reset 'brew developer off' every time.  \r\n\r\n\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nDeveloper mode is not relevant for most users simply looking to install a package.\r\n\r\nIt is counterintuitive to automatically enable this mode since it can have adverse effects on the user's installation.\r\n\r\nBecause the developer mode warning is only issued once and developer mode uses HEAD most users will not realize the implications resulting in a different and potentially less-stable experience.\r\n\r\nIn addition, homebrew-core and/or homebrew-cask will no longer be automatically tapped resulting in a large unexpected download.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nI looked for a variable to disable the automatic enabling of developer mode (such as \"HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=disabled\" or \"HOMEBREW_DISABLE_DEVELOPER_MODE=1\" but such configuration is not supported.","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
