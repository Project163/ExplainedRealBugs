Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\r\n\r\nHere are the tasks that need to be completed in order to consider `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` ready for official testing by maintainers and interested users:\r\n\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13795: `brew update` should still update core and cask taps when `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` and `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER` are both set (allowing maintainers to test this and still maintain homebrew/core and homebrew/cask)\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13815: Allow `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER` users to use all dev commands even with `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` set\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/137512: Migrate all casks to use `on_{macos_version}` blocks instead of `if MacOS.version` conditionals\r\n- [x] Remove the small number of `Hardware::CPU` methods that slipped through in formulae and casks\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/14301: Improve the rubocops to catch more cases\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/14304: Update `CaskLoader` to load casks from their JSON API like we do with formulae\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13842: I think it might be a good idea to mark in the `INSTALL_RECEIPT.json` or `.metadata` directory whether the formula/cask was installed from the API in case we run into issues and it's helpful to know how a formula was installed. But, this is a lower priority and might not even be needed at all\r\n- [x] We need to handle download errors of the `formula.json` and `cask.json` files\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/14009\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/13890\r\n- [x] We should have a way to be notified more reliably when formulae.brew.sh updates stop working as expected because this will mean that users can not get updates and will essentially be frozen in an old state. Maybe a bot should open an issue somewhere.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/14384\r\n- [ ] A warning or some sort of message should be shown when installing a formula with a `post_install` block or a cask with a `{pre,post}flight` block so that users know that some things may not work at the moment (or, in the case of formulae, they need to run `brew postinstall <formula>`)\r\n    - See https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/14026#issuecomment-1292266942 for a good solution\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/14412\r\n\r\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\r\n\r\nI'm back at school so my availability over the next several months will be much more limited and less consistent. I'm opening this tracking issue to help monitor progress over time.\r\n\r\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\r\n\r\nEventually, `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_FROM_API` will be the default for everyone.\r\n\r\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\r\n\r\nNone","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13794/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13794/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8439506916,"node_id":"TRE_lADOAyxcHc5dpqzhzwAAAAH3CKfk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/8439506916","actor":{"login":"Rylan12","id":32525609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTI1NjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32525609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12","html_url":"https://github.com/Rylan12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"transferred","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-05T02:10:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8439507453,"node_id":"LE_lADOAyxcHc5dpqzhzwAAAAH3CKn9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/8439507453","actor":{"login":"Rylan12","id":32525609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTI1NjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32525609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12","html_url":"https://github.com/Rylan12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-05T02:11:32Z","label":{"name":"install from api","color":"31CF7B"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1416902207","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/14505#issuecomment-1416902207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/14505","id":1416902207,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc5UdDY_","user":{"login":"Rylan12","id":32525609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTI1NjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32525609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12","html_url":"https://github.com/Rylan12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rylan12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-05T02:12:38Z","updated_at":"2023-02-05T02:12:38Z","body":"Thanks for reporting—this is a bug we're aware of and planning on working on.

Verification\n\n- [X] I understand that [if I ignore these instructions, my issue may be closed without review](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/faq/closing_issues_without_review.md).\n- [X] I have retried my command with `--force`.\n- [X] I ran `brew update-reset && brew update` and retried my command.\n- [X] I ran `brew doctor`, fixed as many issues as possible and retried my command.\n- [X] I have checked the instructions for [reporting bugs](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask#reporting-bugs).\n- [X] I made doubly sure this is not a [checksum does not match](https://docs.brew.sh/Common-Issues#cask---checksum-does-not-match) error.\n\n### Description of issue\n\nInstallation of Microsoft Visual Studio 1.75.0 fails with the error message\r\n\r\n> Error: It seems the symlink source '/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code' is not there.\r\n\r\nThe `code` binary seems to be preset in the downloaded zip\r\n```shell\r\n$ unzip -l VSCode-darwin.zip | grep '/code$'\r\n     1034  02-01-2023 17:20   Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnsure whether it is related, as you can see my `brew config`, the `--app-dir` option is and point to a different path than shown in the error message above.\n\n### Command that failed\n\nbrew install visual-studio-code\n\n### Output of command with `--verbose --debug`\n\n```shell\n$ brew install
