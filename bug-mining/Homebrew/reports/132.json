Sometimes it gets further, then still fails, and a third try is necessary.\n\nNote that is a duplicate of #9120, but I can't reopen that. It was closed saying only 1 person has ever complained, so let me add my voice as a complainant. This doesn't happen *every* time, but it does happen frequently.\n\nFollowing a comment there, I can see that my ulimit is low:\n```\n$ ulimit -Hn\n1048576\n$ ulimit -Sn\n1024\n```\n\nThis is a standard install of Ubuntu 24.04, nothing spooky.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nThe install process should have completed.\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\n\n```shell\n1. `brew install qemu`\n```","closed_by":{"login":"iMichka","id":3406519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3406519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka","html_url":"https://github.com/iMichka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iMichka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
