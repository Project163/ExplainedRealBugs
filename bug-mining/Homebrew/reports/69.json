still able to reproduce my issue.\n- [X] I have resolved all warnings from `brew doctor` and that did not fix my problem.\n- [X] I searched for recent similar issues at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue and found no duplicates.\n\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\n\nInstalling nmap on apple M1 reports\r\n```\r\n==> Caveats\r\nTo use `ndiff`, you must do:\r\n  chmod go-w /usr/local/Cellar\r\n```\r\n\n\n### What happened (include all command output)?\n\n```\r\n$ brew info nmap\r\n==> nmap: stable 7.94 (bottled), HEAD\r\nPort scanning utility for large networks\r\nhttps://nmap.org/\r\nConflicts with:\r\n  cern-ndiff (because both install `ndiff` binaries)\r\n  ndiff (because both install `ndiff`

unevaluated  `$(brew --prefix)/Cellar`. Seems `HOMEBREW_CELLAR` is already expanded in https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula/nmap.json (never gets evaluated locally)\r\n\r\nAlso why does the formula require chmod change for the root folder `$HOMEBREW_CELLAR` ? - that doesn't seem right or at least why not just `Cellar/<formula>`? - which on my machine it is already `0755` . The change in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/133176 didn't make this clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\n\n```shell\n`brew install nmap`\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15668/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
