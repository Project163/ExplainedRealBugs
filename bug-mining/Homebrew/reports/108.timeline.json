Wonder if this is related to changes from #18278.\r\n\r\nThis regression is new for `brew fetch` (it should fallback to source but that fallback is currently broken).\r\n\r\nIt is however not new for `brew install`. That regressed in https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/commit/9fcdaa2b857d16821a2c8fd710a5ccb5fd3620ae. I tested this by `git checkout` an older 4.3.x.\r\n\r\nThe overall `actionlint` failing is a regression after adding `actionlint` to `brew style` (https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/commit/7d0ac4dd4b7bbf5dd2e6476f37a8009adee2536e) - this is the first time there's been an upgrade to `actionlint` since (1.7.1 was technically after that merge but that's because `brew style homebrew/core` was actually completely broken until #17482). `shellcheck` is probably affected too since `actionlint` pulls that in, though that hasn't been updated in even longer.\r\n\r\nNote that for Homebrew/core we already have https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/.github/workflows/actionlint.yml so maybe the easiest option is to disable `brew style`'s `actionlint` check for Homebrew/core CI specifically. Alternatively if we rather delete that workflow instead, we could force the tap syntax check to `brew install` from the API.
