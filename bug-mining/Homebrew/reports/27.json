unavailable: No Cask with this name exists.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verification\r\n\r\n- [X] I ran `brew update` and am still able to reproduce my issue.\r\n- [X] I have resolved all warnings from `brew doctor` and that did not fix my problem.\r\n\r\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\r\n\r\nReproduce https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/71221#issuecomment-799542763 to determine that `brew doctor`'s output is indeed very unhelpful.\r\n\r\n### What happened (include all command output)?\r\n\r\n1. Simulate having a `font-dejavu-sans` cask from before it was removed (?).\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/font-dejavu-sans\r\n```\r\n2. run `brew doctor`\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nbrew doctor should explain that I have an obsolete cask and what I should do to remove it so that brew doctor can work.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it should tell me a full path to things it doesn't like so I at least know where to look (I have two instances of `brew` installed, the other runs under rosetta).\r\n\r\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmkdir -p /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/font-dejavu-sans\r\nbrew doctor\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
