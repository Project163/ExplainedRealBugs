Normally, after the install, [`fix_dynamic_linkage`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/7b1e47558b5a544eb819b9af9b83db3e30386c8c/Library/Homebrew/extend/os/mac/keg_relocate.rb#L42) will turn this into an absolute path (i.e. something like `/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib/tcltls1.7.22/tcltls.dylib`).\r\n\r\nFor some reason, `fix_dynamic_linkage` fails to do this, but doesn't complain about it. This only proves to be a problem when we try to bottle `tcl-tk`, and the call to [`change_dylib_id`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/8a787e45ff45583fb245030757296548f82c1cbd/Library/Homebrew/extend/os/mac/keg_relocate.rb#L26) here chokes because the new ID is for some reason an empty string.\r\n\r\nThe right fix is probably to make sure `fix_dynamic_linkage` gets the dylib ID change right the first time (this is probably [`dylib_id_for`](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/7b1e47558b5a544eb819b9af9b83db3e30386c8c/Library/Homebrew/extend/os/mac/keg_relocate.rb#L100)).\r\n\r\nBut that still leaves open the question of how this even got broken in the first place. You could try reverting my commit from the [`git bisect` above](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/12832#issuecomment-1028864039), but I would be very surprised if it helped. (Maybe there's some edge case I'm not
