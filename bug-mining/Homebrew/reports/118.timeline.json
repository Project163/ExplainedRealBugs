isn't a huge deal, but figured I'd raise the concern.\n\nI've been a long-time user of git-sync (thank you, btw) ever since switching to `gh` cli from `hub` and missing `hub sync`. I install git-sync through this homebrew tap.\n\nRecently, I've discovered that a [conflicting formula named git-sync](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/g/git-sync.rb) from kubernetes has been added to homebrew-core.\n\nThis caused the following issue in homebrew: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19294\n\nThere was then a [PR to resolve it](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19295) but that caused other issues and so it was [reverted](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19324).\n\nAt present, things have improved slightly but due to the name conflict we now get warnings from `brew doctor`:\n\n```\n$ brew doctor \nPlease note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers\nwith debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is\nworking fine: please don't worry or file an issue; just ignore this. Thanks!\n\nWarning: The following formulae have the same name as core formulae:\n  facebook/fb/watchman\n  jacobwgillespie/tap/git-sync\n  jacobwgillespie/tap/run\nTheir taps are in use, so you must use these full names throughout Homebrew.\n```\n\nPer this comment: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/19295#issuecomment-2692869207 it seems the best course of action is to rename them to not conflict. (Of course, the possibility remains that some future formula is added to core that conflicts with the _new_ names. Hopefully unlikely, but possible.)\n\nAdditionally, I would propose submitting git-sync to the core repo? I don't know how many stars/forks, etc they expect for submissions these days. But I would imagine there's a good chance it gets accepted. Perhaps with a name like `gh-sync` or `github-sync`? (I don't believe there's anything github-specific in git-sync, but presumably it's primarily meant to be paired with `gh` cli? It might be a worthwhile name just for the formula.)\n\nI acknowledge this isn't really a blocker. And the naming conflict is really more of homebrew's issue to resolve (brew should be better at handling namespaced formula names since taps are the only official way to \"namespace\" formulae). But it would still improve things if `git-sync` were in core. As for the `run` tool, 🤷 .\n\nCheers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacobwgillespie/homebrew-tap/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacobwgillespie/homebrew-tap/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2746574867","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19294#issuecomment-2746574867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19294","id":2746574867,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6jtWgT","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-24T00:16:46Z","updated_at":"2025-03-24T00:16:46Z","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Though \"incorrect\" presumes that `git info git-sync` should prefer to print the data from the tap instead of core if there is a conflict. Do I assume that's the desired behavior?

(I didn't have any prior experience with the concept of a \"rack\" so this distinction helps! appreciate that in the [terminology docs](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#homebrew-terminology))\n\nIf I'm understanding better, then would any of the following bits of data be more appropriately tied to the versioned keg that's installed?\n- version\n- description\n- url\n- 'from' formula path (already discussed)\n- license\n- dependencies\n- options\n\nIt seems that the top bits of the info output print from whatever the latest formulae has (so `version`, `description`, and `url`). Which would mean even ignoring taps, those would print the latest values from the formula, and not \"values at the time of installation\".\n\nThen there's a section that seems to read from the rack (beginning with \"Installed\"), which prints the keg path, installation date, and formula path (the latter being \"wrong\").\n\nFrom that point, it prints `license`, `dependencies`, and `options`, which similar to the top section, print values from the latest formula.\n\nIt might just be worth clarifying which sections of the output print from keg (ie, details from the keg that are pinned from what was actually the values at installation time) and which print from that rack (aka, pulling from latest formula found)?\n\n> Again: this is why shadowing formula names is not the best idea and why we now warn about it.\n\nUnderstood. I'm wondering what homebrew's recommended workflow would look like for a tap that is published with a non-conflicting rack name. It is effectively \"complete\" and working in the wild for years. And then a new formula is added to core that introduces the conflict. Is it expected that tap owners perpetually monitor and retroactively rename? (Whether the taps even still have active maintainers, notwithstanding.) Or is it recommended that taps preemptively \"namespace\" their racks with a prefix or something to reduce the chance of future conflicts that are out of their control? (One can't completely prevent a future conflict without some namespace reservation mechanism, of course.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2802447758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasonkarns","id":119972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonkarns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonkarns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2804206933","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19294#issuecomment-2804206933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/19294","id":2804206933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc6nJM1V","user":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-15T08:12:14Z","updated_at":"2025-04-15T08:12:14Z","body":"> and formula path (the latter being \"wrong\").\n\nYup, this part of \"Installed\" is the only thing that seems \"wrong\" to me.\n\n> I'm wondering what homebrew's recommended workflow would look like for a tap that is published with a non-conflicting rack name.\n\nI guess we don't have an explicit/documented recommendation here.\n\n\n> Is it expected that tap owners perpetually monitor and retroactively rename?\n\nYeh, pretty much this, unfortunately.\n\n> (Whether the taps even still have active maintainers, notwithstanding.)\n\nGiven Homebrew's rolling release nature and deprecation process: not having active maintainers often results in broken formulae, unfortunately.
