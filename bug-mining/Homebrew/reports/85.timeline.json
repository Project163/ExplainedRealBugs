Setting `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK` may be a better fit for your use-case here.\r\n\r\nI could be entirely wrong here, but this is my current model of how homebrew handles dependencies:\r\n1. There is a tree of dependencies for each formula, adding up to a graph (during my update, ffmpeg went down to one of jpeg-turbo or libpng and came back up to elixir)\r\n2. The graph is evergreen, meaning dependency versions aren't pinned. The downloaded ffmpeg was only confirmed to be compatible with the newest jpeg-turbo or libpng which was confirmed to be compatible with the newest elixir. Therefore any library that is touched by the graph needs to be updated for compatibility.\r\n3. The graph is sometimes broken, so running `brew update` will fix issues by updating to the latest graph and upgrading dependencies accordingly.\r\n4. HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE skips updating to the newest graph, so I'm out of luck if my current graph is broken.\r\n5. HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK skips checking dependencies, so I might have incompatibility errors if the dependencies are outdated.\r\n\r\nSo, if my graph is not broken, I can skip updating with HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE and install anything without any worries. Everything in the graph will be compatible with each other: the newly installed ffmpeg will work with the libpng which already works with elixir. But if I set HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK, any library I install will be the newest one, and will not necessarily work with the older installed dependencies. If ffmpeg does not play well with one of  the older dependencies for some reason, I'll have to upgrade all of them, which will have ripple effects through all the libraries I have installed with brew.\r\n\r\nI understand that brew does not want to get involved with versioned dependencies, so I just want my decision to stay on an earlier dependency graph to be respected. But as I found out that it was a one-time message, it's now just not really important. Maybe add that information to the nag?\r\n\r\n~~I also found the update post at https://brew.sh/2023/07/20/homebrew-4.1.0/ , but I still don't know how the update behavior is changed compared to before.~~ Finally found the relevant blog post: https://brew.sh/2023/02/16/homebrew-4.0.0/ . I still believe the nag would be more useful if it contained the following info: \"The most significant change since 3.6.0 enables significantly faster Homebrew-maintained tap updates by migrating from Git-cloned taps to JSON downloads.\" Then I could confidently drop the env variable if my concern was the slow update rather than moving between dependency graphs.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1892662148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ulucs","id":11823240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODIzMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11823240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs","html_url":"https://github.com/ulucs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11491454349,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAyxcHc58GiD4zwAAAAKs8a2N","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/events/11491454349","actor":{"login":"ulucs","id":11823240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODIzMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11823240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs","html_url":"https://github.com/ulucs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulucs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-15T19:10:35Z","rename":{"from":"Remove
