If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nWe call this function https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/dev-cmd/bump-formula-pr.rb#L120 on bump-formula-pr because audit needs it. However, this does not need to be called if the `no-audit=true` flag is provided right? \r\n\r\nCan we disable this call when not needed? Happy to submit a PR if you think this request is reasonable. \n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nWe run bump-formula-pr in out automation scripts for cloudflared with `no-audit`. The bundle install seems quite unncessary on clean builds. \n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nThis will only be relevant to automated runs of bump-formula-pr from clean environments which force a gem bundle build every time. \n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\na custom variant of this script can be run but that seems ugly.","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
