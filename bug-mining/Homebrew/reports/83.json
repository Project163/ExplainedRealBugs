If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nI've been using [`rc`](https://github.com/rakitzis/rc), a version of the V10 UNIX (and Plan 9) standard shell (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc)), with Homebrew for a while. It works well, but the one thing that bothers me is that the profile output won't work.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n; brew info ncurses\r\n...\r\nFor compilers to find ncurses you may need to set:\r\n\r\nFor pkg-config to find ncurses you may need to set:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is rather insufficient, but quite easy to fix. In fact, I fixed it on my machine already (will contribute a PR right after typing this):\r\n\r\n```\r\n; brew info ncurses\r\n...\r\nFor compilers to find ncurses you may need to set:\r\n  LDFLAGS=(-L/opt/homebrew/opt/ncurses/lib)\r\n  CPPFLAGS=(-I/opt/homebrew/opt/ncurses/include)\r\n\r\nFor pkg-config to find ncurses you may need to set:\r\n  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=(/opt/homebrew/opt/ncurses/lib/pkgconfig)\r\n```\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nSee above.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nIt probably will not, but I'd *guess* that most supported shells are neither, and I already did (most of?) the work for you. :-)\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nUsing a different, probably less standard shell (won't happen).","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/16264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/16264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
