I think we should run a check when adding to the queue to prevent the download from proceeding if it won't be installed.\n\n\n### What happened (include all command output)?\n\nExample 1: Install `a-slower-speed-of-light` (disabled cask)\n```\nbrew install a-slower-speed-of-light\n==> Fetching downloads for: a-slower-speed-of-light\n✔︎ Cask a-slower-speed-of-light (2020)\nError: Cask 'a-slower-speed-of-light' has been disabled because it is discontinued upstream! It was disabled on 2024-12-16.\n```\n\nThe download is fetched, and then we exit without installed.\n\nExample 2: Conflicting cask `zotero` and `zotero@beta`.\n**With `zotero@beta` installed`**\n```\nbrew install zotero\n==> Fetching downloads for: zotero\n✔︎ Cask zotero (7.0.22)\nError: Cask 'zotero' conflicts with 'zotero@beta'.\n```\n\nThe download is fetched, and we exit without install.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI would expect the download to not occur if we are preventing installation.\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\n\n```shell\nSee above.\n```","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/20374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/20374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
