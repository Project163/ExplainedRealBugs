See [Homebrew/homebrew-core@fd1c80d](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/fd1c80d8a7955be8aa8d787a045efb3ec9eaa076).\r\n> \r\n> This is basically the problem I describe at [#17281 (comment)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/17281#issuecomment-2106243956).\r\n\r\nThat problem was fixed. I cannot reproduce this locally. If I run `brew bottle ack --json --only-json-tab` I get:\r\n- the same checksum every time\r\n- a `ack/3.7.0/sbom.spdx.json` that does not contain any of the fields you mention\r\n\r\nThis was not the case before that was fixed.\r\n\r\nThis is because we're passing `bottling:` to skip these at `brew bottle` time:\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/cb168dfe6df49b3dbf5261265d6838c48141ca52/Library/Homebrew/dev-cmd/bottle.rb#L511\r\n\r\nThese values are only being added at `brew install` time: \r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/610b80e6374cfa7f2e9b1409cd7272c158bbef4e/Library/Homebrew/formula_installer.rb#L835\r\n\r\nSo this is an issue with either `brew test-bot` or our homebrew-core CI workflows that is somehow resulting in attempting to double-bottle or use older/cached, broken SBOMs in bottles or something. An issue should probably be opened somewhere but I don't think it's this issue and I don't think (for now) it's Homebrew/brew.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/2132251979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
