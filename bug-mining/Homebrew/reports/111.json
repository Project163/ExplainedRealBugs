My problem is that in this the following rule is not applied:\r\n\r\n> \"In embedded patches, the string “HOMEBREW_PREFIX” is replaced with the value of the constant HOMEBREW_PREFIX before the patch is applied.\"\r\n\r\nSo I would like to enable this replacement (perhaps guarded by a boolean flag?).\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nThis would allow us to move the embeded patches to external diff files.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nWould make maintaining complex formulas with large diffs easier, and easier to configure formatter onto the formula files (as the formatter would not impact the diffs).\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nKeeping the diff embeded means I cannot use formatter on the formula file.","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
