root cause of @dmilith's issue is that he enabled `core.fsmonitor=true` in his global git config. This causes `git fsmonitor--daemon` to monitor all of his repos by default, including Homebrew's. The monitor process is what's holding the lock file. You can verify this by running:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nps -p $(lsof -t +d $(brew --prefix)/var/homebrew/locks)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will show something like this if `git fsmonitor--daemon` is holding the lock file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  501 77962     1   0  8:06AM ??         0:00.05 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/git/2.37.1/libexec/git-core/git fsmonitor--daemon run --detach --ipc-threads=8\r\n```\r\n\r\nI worked around this by setting `core.fsmonitor=false` for Homebrew's repo:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit config --file $HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY/.git/config --replace-all core.fsmonitor false\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally Homebrew would set this git config on initial repo
