If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nThe core formulae are not included in some commands like `brew info` when using `--eval-all`.\r\n\r\nFor some commands this is a problem with the `Formula.all` method which loads them from files not names. Of course, local formula files don't exist if you're only using the API. This should get updated to use formula names instead of files to load formulae. The `Formula.full_names` method might work here.\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\nCommands should work as expected when using the API.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nThe `--eval-all` switch is used by a large number of built-in commands but only seems not to work correctly with the following ones.\r\n\r\n- `brew deps`\r\n- `brew info`\r\n- `brew options`\r\n- `brew readall`\r\n- `brew uses`\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nIgnoring this...","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/15122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
