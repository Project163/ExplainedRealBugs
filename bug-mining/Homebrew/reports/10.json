`brew config` output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n➜ docker run --rm homebrew/brew:3.2.5 brew config\r\nError: Running Homebrew as root is extremely dangerous and no longer supported.\r\nAs Homebrew does not

problem.\r\n\r\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\r\n\r\nI'm currently working to add a new package, and am attempting to run `brew` via Docker to avoid installing it directly on my system -- because I do not install packages via shell scripts (only through my system package manager), and there is not a currently available package for my particular Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n### What happened (include all command output)?\r\n\r\nRunning any command at all results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜ docker run --rm homebrew/brew:latest brew help\r\nError: Running Homebrew as root is extremely dangerous and no longer supported.\r\nAs Homebrew does not drop privileges on installation you would be giving all\r\nbuild scripts full access to your system.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to happen?\r\n\r\nI would expect the docker image to invoke the `brew` executable without issue.\r\n\r\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ docker pull homebrew/brew:3.2.5\r\n$ docker run --rm homebrew/brew brew <any subcommand>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note that the `3.2.5` tag is currently mapped to the same digest as `latest`.**\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/11802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/11802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
