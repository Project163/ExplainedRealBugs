a similar problem with `brew --cache`:\n```\n~ % brew --CACHE\nError: undefined method `__cache' for module Homebrew\n/opt/homebrew/Library/Homebrew/brew.rb:97:in `public_send'\n/opt/homebrew/Library/Homebrew/brew.rb:97:in `<main>'\nPlease report this issue:\n  https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting\n```\n\n#18705 partially addressed this issue here:\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/de294f314f5a566441b7846c23dd7b37dfb056a5/Library/Homebrew/brew.rb#L96-L100\n\nThis doesn't handle cases where the string in the `NoMethodError` is not correctly predicted with `cmd.downcase` (like `--CACHE`) or when there actually is a method, but it's private (which is the case for `brew INSTALL`).\n\nFWIW, the private `Homebrew.install` method is actually from `FileUtils.install`:\n```\nbrew(main):004> Homebrew.method(:install)\n=> #<Method: #<Class:Homebrew>(FileUtils)#install(src, dest, mode: ..., owner: ..., group: ..., preserve: ..., noop: ..., verbose: ...) /opt/homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/3.3.7/lib/ruby/3.3.0/fileutils.rb:1609>\n```\n…and it's pulled into the `Homebrew` module's namespace here:\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/de294f314f5a566441b7846c23dd7b37dfb056a5/Library/Homebrew/global.rb#L59-L60\n\nThat has no bearing on a fix, but I spent quite a while looking into that mystery, so I'd thought I'd share.\n\nI'll send a PR shortly that fixes what I've detailed above, but…\n\nThe warnings (`warning: already initialized constant`) are another problem altogether. They are caused by a recursive `require`, and I'm pretty sure it's actually a ruby bug. The warnings from `brew INFO` better illuminate what's going on:\n```\n~ % brew INFO\n/opt/homebrew/Library/Homebrew/cmd/INFO.rb:19: warning: already initialized constant
