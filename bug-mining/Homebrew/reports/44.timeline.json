By orphans, do you mean formulae installed as dependencies but no longer needed (because all their dependents are no longer installed)?\r\n\r\nNot quite (although the formulae you describe are a subset of what I'm referring to). For the purposes of my provisioning script, orphans include formulae installed explicitly in a previous run (or directly via `brew install`) but not currently appearing in a list of required formulae, along with any dependencies that would be orphaned after their removal. Unfortunately it's not possible (as best I can tell) for Homebrew's state to be updated to reflect the formulae I'm keeping / not keeping (i.e. something equivalent to `pacman -D --asexplicit`/`pacman -D --asdeps` on Arch Linux, or `apt-mark auto`/`apt-mark manual` on Debian/Ubuntu), so I'm left with manually enumerating the required formulae and their dependencies and comparing it with installed formulae to determine which formulae will be orphaned *after installing any new formulae*. (Part of the objective is to make provisioning a one-step process--i.e. decide what's being installed and removed before actioning anything).\r\n\r\n> Are you interested in this list of orphans for informational purposes only, or is there something specific you wish to do with orphaned formulae?\r\n\r\nMy provisioning script offers to remove them.\r\n\r\n> Does your provisioning script use `brew bundle`?\r\n\r\nI looked into moving to `brew bundle` recently, but it's more prescriptive than what I'm currently using and is better suited to CI environments (rather than system-wide provisioning with platform- and configuration-specific variations). TL;DR: no, I'm not using `brew bundle`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, interesting as all of this may be, my particular use case has limited relevance to making `brew deps` reliable, effective and consistent for all users 😉 ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1192334763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lkrms","id":2563783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjM3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2563783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms","html_url":"https://github.com/lkrms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkrms/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1213601087","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/13592#issuecomment-1213601087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13592","id":1213601087,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc5IVhU_","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-13T00:07:51Z","updated_at":"2022-08-13T00:07:51Z","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
