The change is because if you use bottles and casks at the same time you may have poor results during install/update when that is set to something other than a forward proxy.  JFrog's expectations was that the functionality just worked, but they didn't actually test it against Casks. While they can handle mirroring the GitHub Packages source they can't handle the arbitrary sourcing needed for Cask support which is why they added the comments to their KB noting the conflict.\r\n\r\nOriginally I had poked at `HOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN` to try and scope it only to bottles but it seems to try the tar.gz structure instead of the blob/sha256 we would have in the OCI registry mirror as noted in #11781.\r\n\r\nAnd if anyone has a method to allow for steering brew to a Packages mirror for bottles and falling back to standard proxy environment variables for casks I am game.  The current workaround for folks is to do their install upgrade using the mirror and then unset `HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN` so that the casks that fail downloading will successfully download.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1116063860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"byjrack","id":26876044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc2MDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26876044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack","html_url":"https://github.com/byjrack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/comments/1116492869","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/13226#issuecomment-1116492869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13226","id":1116492869,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyxcHc5CjFRF","user":{"login":"byjrack","id":26876044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODc2MDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26876044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack","html_url":"https://github.com/byjrack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byjrack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-03T19:42:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T12:55:37Z","body":"And @MikeMcQuaid I was making the assumption that folks were using that existing model and was thinking of do no harm.  Now I am curious on the perimeter solution that works in that way (reverse proxy/webapp), but that's just my experience w proxy environments.  And also it is based off the docs as well where any URL gets a prefix which given for ghcr.io you actually will replace and not prefix.\r\n\r\nNow if `HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN` should only be replaced on matches for the GitHub Packages endpoint I am wondering if there is a bug in the regex.  Now I have not spent a ton of time on ruby code so I may be reading this wrong.  \r\n\r\nCurrently the url.sub(...) call that is used into when artifact_domain uses a regex with a submatch on Packages:URL which means it also matches \"https\" as well and will replace that with the content of artifact_domain.  If you remove that submatch on Packages (which I think was intended) than the URL substitution will only happen for ghcr.io endpoints and ignore any others (e.g. Casks).\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\nurl1

Small change to regex in the GitHubPackages::URL_DOMAIN where an extra set of parens created a match on https and not just on the content of the URL_DOMAIN const.  This resulted in prefixing of Cask download URLs in a fashion that was unlikely to be supported on most proxies and couldn't be supported on Package mirrors (e.g JFrog Artifactory).  This adjusts the regex to remove the extra submatch so that use of the HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN envvar will only replace the content of the const and not match the \"https\" token.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"UiP9AV6Y","id":33967640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTY3NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33967640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y","html_url":"https://github.com/UiP9AV6Y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UiP9AV6Y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T08:43:27Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T08:43:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/13313","id":1244793425,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAyxcHc44RfJO","number":13313,"title":"decouple
