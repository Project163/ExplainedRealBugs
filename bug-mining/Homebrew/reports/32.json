doctor` and that did not fix my problem.\n\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\n\nwe use `brew` in our CI system and want to avoid hitting upstream servers with too many requests. therefor we want to utilize a cache.\r\n\n\n### What happened (include all command output)?\n\ninstalling casks/formulae with `HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN` configured\r\nresults in URLs being rewritten in two different ways.\r\n\r\n> brew install wget\r\n```\r\n==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/gettext/manifests/0.21\r\n==> Downloading from

to happen?\n\nasset URLs hosted under `ghcr.io` get transformed into a format understood by container registry mirrors such as harbor and artifactory. this is also the documented behaviour.\r\n\r\nall other URLs get simply prefixed with the configured artifact domain, resulting in a protocol scheme to appear twice in the URL (`https://cache.my.corp/docker-github/https://example.com/foo.tar.gz`). i am not sure, which software is supposed to handle URLs formatted like this.\r\n\r\nin another [issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/12568#issuecomment-994970291) it is explained, that *HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN* is inteded to be used with proxies, which i do not understand, given that *http_proxy* et al. are the environment variables to be used with HTTP proxies.\r\n\r\ngiven the lack of unit tests for this feature, i do not know if the observed behaviour is correct and the documentation is incomplete or vice-versa.\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\n\n```shell\n`env HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN=https://cache.my.corp/docker-github \\\r\nbrew install --casks corretto`\r\n`env HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN=https://cache.my.corp/docker-github \\\r\nbrew install wget`\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/13222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
