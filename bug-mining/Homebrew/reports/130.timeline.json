Summary\r\n\r\nFixes #20374 by implementing a `prelude` method for `Cask::Installer` that performs early validation checks before cask downloads are enqueued.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using `HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY`, Homebrew was downloading cask binaries before checking if the cask could actually be installed. This resulted in:\r\n\r\n- Unnecessary downloads for disabled casks (e.g., `a-slower-speed-of-light`)\r\n- Unnecessary downloads for casks with conflicts (e.g. installing `zotero` when conflicting with `zotero@beta`)\r\n- Downloads completing before validation failures were reported\r\n\r\nThe issue occurred because deprecation/disable checks and conflict checks were only performed in the `install` method, which runs after downloads are fetched from the download queue.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded a `prelude` method to `Cask::Installer` that mirrors the functionality of `Formula#prelude_fetch`:\r\n\r\n1. **New `prelude` method**: Calls `check_deprecate_disable` and `check_conflicts` early\r\n2. **Early validation**: Prelude is called before enqueueing downloads in all scenarios\r\n3. **Idempotent**: Uses `@ran_prelude` instance variable to prevent duplicate execution\r\n4. **Efficient**: Refactored download queue code to create installer objects once and reuse them\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- **`Library/Homebrew/cask/installer.rb`**: Added `prelude` method and `@ran_prelude` tracking\r\n- **`Library/Homebrew/cmd/install.rb`**: Call prelude before \"Fetching downloads for:\" message\r\n- **`Library/Homebrew/cask/reinstall.rb`**: Call prelude before enqueueing downloads\r\n- **`Library/Homebrew/cask/upgrade.rb`**: Call prelude before enqueueing downloads\r\n\r\n## Behavior\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n```\r\n$ HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY=4 brew install --cask a-slower-speed-of-light\r\nFetching downloads for: a-slower-speed-of-light\r\n==> Downloading https://github.com/MIT-Game-Lab/A-Slower-Speed-of-Light/releases/download/v1.0/A_Slower_Speed_of_Light_OSX.zip\r\nError: a-slower-speed-of-light has been disabled because it is not maintained upstream\\!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n```\r\n$ HOMEBREW_DOWNLOAD_CONCURRENCY=4 brew install --cask a-slower-speed-of-light\r\nError: a-slower-speed-of-light has been disabled because it is not maintained upstream\\!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe validation failure now occurs immediately without any download activity or \"Fetching downloads for:\" message.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- [x] Existing cask installer tests pass\r\n- [x] Style checks pass (`brew style` on all modified files)\r\n- [x] Maintains backward compatibility for non-download-queue scenarios\r\n- [x] Early validation works for disabled casks\r\n- [x] Early validation works for conflicting casks\r\n- [x] No duplicate installer object creation\r\n\r\n🤖 Generated with [Claude
