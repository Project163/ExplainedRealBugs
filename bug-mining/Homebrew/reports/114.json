ready to brew.` and am still able to reproduce my issue.\n- [X] I ran `brew update` and am still able to reproduce my issue.\n- [X] I have resolved all warnings from `brew doctor` and that did not fix my problem.\n- [X] I searched for recent similar issues at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue and found no duplicates.\n\n### What were you trying to do (and why)?\n\nInstalled podman  and tried to start the service via `brew services start podman`.\n\n### What happened (include all command output)?\n\n`==> Successfully started `podman` (label: homebrew.podman)`\r\n\r\nDespite the message, podman did not start.\r\n\r\nThese loglines were present in systemd logs when using `journalctl --user -u homebrew.podman`\r\n\r\n```\r\nNov 20 17:49:22 pop-os systemd[1687]: Started Homebrew generated unit for podman.\r\nNov 20 17:49:22 pop-os podman[113259]: Error: unknown flag: --time\\\r\nNov 20 17:49:22 pop-os podman[113259]: See 'podman system service --help'\r\nNov 20 17:49:22 pop-os systemd[1687]: homebrew.podman.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=125/n/a\r\nNov 20 17:49:22 pop-os systemd[1687]: homebrew.podman.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.\r\n```\r\nInspecting the Homebrew generated `homebrew.podman.service` reveals a problem with this particular line:\r\n\r\n`ExecStart=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/podman/bin/podman system service --time\\=0`.\r\n\r\nThe backslash here prevents the systemd from starting the service.\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nPodman to start.\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\n\n```shell\n- `brew install podman`\r\n- `brew services start podman`\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/18802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/18802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
