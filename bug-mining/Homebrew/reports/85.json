If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.\n\n### Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature\n\nRemove the following nag:\r\n\r\n``` \r\n==> You have set:\r\n  HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE\r\nbut we have dramatically sped up and fixed many bugs in the way we do Homebrew updates since.\r\nPlease consider unsetting these and tweaking the values based on the new behaviour.\r\n```\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\n1. I have set the environment variable for a reason\r\n2. The mentioned \"changes\" are very vague, there is no way of me finding out how the changes effect my use case\r\n3. In the blame, I found out that the changes were made before I set the environment variable, so the changes are moot for me either way. No date is specified in the nag text.\r\n4. I do not like being nagged about making changes that will make homebrew more frustrating to use for me.\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nBetter user experience since they are not nagged. They will also not mistakenly revert their environment variable which would make them go through the update process they have specifically tried to avoid.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\n- Adding a link to how homebrew updates have changed, so users can make a more informed decision\r\n- Not showing the nag text if the user has set the environment variable after the changes have been made","closed_by":{"login":"MikeMcQuaid","id":125011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid","html_url":"https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MikeMcQuaid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/16481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/16481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
