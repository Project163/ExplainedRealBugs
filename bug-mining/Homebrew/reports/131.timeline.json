Summary\n- Fixes #18556 by implementing a `rustc_wrapper` shim that uses `RUSTC_WRAPPER` instead of setting `RUSTFLAGS` directly\n- Allows Homebrew's optimization flags to coexist with project `.cargo/config.toml` settings\n- Prevents build failures when Rust projects have their own configuration that conflicts with Homebrew's `RUSTFLAGS`\n\n## Implementation Details\n- Added `rustc_wrapper` shim in `shims/super/` that clears `RUSTFLAGS` and prepends `HOMEBREW_RUSTFLAGS`\n- Updated both `std` and `super` environments to use `RUSTC_WRAPPER` pointing to the shim\n- Changed from setting `RUSTFLAGS` to `HOMEBREW_RUSTFLAGS` to avoid direct environment conflicts\n\n## Test plan\n- [x] Test building Rust formulae that previously failed due to RUSTFLAGS conflicts\n- [x] Verify optimization flags are still applied when appropriate\n- [x] Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` settings are respected\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude
