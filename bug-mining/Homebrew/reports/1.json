I would expect that `brew install --build-from-source` would include dependencies. But it doesn't.\r\n\r\nIn the man page I see `Dependencies will still be installed from bottles if they are available.`, so this seems to be intended behaviour and why I created this as a feature request and not a bug.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ brew install --build-from-source ffmpeg\r\n...\r\n# ffmpeg installed\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ brew install --build-from-source ffmpeg\r\n...\r\nError: nasm: no bottle available!\r\nYou can try to install from source with:\r\n  brew install --build-from-source nasm\r\n...\r\n$ brew install --build-from-source nasm\r\n...\r\n$ brew install --build-from-source ffmpeg\r\n...\r\nError: pkg-config: no bottle available!\r\nYou can try to install from source with:\r\n  brew install --build-from-source pkg-config\r\n...\r\n```\n\n### What is the motivation for the feature?\n\n1. Better user experience when installing packages from source\r\n1. I would also imagine that this would match behaviour when not using `--build-from-source`, which I would expect does not require installation of all dependencies manually\n\n### How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?\n\nI don't know anything about the demographic breakdown of Homebrew users, but assuming 90% of Homebrew users are not running an unsupported version of macOS, this feature will likely not be relevant to them.\n\n### What alternatives to the feature have been considered?\n\nAnother option might be to have some sort of additional parameter, e.g. `--include-dependencies` or `--build-dependencies-from-source` to allow enabling this behaviour explicitly.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"carlocab","id":30379873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzc5ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30379873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab","html_url":"https://github.com/carlocab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/10832/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/10832/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
