The error occurs on the `printf` line:\r\n```\r\n    if [[ ! -f \"${HOMEBREW_PATHS_FILE}\" ]]\r\n    then\r\n      printf '%s/bin\\n%s/sbin\\n' \"${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}\" \"${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}\" >\"${HOMEBREW_PATHS_FILE}\" 2>/dev/null\r\n    fi\r\n```\n\n### What did you expect to happen?\n\nI expected the shell to start without error.\n\n### Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew` commands)\n\n```shell\nI believe that the underlying issue is that immediately after updating Homebrew, `/opt/homebrew/etc/paths` did not exist. (This is ${HOMEBREW_PATHS_FILE}.)\r\n\r\nWhen I logged out of my admin account, logged into my user account, and started a shell, my user account did not have permission to create the file (by writing into the Homebrew directory), and thus the error.\r\n\r\nThe error *went away* after I logged back into my admin account and started a new shell under that account. The admin account was able to create the file, and thus when I subsequently went back to my user account and started a shell, the error did not occur.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the error will occur if the \"${HOMEBREW_PATHS_FILE}\" does not exist and the user running the `shellenv.sh` script does not have permission to create it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* [Preparation.] Using an appropriate account, delete the \"${HOMEBREW_PATHS_FILE}\" if it exists.\r\n\r\n* Switch users to an account that cannot write in the installed Homebrew tree.\r\n\r\n* Start a `tcsh` shell and run the following command:\r\n\r\neval `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv`\r\n```\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlocab","id":30379873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzc5ODcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30379873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab","html_url":"https://github.com/carlocab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlocab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/18301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/issues/18301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
