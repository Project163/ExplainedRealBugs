I understand your argument above and thank you for the PR you submitted, which will indeed make it much less confusing.\r\n\r\nAs for the `messed up`, I stand by it: try `brew ls` when your terminal uses 2 spaces for tabs (`tabs -2`). Nothing is aligned. Here is a screenshot so that things aren't fixed by GitHub defaulting to 8 spaces per tab:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1290\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-03-24 at 11 12 53\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106682/112244053-fd22e080-8c91-11eb-915d-ba7bda36008b.png\">\r\n\r\nRelying on tabs (of unknown width) for padding doesn't work, formulaes should use space characters like casks do. Looking at the code, I realize it's an artifact of delegating to different commands (`ls` vs `find`). Maybe some filtering of the output to replace tabs with 8 spaces would fix
