Overview\n\nWhen using linked_clones, If the master VM is manually removed from VirtualBox a user will get a Box with UUID xxx-xxx-xxx Not Found error when trying to run `vagrant up` on a new machine.\n\nThis is because the master_id file exists `action/import_master.rb` sets `env[:clone_id] = master_id_file.read.chomp if master_id_file.file?`\n\nThe `action/import.rb` code assumes if `env[:clone_id]` is set then it does not need to import the box, it can just clone it.  This is not true when the master VM has manually been removed.\n\nThe `action/import_master.rb` code  seemed to be setup to handle this situation with a nice `if` statement.  All the if statement did though was log a message.\n\n```\n          if env[:clone_id] && env[:machine].provider.driver.vm_exists?(env[:clone_id])\n            @logger.info(\n              \"Master VM for '#{env[:machine].box.name}' already exists \" +\n              \" (id=#{env[:clone_id]}) - skipping import step.\")\n            return\n          end\n```\n\nThis pull request just adds an `else` to this `if` statement to remove the `env[:clone_id]` setting so that when `action/import.rb` is called it knows it needs to first import the master, then clone.\n\nFixes #6742 \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"gaurav-dalvi","id":2373663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzM2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2373663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav-dalvi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav-dalvi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-25T17:42:56Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T17:42:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/contiv/netplugin/issues/334","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/contiv/netplugin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/contiv/netplugin/issues/334/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/contiv/netplugin/issues/334/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/contiv/netplugin/issues/334/events","html_url":"https://github.com/contiv/netplugin/issues/334","id":150934581,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTA5MzQ1ODE=","number":334,"title":"There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant for controlling VirtualBox.
