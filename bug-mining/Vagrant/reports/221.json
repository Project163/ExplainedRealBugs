triggers:\r\n\r\n `  config.trigger.before :provision do |trigger|`\r\n\r\nand running `vagrant provision`, the trigger should trigger once before provisioning begins, and once after it finishes\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nInstead the behaviour has fundamentally changed to instead be run before every individual provisioner. In our project it now runs a post provisioner script 17 times that used to run once, triggering rate limiting and spamming the terminal output\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add a trigger on provision e.g. `  config.trigger.before :provision do |trigger|`\r\n2. Have multiple provisioners defined\r\n3. Run `vagrant up --provision`\r\n4. Observe duplicate trigger runs\r\n\r\nIt also seems that one of those triggers must try to run a script inside the VM for this to work if this is to be reproduced with `vagrant up --provision`, otherwise it requires `vagrant provision`, the behaviour between the two is inconsistent, see comments below\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\nI believe this is a regression caused by an attempt to fix #11898 in #12014:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11898\r\n- https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/pull/12014\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12034/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
