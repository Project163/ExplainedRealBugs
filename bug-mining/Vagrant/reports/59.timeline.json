I've seen `vagrant rsync` peak at 13 concurrent shells per invocation. Ansible seem to get by with just 2 or 3 on the same box.\n\nIf you can get to PowerShell during `vagrant up`, you can track concurrent shells at any point in time via `@(Get-Process winrshost).Count`.\n\nThat said, I think we may be running into the same problem (#7486) – likely during \"Sharing cookbooks with VM\" in your case.

30](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee309367%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)) and `vagrant rsync` fails, as it is unable to create any new shells via WinRM.\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Run `vagrant rsync` (4 times)\n### Workaround\n\nOn the guest, in PowerShell: `Restart-Service WinRM`. This kills off the orphaned `winrshost.exe` processes and (more importantly) resets the internal session counter in

Windows 2008 r2, and I'm only using the shell-provisioner to echo \"hello world\", so i guess this is not a particular use case - Might even be worth updating the winrm-config guide at https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes/base.html ?\n\nI'll make a note of winrm configs needed to echo \"hello world\" via shell provisioner and share it here once I finally get it...\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/227119289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JulianMay","id":1412348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTIzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay","html_url":"https://github.com/JulianMay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/227124578","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7489#issuecomment-227124578","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7489","id":227124578,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzEyNDU3OA==","user":{"login":"JulianMay","id":1412348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTIzNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1412348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay","html_url":"https://github.com/JulianMay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulianMay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T12:08:34Z","updated_at":"2016-06-20T12:08:46Z","body":"Got
