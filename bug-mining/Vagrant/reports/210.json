Vagrant version\r\n\r\nVagrant 2.2.7\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release \r\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\r\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04\r\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial\r\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n\r\nFull Vagrant file: https://gist.github.com/apyrgio/0369cbb2fa29483baaecb78c0e9c2751#file-vagrantfile\r\n\r\nRelevant section from the Vagrantfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.vm.network \"forwarded_port\", guest: 32123, host: 6174, guest_ip: \"10.10.10.10\", host_ip: \"0.0.0.0\", auto_correct: false, id: \"sync\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\n\r\nGist: https://gist.github.com/apyrgio/0369cbb2fa29483baaecb78c0e9c2751#file-vagrant-log\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe VM should have started successfully, and the guest port (\"10.10.10.10\", 32123) should be forwarded to all interfaces in the host (\"0.0.0.0\", 6174). This works with Vagrant 2.2.4.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the logs, the VM failed to start because Vagrant attempted to connect to (\"0.0.0.0\", 6174) for a port detection check. There are two issues with that:\r\n\r\n1. Vagrant should handle `host_ip: \"0.0.0.0\"` as it would handle an empty `host_ip` option, since they are equivalent.\r\n2. Whatever happens during port detection, it should show up as a warning at most. If the port detection check is advisory, then it shouldn't affect `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\nAs for what changed from Vagrant 2.2.4: it seems that commit ade076cabbbf072382c9cbff9a9898e5a3ccf037 did not add a case for `host_ip: \"0.0.0.0\"`, and has caused this regression.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstall Vagrant 2.2.7 and put in an existing Vagrantfile the following section:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.vm.network \"forwarded_port\", guest: 32123, host: 6174, host_ip: \"0.0.0.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbonhag","id":6937257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzcyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6937257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonhag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
