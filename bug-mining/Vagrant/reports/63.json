The temporary file is created in an insecure manner with a race before using sudo privileges to write back to `/etc/exports`\n2. It doesn't work properly for multiple users on a single system, because the file `/tmp/exports` isn't removed. As a result, after user1 runs vagrant, then user2 tries but can't write to `/tmp/exports` because it's owned by user1, so previously-added vagrant NFS exports are lost as the users toggle back and forth.\n\nFor the security race, there's a trivial attack where a separate unprivileged user on the host can add arbitrary entries to `/etc/exports`. I can provide details as necessary.\n### Vagrant version\n\nVagrant 1.8.6 (all versions)\n### Host operating system\n\nFedora 24 (any Linux)\n### Guest operating system\n\nany\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
