Are you by chance running a WinRM service on port 5985 of your Windows 10 host?  If so, I would expect the forwarded port to be fixed due to a collision.  However, this port didn't get remapped in my testing.  This means that WinRM commands are being received by the host, rather than the guest. \r\n\r\nI was able to provision the guest by commenting out this line in your Vagrantfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5985, host: 5985, id: \"winrm\", auto_correct: true #, host_ip: \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich in turn uses the default port forwards for WinRM.\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> default: Forwarding ports...\r\n    ...\r\n    default: 5985 (guest) => 55985 (host) (adapter 1)\r\n    default: 5986 (guest) => 55986 (host) (adapter 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that Vagrant should be detecting that this port is already in use, though, so we will look into why that isn't happening here.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/562301412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jbonhag","id":6937257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzcyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6937257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonhag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2867381614,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4NjczODE2MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/2867381614","actor":{"login":"jbonhag","id":6937257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzcyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6937257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonhag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-09T18:22:30Z","label":{"name":"regression","color":"e5004c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2898437153,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjg5ODQzNzE1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/2898437153","actor":{"login":"jbonhag","id":6937257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzcyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6937257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonhag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonhag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ade076cabbbf072382c9cbff9a9898e5a3ccf037","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/commits/ade076cabbbf072382c9cbff9a9898e5a3ccf037","created_at":"2019-12-19T19:46:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/579042458","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11236#issuecomment-579042458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11236","id":579042458,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTA0MjQ1OA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_ad
