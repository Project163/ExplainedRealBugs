The same behaviour with **vagrant up**\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. I'm using catalog for box versioning as you can see in my vagrantfile and I have this file on localhost\r\n2. I have even tried putting this file at same path of vagrantfile but still no success\r\n3.    Box updates are not even being check on vagrant up\r\n\r\n### References\r\nI have the same problem like it is described in issue https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10254 \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
