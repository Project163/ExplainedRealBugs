without any problem, because the is not actually refused by the server.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe ssh client (Vagrant, with specific patch https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/main/lib/vagrant/patches/net-ssh.rb) is assuming that, because the ssh key is RSA, it's necessary SHA1, and it fails i.e. in \"vagrant provision\", despite the fact that \"vagrant ssh\" works well.\r\nIf you generate a ssh-key with \"ssh-keygen -t rsa-sha2-512\", it specifically uses the SHA2 algorithm, but this patch assumes that it can only be SHA1, because it's RSA:\r\n\r\n\"if s_ver >= Gem::Version.new(\"7.2\") && pub_key.is_a?(OpenSSL::PKey::RSA)\"\r\n\r\nI'm working with OpenStack, but I guess it won't change in another situation. Reverting to Vagrant 2.2.15 solves (temporarily) the issue.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12344/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
