Vagrant version\n\nVagrant 1.8.1\n### Host operating system\n\nWindows 7 Enterprise\n### Guest operating system\n\nWindows 2012r2\n### Vagrantfile\n\nUsing the Vagrantfile under development directory in this repository https://github.com/mefellows/vagrant-dsc.git\n\nThe failing line is:\n\n``` ruby\n  # Upload Website\n  config.vm.provision \"file\", source: \"website\", destination: \"C:\\\\MyWebApp\"\n```\n\nIt is attempting to recursively upload the website directory (really only 1 file) into this destination after creating it, but it fails to perform the create. Changing this to not include the drive as part of the path works, but it shouldn't fail if a drive is included as well.\n### Failure output\n\n```\n==> default: Running provisioner: file...\nThe following WinRM command responded with a non-zero exit status.\nVagrant assumes that this means the command failed!\n\nmkdir C:\\ -force\n\nStdout from the command:\n\n\n\nStderr from the command:\n\n#< CLIXML\n<Objs Version=\"1.1.0.1\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04\"><S S=\"Error\">mkdir : The path is not of a legal form._x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\">At line:2 char:1_x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\">+ mkdir C:\\ -force_x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\">+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~_x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\">    + CategoryInfo\n : InvalidArgument: (C:\\:String) [New-Item], Argume _x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\">   ntException_x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\">    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CreateDirectoryArgumentError,Microsoft.PowerShel _x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\">   l.Commands.NewItemCommand_x000D__x000A_</S><S S=\"Error\"> _x000D__x000A_</S></Objs>\n```\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should have created the folder and uploaded the files.\n### Actual behavior\n\nIt fails to create the folders and therefore the vagrant up fails. It appears that the syntax for mkdir differs between cmd and Powershell, and when running through WinRM the command runs as Powershell. In Powershell mkdir is recursive, so it will create the entire path defined in one call, rather than having to mkdir -p or loop over the folders precreating each level.\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Using a Windows 2012r2 evaluation build a box with chocolatey preinstalled (https://github.com/dragon788/windows has an example)\n2. Add box to system as win2012r2\n3. Modify Vagrantfile to remove mfellows/ from config.vm.box.\n4. vagrant up and see if you get the same failure.\n### References\n\nPerhaps similar to

Description\r\nIf there is a space in a file's destination path of a file provisioner running on Windows, the provisioner fails with error when creating the destination file's parent directory.\r\n\r\nSeems like a problem with proper quoting of spaces in filesystem paths.\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\nVagrant 2.0.1\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nmacOS 10.13.2 (17C205)\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nWindows 7 Pro SP1 FPP Czech\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\r\n  # ...\r\n  config.vm.define 'win' do |win|\r\n    win.vm.box = \"some/win7prosp1box\"\r\n    # ...\r\n    win.vm.provision 'file', source: 'vagrant/firefox-autoconfig.js', destination: 'C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js'\r\n    # ...\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/dusek/a2a77f9ecff823f194496709ba0a8d9f\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n- the `vagrant up` command would not error\r\n- the file on host at `vagrant/firefox-autoconfig.js` would be uploaded on guest at `C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n- the `vagrant up` command errors with:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nmkdir Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences\" -force\r\n...\r\nThe string starting:\r\n+ mkdir Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences <<<< \" -force\r\nis missing the terminator: \".\r\n```\r\n- the file on guest at `C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js` does not exist\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Run `vagrant up win --provision-with file` with the above Vagrantfile (or when the machine is alread created, run `vagrant provision win --provision-with file`, i.e. for repeated testing of Vagrantfile changes)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- Tried escaping the path with one, two, three and four `\\` characters, to no avail.\r\n- Tried placing the `^` character before the space, to no avail.\r\n- Tried changing the destination path to add another non-existent directory `A B`, i.e. `C:/Program Files/A B/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js`. This led to the exact same \"point of path split\", i.e. the error message referred to the same failing command `mkdir Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences\" -force`\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- GH-7234\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/607579981","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7234#issuecomment-607579981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7234","id":607579981,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzU3OTk4MQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-02T02:07:57Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T02:07:57Z","body":"I'm going to lock this issue because it has been closed for _30 days_ ⏳.
