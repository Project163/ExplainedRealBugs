expectation is that two network adaptors should be created in Virtualbox. The first should be attached to the NAT network and allow the machine out bound connectivity. The second adapter should be attached to the Host-Only adapter connected to the vboxnet1 network. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nI get an error:\r\nA host only network interface you're attempting to configure via DHCP\r\nalready has a conflicting host only adapter with DHCP enabled. The\r\nDHCP on this adapter is incompatible with the DHCP settings. Two\r\nhost only network interfaces are not allowed to overlap, and each\r\nhost only network interface can have only one DHCP server. Please\r\nreconfigure your host only network or remove the virtual machine\r\nusing the other host only network.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Empty Virtualbox off all machines. Ensure there is only 2 vboxnet networks. \r\n2. Configure vboxnet1 to a custom dhcp range. I used 192.168.254.0/24\r\n3. vagrant up --provider=virtualbox\r\n\r\nIf you omit the name of the network vagrant will create a new vboxnet2 network and attach the adapter to that network.\r\n\r\nDestroy the VM. Modify the vboxnet2 network to be a different range. Now specify the name as vboxnet2 and run vagrant up. The same error occurs.\r\n\r\nIt appears that vagrant does not like my custom networks and gives an error when I try to use them. If I don't modify the network then it all works fine. \r\n\r\nI have been able to reproduce this with three different box files as shown in the config file above. \r\n\r\n### References\r\n-
