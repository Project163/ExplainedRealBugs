Expected behavior\r\nThe `ansible_local` provisioner should install Ansible on the Arch Linux box.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nVagrant fails to install Ansible on the box and bails out. This used to work with Vagrant 2.2.4 against the very same box.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a `playbook.yml` files alongside the `Vagrantfile`. This can even be empty: Ansible will fail when trying to execute it but this will prove that it was installed at least;\r\n2. `vagrant up` the provided `Vagrantfile`.","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11048/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
