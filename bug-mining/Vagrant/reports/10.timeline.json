The following\nchanges have been made to address the situation:\n1. Create a DownloadMixins module to provide the --insecure, --cacert, --capth,\n   and --cert command line options to all of `vagrant box add`,\n   `vagrant box update`, and `vagrant box outdated`.\n2. Extend `Vagrant::Box.has_update?` and `Vagrant::Box.load_metadata` to accept\n   said download options.\n3. Extend `box outdated` and `box update` commands to pass download options\n   down.\n4. Extend `Vagrant::Builtin::Action::BoxCheckOutdated` to honour download\n   options.\n5. Options specified on the command line take precedence over options specified\n   in the machine configuration, if any.\n6.
