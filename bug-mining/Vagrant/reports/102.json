However, After system upgraded, I found my vagrant command had broken. Even I uninstall and reinstall both Virtualbox and Vagrant. The result is still the same. \r\n\r\nSince I can turn on my guest VM on Virtualbox, I guess the root cause is something wrong with Vagrant. Does anyone have the same problem as mine?\r\n\r\nPS. I can still use `vagrant -v` to get the version info. But when I use `vagrant`, I just get the following error messages.\r\n\r\nλ vagrant\r\nC:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:208:in `downcase': input string invalid (ArgumentError)\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:208:in `block (2 levels) in fs_real_path'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:207:in `each'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:207:in `block in fs_real_path'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:206:in `each'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:206:in `fs_real_path'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/environment.rb:121:in `initialize'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/bin/vagrant:118:in `new'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/bin/vagrant:118:in `<main>'\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\nVagrant 2.0.1\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nWindows 10 version 1709\r\nWith VirtualBox-5.2.4-119785-Win.exe\r\nAnd Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.2.4-119785.vbox-extpack\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/chonhan/78a59432b199e8ff22f0b6a3e4a0589f\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n$ vagrant\r\nUsage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]\r\n\r\n    -v, --version                    Print the version and exit.\r\n    -h, --help                       Print this help.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nλ vagrant\r\nC:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:208:in `downcase': input string invalid (ArgumentError)\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:208:in `block (2 levels) in fs_real_path'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:207:in `each'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:207:in `block in fs_real_path'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:206:in `each'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/util/platform.rb:206:in `fs_real_path'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/environment.rb:121:in `initialize'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/bin/vagrant:118:in `new'\r\n        from C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/bin/vagrant:118:in `<main>'\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.
