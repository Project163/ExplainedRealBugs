currently have two issues with the snapshot restore functionality. They may both be simple lack of education, improper workflow, etc., I don't know. I'm looking, but cannot find the answers so far.\n## The Setup\n1. I setup my Vagrantfile, including provisioning to get my machine close to how I need it\n2. I `vagrant up`\n3. I make final manual adjustments to get things \"just so\"\n4. I shut the machine down with `vagrant halt machineName`\n5. I use `vagrant snapshot save machineName snapshotName` and that works great too.\n## Expectations\n\nWhen I use `vagrant snapshot restore machineName snapshotName` there are two things that happen that I did not expect/want:\n1. The machine actually boots up. I don't want it to that. I want it to restore and then await further use. I had previously taken the snapshot in a halted state. I expect the restore of the snapshot to put the machine back to the same state it was in when I took the snapshot (a.k.a., halted).\n2. Provisioning occurs. I tried adding --no-provision, but that didn't seem to help. The snapshot is exactly how I wanted the machine.  The provisioning happened earlier when I did my original vagrant up. I don' want provisioning to occur again.\n\nSo I expect I may have different/unusual expectations or lack knowledge of a command line switch to use etc.  Anyway, let he debate begin.\n\nThanks,\nJason\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6752/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
