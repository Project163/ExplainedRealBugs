Perhaps a more accurate message such as \"Unpacking necessary files from:\" would suffice for boxes beginning with file://.\n### Steps to reproduce:\n\n```\nvagrant init file:///home/user/Software/VirtualMachines/VagrantBoxes/anyBox.box\nvagrant up\n```\n### Output seen:\n\n```\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\n==> default: Box 'file:///home/user/Software/VirtualMachines/VagrantBoxes/anyBox.box' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...\n    default: Box Provider: virtualbox\n    default: Box Version: >= 0\n==> default: Adding box 'file:///home/user/Software/VirtualMachines/VagrantBoxes/anyBox.box' (v0) for provider: virtualbox\n    **default: Downloading: file:///home/user/Software/VirtualMachines/VagrantBoxes/anyBox.box**\n==> default: Successfully added box 'file:///home/user/Software/VirtualMachines/VagrantBoxes/anyBox.box' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!\n==> default: Importing base box 'file:///home/user/Software/VirtualMachines/VagrantBoxes/anyBox.box'...\n```\n\nIf one runs iotop its clear that the process \"bsdtar -v -x\" is doing a ton of read / writes to disk.\nNethogs also shows zero packets being transferred.\n\nThis message is almost certainly an artifact of a previously download-only implementation--and I'm sure most of us can gather that immediately.  For others, not needing to worry that their system is importing the wrong box might be of use! \n\nThanks for the great project!\n","closed_by":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
