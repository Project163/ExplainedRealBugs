is reporting errors in `Vagrantfile` inconsistently and in some cases, the `Vagrantfile` path and the error line number are reported wrong.\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\n2.2.5 (64-bit)\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64-bit\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\nI have tested 4 different contents of the `Vagrantfile`. All of them contain an error of using an undefined variable or a syntax error, each time in a different scope, each time producing different (and in 2 cases wrong) `Vagrantfile` path and error line number report.\r\n\r\n#### Case 1\r\n```ruby\r\nvb.memory = \"4096\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Case 2\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n  vb.memory = \"4096\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Case 3\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n  config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |vb|\r\n      xvb.memory = \"4096\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Case 4\r\n```ruby\r\n# test\r\nabcd(\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nBoth the `Vagrantfile` path and the error line number are properly reported and ideally in the same format.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n#### Case 1\r\nIn this case, both the `Vagrantfile` path and the error line number are properly reported:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant status\r\nVagrant failed to initialize at a very early stage:\r\n\r\nThere was an error loading a Vagrantfile. The file being loaded\r\nand the error message are shown below. This is usually caused by\r\na syntax error.\r\n\r\nPath: D:/work/memsource/vagrant/Vagrantfile\r\nLine number: 1\r\nMessage: NameError: undefined local variable or method `vb' for main:Object\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Case 2\r\nIn this case, the error line number is reported right, but `Vagrantfile` path is not:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant status\r\nVagrant failed to initialize at a very early stage:\r\n\r\nThere was an error loading a Vagrantfile. The file being loaded\r\nand the error message are shown below. This is usually caused by\r\nan invalid or undefined variable.\r\n\r\nPath: D\r\nLine number: 2\r\nMessage: undefined local variable or method `vb'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Case 3\r\nIn this case, both the `Vagrantfile` path and the error line number seems to be wrong. The path looks like a code block specification where the error occurred and the error line number contains a broken `Vagrantfile` path (the proper path would be `D:/work/memsource/vagrant/Vagrantfile` as reported in the Case 1):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant status\r\nVagrant failed to initialize at a very early stage:\r\n\r\nThere was an error loading a Vagrantfile. The file being loaded\r\nand the error message are shown below. This is usually caused by\r\na syntax error.\r\n\r\nPath: <provider config: virtualbox>\r\nLine number: /work/memsource/vagrant/Vagrantfile\r\nMessage: NameError: undefined local variable or method `xvb' for main:Object\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Case 4\r\nThis time, both `Vagrantfile` path and the error line number are right, but together with the error message, they're reported differently:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ vagrant status\r\nVagrant failed to initialize at a very early stage:\r\n\r\nThere is a syntax error in the following Vagrantfile. The syntax error\r\nmessage is reproduced below for convenience:\r\n\r\nD:/work/memsource/vagrant/Vagrantfile:2: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting ')'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a Vagrantfile\r\n2. Run `vagrant status` in the same directory\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11022/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
