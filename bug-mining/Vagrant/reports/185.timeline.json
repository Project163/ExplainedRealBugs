@chrisroberts and @mitchellh Apologies if this appears obtuse. \r\n\r\nI'm on `Vagrant 1.8.6`\r\n\r\nThe related issues list below indicates that Vagrant private key handling is causing grief - and these issues only represent people who hang in enough to log an issue.\r\n\r\nI think the difficulty is more than with the documentation.  I note that #5005 was tagged as an enhancement... should it have been closed?  I think the enhancement is still required.\r\n\r\n## Scenario\r\nYou want Vagrant to insert the public keys that correspond to a list of private keys you provide.\r\n\r\n## Current behaviour\r\nCurrent behaviour **can be** represented as this default configuration (but I don't think it is implemented like this):\r\n````ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n  config.ssh.insert_key = true\r\n  ...\r\nend\r\n````\r\nand this behaviour:\r\n1. Insert `insecure_private_key` file name in `private_key_path` then insert its public key in the VM's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\r\n2. If no other private key exists in `private_key_path`, generate one and add it to the array\r\n3. Insert the just created key's public key in the VM's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\r\n4. If 3. succeeds then remove the insecure public key from the VM's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\r\n\r\n## Desired behaviour\r\n````ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n  config.ssh.private_key_path = ['~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key',\r\n                                 '~/.aws/private_key']\r\n  config.ssh.insert_key = true\r\nend\r\n````\r\nand this behaviour:\r\n1. For *each* private key in `private_key_path` if `insert_key = true` then generate its public key (`ssh-keygen -y -e -f \"$PRIVKEY\"`) and insert its public key in the VM's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\r\n2. If 1. succeeds and `insecure_private_key` is the name of any file `private_key_path` then remove the insecure public key from the VM's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\r\n\r\n## Current workaround\r\n````ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n\r\n  config.vm.define \"ami\", primary: true do |ami|\r\n      override.ssh.insert_key = false\r\n      override.ssh.username = 'vagrant'\r\n      override.ssh.private_key_path = [ '~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key',\r\n                                        '~/.aws/private_key.pem' ] \r\n\r\n  end\r\n  pub_key = `ssh-keygen -y -e -f '~/.aws/private_key.pem'`\r\n  config.ssh.insert_key = false\r\n  config.vm.provision \"shell\", inline: <<-EOC\r\n    echo '#{pub_key}' >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n    sed --in-place=.bak -r 's/^#?(PermitRootLogin|PermitEmptyPasswords|PasswordAuthentication|X11Forwarding) yes/\\1 no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config\r\n    sed --in-place=.bak '/== vagrant insecure public key$/d' /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n    sed --in-place=.bak '$!N; /^\\(.*\\)\\n\\1$/!P; D' /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys\r\n    sudo service ssh restart\r\n  EOC\r\n  end\r\n  config.vm.provision 'chef_zero' do |chef|\r\n  ...\r\n  end\r\n````\r\n\r\n## Related:\r\n#4707\r\n#4967\r\n#5005 \r\n#5090\r\n#8102

\r\n\r\nIs all about the workflow.\r\n\r\nIf you creare your own VM or AMI using your own pair of keys you should
