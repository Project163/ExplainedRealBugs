...\r\n  config.vm.define 'win' do |win|\r\n    win.vm.box = \"some/win7prosp1box\"\r\n    # ...\r\n    win.vm.provision 'file', source: 'vagrant/firefox-autoconfig.js', destination: 'C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js'\r\n    # ...\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/dusek/a2a77f9ecff823f194496709ba0a8d9f\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n- the `vagrant up` command would not error\r\n- the file on host at `vagrant/firefox-autoconfig.js` would be uploaded on guest at `C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n- the `vagrant up` command errors with:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nmkdir Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences\" -force\r\n...\r\nThe string starting:\r\n+ mkdir Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences <<<< \" -force\r\nis missing the terminator: \".\r\n```\r\n- the file on guest at `C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js` does not exist\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Run `vagrant up win --provision-with file` with the above Vagrantfile (or when the machine is alread created, run `vagrant provision win --provision-with file`, i.e. for repeated testing of Vagrantfile changes)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- Tried escaping the path with one, two, three and four `\\` characters, to no avail.\r\n- Tried placing the `^` character before the space, to no avail.\r\n- Tried changing the destination path to add another non-existent directory `A B`, i.e. `C:/Program Files/A B/Mozilla Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences/autoconfig.js`. This led to the exact same \"point of path split\", i.e. the error message referred to the same failing command `mkdir Firefox/browser/defaults/preferences\" -force`\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- GH-7234\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
