Vagrant [assumes](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/search?q=initctl&type=Code) that an OS uses Upstart if `/sbin/initctl` is present. But this is not always the case, for example `systemd-sysv` Ubuntu package registers systemd as init daemon, but doesn't remove `/sbin/initctl` binary.\n\nThe first workaround I have tried is removing `upstart` and `upstart-bin` packages. This removes `sbin/initctl` binary, but also stops Upstart daemon, breaking `shutdown` (and probably other essential commands) until you hard-reboot the VM.\n\nThe second workaround is `chmod a-x /sbin/initctl`. It works, but obviously is the wrong way of doing things :)\n\nI think Vagrant should ignore errors from this command. Unfortunately, it was copied to non-core plugins, e.g. [vagrant-parallels](https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/blob/ee12f744584d9fad85d99445bafe7775c87d4a1a/lib/vagrant-parallels/guest_cap/linux/mount_parallels_shared_folder.rb#L83), so they need to be fixed
