https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/3670, if I run Vagrant on windows 7, the host max path length is 260 characters at the utter most without special instructions/commands, so when running something that has to make deep directories, like checking out a large software project or doing an `npm install`, causes \"protocol errors\".\n\nFor `npm` in particular this is a problem; on native windows `npm` can make use of UNC paths to get around the path limit, and it works brilliant, but inside a vagrant VM the \"protocol error\" means projects can't be instantiated, and consequently not worked with, effectively negating the benefit that vagrant offers.\n\nI don't know if this is something that can be fixed in Vagrant itself (maybe?) or whether it's a virtualbox issue (I have no other virtualisation software to test that with, unfortunately), but if this can be fixed, that would be amazingly useful for software project virtualisation/testing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/1953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/1953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/63133083","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/4815#issuecomment-63133083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/4815","id":63133083,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMTMzMDgz","user":{"login":"Pomax","id":177243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzI0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax","html_url":"https://github.com/Pomax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pomax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-14T21:39:04Z","updated_at":"2014-11-14T21:39:04Z","body":"Agreed.
