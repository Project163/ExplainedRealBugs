#11254.\r\n\r\nNote that this will only work with boxes that have systemd v244 and above, as I've used `networkctl reload` (https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6654) rather than `systemctl restart systemd-networkd`, since that seems likely to be the least disruptive. If the archlinux box being configured is older than 2019-11-29, though, then it will have systemd v243 (or older) so `networkctl reload` won't exist. So if you want to support archlinux boxes that are more than two months out of date, then edit plugins/guests/arch/cap/configure_networks.rb in this PR and replace the single `networkctl reload` line with `systemctl restart systemd-networkd` instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11400/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/586595448","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11254#issuecomment-586595448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11254","id":586595448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjU5NTQ0OA==","user":{"login":"rmunn","id":90762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn","html_url":"https://github.com/rmunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-15T14:27:14Z","updated_at":"2020-02-15T14:27:14Z","body":"#11400 implements this.

output\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/raqua/cf3a394298f32332393191d06a88ba92\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nArchlinux should be started and provisioned with Salt. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nI get a lot of gem (Ruby?) warnings and provisioning fails with being unable to setup networking.\r\nThis worked fine until box version 2019.10.02, since then it fails.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Run \"vagrant up\" on provided Vagrantfile\r\n2.\r\n3.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11361/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3504417149,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1MDQ0MTcxNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3504417149","actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-01T22:07:36Z","label":{"name":"track-internal","color":"bf9516"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3555262197,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU1NTI2MjE5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3555262197","actor":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-16T21:34:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/674467034","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11254#issuecomment-674467034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11254","id":674467034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDQ2NzAzNA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-16T01:50:25Z","updated_at":"2020-08-16T01:50:25Z","body":"I'm going to lock this issue because it has been closed for _30 days_ ⏳.
