December 24th, 2014, user @gou1 made a comment on  https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5059 that the documentation for `config.ssh` is misleading. This caused @gildegoma to toggle some tags and rename the issue to **Vagrant documentation about default insecure key should be updated**.\r\n\r\nOn July 7th, 2015, the issue was closed and subsequently locked.\r\n\r\nBut, the [documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/ssh_settings.html) was never updated. It is still misleading.\r\n\r\n`config.ssh.insert_key` docs say that this option is true/enabled, by default.\r\n\r\nBut..\r\n\r\n> This only has an effect if you do not already use private keys for authentication or if you are relying on the default insecure key.\r\n\r\nThis sentence is kind of troublesome and my biological parser is either buggy or the exception is legit. Compare these different flavors of this sentence:\r\n\r\ntrue if you do (not a) or b\r\n\r\ntrue if you do not (a or b)\r\n\r\nI vote for the latter: `config.ssh.insert_key` \"has no effect\" if the Vagrant user is \"relying on the default insecure key\".\r\n\r\nScroll up a little bit up on the page. This is what `config.ssh.private_key_path has to say`:\r\n\r\n> By default this is the insecure private key that ships with Vagrant, since that is what public boxes use.\r\n\r\nSo by default, Vagrant use an \"insecure private key\", which the first section we looked claim will render his default \"true\" value useless. Which option overrides the other - so to speak? Either Vagrant will use the insecure private key, or he will insert a newly generated key. Both can not be true. \r\n\r\nAlso note that the `config.ssh.insert_key` section say that Vagrant use two keys (a \"keypair\") to replace just 1.\r\n\r\nI think that these sections need to be reworked. I also think that the community will benefit if Vagrant addressed SSH and SSH security in more detail. Currently, we have basically only 1 page that target each and every setting in `config.ssh` one after another in a list-like fashion without providing the user with an introduction/overview.","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8058/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8058/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
