Install Vagrant from https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.4/vagrant_1.9.4.msi\r\n3. `vagrant up`\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- I can use Virtualbox to install an ISO manually as well as use the resulting machine\r\n- I just downloaded both tools today.\r\n- I tried messing with `config.vm.boot_timeout` but that didn't help\r\n- I disabled my antivirus (Avast) but that didn't seem to make a difference\r\n\r\n### Truncated Error\r\nFor Github searchability\r\n```\r\nvagrant.exe : C:/HashiCorp/Vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/net-ssh-4.1.0/lib/net/ssh/transport/server_version.rb:54:in `readpartial': An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine. \r\n(Errno::ECONNABORTED)\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ & vagrant up 2>&1 >> log.txt\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (C:/HashiCorp/Va...::ECONNABORTED):String) [], RemoteException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError\r\n```\r\n\r\n### References\r\nAre there any other GitHub issues (open or closed) that should be linked here?\r\nFor example:\r\n- GH-7832 look kind of similar (`read_nonblock` instead of `readpartial` and `vagrant share` instead of `vagrant up`)\r\n- ...\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8520/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
