I think that the easy solution here is to add a \"rescue\" block to catch failures while waiting for reboot and assume that the reboot is then in progress. \r\nThere are two obvious places to put this. One could place the error handling within `change_host_name.rb` which would fix this issue specifically. However it seems like it could probably better go in `vagrant\\plugins\\guests\\windows\\cap\\reboot.rb` where it would handle any possible race condition in other places that are waiting for a reboot.  Places that use the `wait_for_reboot` capability include:\r\nvagrant\\plugins\\provisioners\\chef\\provisioner\\chef_client.rb -> run_chef_client\r\nvagrant\\plugins\\provisioners\\chef\\provisioner\\chef_solo.rb -> run_chef_solo\r\nvagrant\\plugins\\provisioners\\chef\\provisioner\\chef_zero.rb -> run_chef_zero\r\nvagrant\\plugins\\provisioners\\chef\\provisioner\\puppet.rb -> provision\r\nvagrant\\plugins\\provisioners\\shell\\provisioner.rb -> provision_winrm\r\n\r\nAny thoughts about why the error handling should or shouldn't be in reboot.rb?

made a pull request that addresses this issue: https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/pull/10347\r\n\r\nBasically Vagrant attempted to figure out the guests `ssh_info` after the machine was requested to reboot. If the guest isn't up yet, the powershell script `get_network_config.ps1` fails and raises an exception. I've added some retry logic to continue to query for the guests IP until it's available. The timeout can be configured with an existing option that's used else where when first booting up the
