Randomly found this out when attempting to stand up the environment just so I could check a quick assumption. \r\n\r\n```\r\nkevin@helios:~/dev/securedrop$ vagrant up /staging/\r\nBringing machine 'mon-staging' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\r\nBringing machine 'app-staging' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\r\n==> mon-staging: Checking if box 'bento/ubuntu-14.04' is up to date...\r\n==> mon-staging: There was a problem while downloading the metadata for your box\r\n==> mon-staging: to check for updates. This is not an error, since it is usually due\r\n==> mon-staging: to temporary network problems. This is just a warning. The problem\r\n==> mon-staging: encountered was:\r\n==> mon-staging: \r\n==> mon-staging: The requested URL returned error: 404 Not Found\r\n==> mon-staging: \r\n==> mon-staging: If you want to check for box updates, verify your network connection\r\n==> mon-staging: is valid and try again.\r\nYour VM has become \"inaccessible.\" Unfortunately, this is a critical error\r\nwith VirtualBox that Vagrant can not cleanly recover from.
