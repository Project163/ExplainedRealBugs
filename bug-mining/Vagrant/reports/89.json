Vagrant version\r\n1.9.5\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nOS X 10.12.4\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nDebian 8\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nVagrant should quote Ansible host variables when generating an inventory file.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nIt doesn't, and then pukes.\r\n\r\n### More Info\r\n\r\nWhen generating the Ansible host file, I'm using \"host_vars\" like so...\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  cfg.vm.provision :ansible do |a|\r\n    a.host_vars = ansible_host_vars\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is, it's not quoting strings that should be quoted...generating something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncb-beta-app-1 ansible_ssh_host=173.255.247.7 ansible_ssh_port=22 hostname=cb-beta-app-1 vpn_hostname=vpn_app_1 vpn_ip=10.0.0.20 datacenter=fremont linode_plan=Linode 2048\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last variable there \"linode_plan\" should be quoted. The space inside throws off ```vagrant provision``` and causes the following errors with Ansible:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR! Attempted to read \"/Users/seth/Work/cashboard/app/.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory\" as YAML: 'AnsibleUnicode' object has no attribute 'keys'\r\nAttempted to read \"/Users/seth/Work/cashboard/app/.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory\" as ini file: /Users/seth/Work/cashboard/app/.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory:2: Expected key=value host variable assignment, got: 2048\r\nAnsible failed to complete successfully. Any error output should be\r\nvisible above. Please fix these errors and try again.\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"gildegoma","id":434654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDY1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma","html_url":"https://github.com/gildegoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
