6.1.0 has been released. Unfortunately, Vagrant 2.2.6 doesn't work with this new release. This isn't an issue with this repository, but it may affect people using these boxes. It should be fixed in the next release of Vagrant (see [https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11249](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11249)), but here's how to work around the problem in the meantime.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n- @scoter-oracle [blogged about a very similar issue last year](https://blogs.oracle.com/scoter/getting-vagrant-220-working-with-virtualbox-60-beta1).\r\n- @briancain has developed a fix for the next Vagrant release (see [https://github.com/briancain/vagrant/commit/fb4e6985e142da56bad143d70600cd3695c91757](https://github.com/briancain/vagrant/commit/fb4e6985e142da56bad143d70600cd3695c91757))\r\n\r\nThe workaround requires 3 changes.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the file `/opt/vagrant/embedded/gems/2.2.6/gems/vagrant-2.2.6/plugins/providers/virtualbox/plugin.rb`, add a line at the end of the Driver module for VirtualBox 6.1, as follows. (On Windows, the file location is `C:\\HashiCorp\\Vagrant\\embedded\\gems\\2.2.6\\gems\\vagrant-2.2.6\\plugins\\providers\\virtualbox\\plugin.rb`.)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule Driver\r\n  autoload :Meta, File.expand_path(\"../driver/meta\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_4_0, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_4_0\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_4_1, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_4_1\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_4_2, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_4_2\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_4_3, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_4_3\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_5_0, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_5_0\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_5_1, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_5_1\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_5_2, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_5_2\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_6_0, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_6_0\", __FILE__)\r\n  autoload :Version_6_1, File.expand_path(\"../driver/version_6_1\", __FILE__)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, in the file `/opt/vagrant/embedded/gems/2.2.6/gems/vagrant-2.2.6/plugins/providers/virtualbox/driver/meta.rb`, add a line at the end of the driver_map section for VirtualBox 6.1, as follows. (On Windows, the file location is `C:\\HashiCorp\\Vagrant\\embedded\\gems\\2.2.6\\gems\\vagrant-2.2.6\\plugins\\providers\\virtualbox\\driver\\meta.rb`.)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndriver_map   = {\r\n  \"4.0\" => Version_4_0,\r\n  \"4.1\" => Version_4_1,\r\n  \"4.2\" => Version_4_2,\r\n  \"4.3\" => Version_4_3,\r\n  \"5.0\" => Version_5_0,\r\n  \"5.1\" => Version_5_1,\r\n  \"5.2\" => Version_5_2,\r\n  \"6.0\" => Version_6_0,\r\n  \"6.1\" => Version_6_1,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, create a **new** file called `version_6_1.rb` in the directory `/opt/vagrant/embedded/gems/2.2.6/gems/vagrant-2.2.6/plugins/providers/virtualbox/driver`. (On Windows, create this file in the folder `C:\\HashiCorp\\Vagrant\\embedded\\gems\\2.2.6\\gems\\vagrant-2.2.6\\plugins\\providers\\virtualbox\\driver`.) In this new file, paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briancain/vagrant/fb4e6985e142da56bad143d70600cd3695c91757/plugins/providers/virtualbox/driver/version_6_1.rb).\r\n\r\nWith these 3 changes, Vagrant 2.2.6 will work with VirtualBox 6.1.0.

all!\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks so much for bringing this issue and new VirtualBox release to our attention.\r\n\r\nWe have considered being looser as to which VirtualBox versions we support, but ideally we would rather have folks on an older version of VirtualBox and see this unsupported message temporarily rather than run into frustrating or unusual errors from a cutting edge release. By doing this, it gives us at least a bit of time to make sure the most basic operations between VirtualBox and Vagrant work before pushing out a release that supports the new version. This isn't the most ideal solution for users who like being on the cutting edge, but generally we believe a warning is a better user experience than an unexpected exception.\r\n\r\nFor now, you all are free to run Vagrant from source if you really wish to be on the cutting edge of what Vagrant supports with VirtualBox. But as far as what we are supporting in Vagrant inside an official package, we might be a few weeks behind releasing support for VirtualBox 6.1. Sorry about that!\r\nAgain, we really appreciate you all letting us know so quickly, so thanks again! :heart: ","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/565214999/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/565229135","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11249#issuecomment-565229135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11249","id":565229135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTIyOTEzNQ==","user":{"login":"scoter-oracle","id":25104914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA0OTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25104914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle","html_url":"https://github.com/scoter-oracle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scoter-oracle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T23:14:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T23:14:36Z","body":"@briancain target of my comment was a sort of proposal to anticipate this kind of issue.\r\nVirtualBox 6.1 BETA-1 had been announced ~Sept. 2019......and GA release Dec. 11th; during this time we could think to work together (I'm PM for Linux and Virtualization at Oracle) to possibly avoid this kind of problem for the VirtualBox GA release.

This does not seem like a clean way of handling upgrades, though.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative may just be that the vagrant Chocolatey package needs to be dependent on specific versions of virtualbox instead of addressing this in vagrant itself.
