race condition in the rename host procedure causes the provisioning to fail.\r\nThis is a specific case of the error described in issue #9356. I've created a separate case because the cause of #9356 is somewhat ambiguous and is likely caused by more than one scenario. This case only deals with errors caused while waiting for a reboot after renaming the machine during a provisioning of a Windows guest.\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\nVagrant 2.1.5\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nWindows 10 Pro Version 1803 Build 17134.286\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nWindows 7 Enterprise with SP1\r\n\r\n###Provider\r\nHyper-V\r\n\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# -*- mode: ruby -*-\r\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\r\n\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n  config.vm.box = \"win7-sc-base\"\r\n  config.vm.box_url = \"#{INTERNAL_VAGRANT_SHARE}/win7-sc-base.json\"\r\n  \r\n  config.vm.define \"kiosk1\" do |kiosk1|\r\n    kiosk1.vm.hostname = \"VM-Kiosk1\"\r\n  end #kiosk1\r\n\r\n  config.vm.network \"public_network\"\r\n\r\n  config.vm.provider :hyperv do |v, override|\r\n    v.memory = 2048\r\n    v.cpus = 2\r\n    v.ip_address_timeout = 130\r\n    v.differencing_disk = true\r\n    v.enable_virtualization_extensions = true\r\n    v.vm_integration_services = {\r\n      guest_service_interface: true,\r\n      heartbeat: true,\r\n      key_value_pair_exchange: true,\r\n      shutdown: true,\r\n      time_synchronization: true,\r\n      vss: true\r\n    }\r\n  end #hyperv\r\n\r\n  # timeout of waiting for image to stop running - may be a deprecated setting\r\n  config.windows.halt_timeout = 20\r\n \r\n  config.vm.guest = :windows\r\n  config.vm.communicator = \"winrm\"\r\n\r\n  config.winrm.username = \"REDACTED\"\r\n  config.winrm.password = \"REDACTED\"\r\n  config.winrm.transport = :negotiate\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\n[Log 1: PowerShellError](https://gist.github.com/General-Fault/4579642973c9722d37601744f8203a41)\r\n[Log 2: ExecutionError](https://gist.github.com/General-Fault/5a77aac61f8dffddf4dc0ce9ecabe963).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nProvisioning a VM with a `vm.hostname` parameter should not fail. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nOccasionally the reboot occurs more quickly that Vagrant can start the reboot listener. As a result the provisioning script fails.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a VagrantFile for a Windows guest with a Hyper-V provider.\r\n2. Add config.vm.hostname = \"new-hostname\" to the VagrantFile\r\n3. On a Windows 10 host, \"up\" the guest.\r\n\r\n4. As part of the provision process, the rename operation schedules a reboot with a 5 second delay.\r\n```\r\n[10:28:48.628] DEBUG winrmshell: [WinRM] Command created for $computer = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem\r\n$retval = $computer.rename(\"new-hostname\").returnvalue\r\nif ($retval -eq 0) {\r\nshutdown /r /t 5 /f /d p:4:1 /c \"Vagrant Rename Computer\"\r\n}\r\nexit $retval\r\n```\r\n\r\nImmediately after, it attempts to wait for the reboot\r\n```\r\n            if machine.guest.capability?(:wait_for_reboot)\r\n                machine.guest.capability(:wait_for_reboot)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the wait_for_reboot step process takes more than 5 seconds to initialize, as it often does, this call can fail.\r\n\r\n5. If the guest is successfully provisioned, repeat the test until the provision fails.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThe error is usually a `VagrantPlugins::HyperV::Errors::PowerShellError` with the message \"Failed to determine IP address\". [detail](https://gist.github.com/General-Fault/4579642973c9722d37601744f8203a41) \r\nHowever the race can fail at later steps and generate other errors. At least one other observed instance resulted in a `VagrantPlugins::CommunicatorWinRM::Errors::ExecutionError` [detail](https://gist.github.com/General-Fault/5a77aac61f8dffddf4dc0ce9ecabe963).\r\n\r\nIn instances where the provisioning is successful, the next get-ipaddress occurs within that 5 seconds. In instances where the provisioning fails, that time is longer (or I suspect Windows is taking longer to shutdown). The IP address check seems to be a part of asking windows for a shutdown event. So it's just late.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nA workaround is to increase the delay to 15 seconds (in Vagrant\\embedded\\gems\\2.1.5\\gems\\vagrant-2.1.5\\plugins\\guests\\windows\\cap\\change_host_name.rb:20 - see below). But I think that a better solution here would be to assume that a failed IP address meant that the system had already started the shutdown, and continue normally.\r\n\r\n          script = <<-EOH\r\n            $computer = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_ComputerSystem\r\n            $retval = $computer.rename(\"#{name}\").returnvalue\r\n            if ($retval -eq 0) {\r\n              shutdown /r /t 15 /f /d p:4:1 /c \"Vagrant Rename Computer\"\r\n            }\r\n            exit $retval\r\n          EOH\r\n\r\n\r\n### References\r\nSee also issue #9356.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
