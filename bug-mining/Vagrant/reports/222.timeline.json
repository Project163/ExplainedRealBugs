investigating dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest#387 and dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest#391 I've found, that vagrant 2.2.11 somehow changed the way plugin can hook before other actions.\r\n\r\nI didn't noticed this earlier since my local dev bundle still pointed to the old \"master\" branch (v2.2.11.dev).\r\n\r\nHere's whats going on:\r\n\r\nFor historic, backwards compatibility reasons vbguest has those 7 year old lines in it's plugin definitions:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule VagrantVbguest\r\n  class Plugin < Vagrant.plugin(\"2\")\r\n    # ...\r\n    action_hook('vbguest') do |hook|\r\n      if defined?(VagrantPlugins::ProviderVirtualBox::Action::CheckGuestAdditions)\r\n        hook.before(VagrantPlugins::ProviderVirtualBox::Action::CheckGuestAdditions, VagrantVbguest::Middleware)\r\n      else\r\n        hook.after(VagrantPlugins::ProviderVirtualBox::Action::Boot, VagrantVbguest::Middleware)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I can change to hook like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\naction_hook('vbguest', :machine_action_up) do |hook|\r\n  require 'vagrant-vbguest/middleware'\r\n  hook.append(VagrantVbguest::Middleware)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a small sample, this seems to be working. Although it will now run after Vagrants own `CheckGuestAdditions`.\r\nI'm not sure if using the `machine_action_up` hook makes sure, that vbguest runs before anything else tries to run which would require working guest additions.\r\n\r\nWhat's your take on this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fnordfish","id":12839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish","html_url":"https://github.com/fnordfish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T15:59:38Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T15:59:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/391","id":742382327,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NDIzODIzMjc=","number":391,"title":"vbguest

using Vagrant 2.2.13 with Virtualbox 6.1.6 (r140961) on Windows 10 1909 (18363.1198) and I'm having trouble getting the plugin (v0.26.0) to work since my update from Vagrant 2.2.10.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample Vagrantfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n  config.vm.box = \"centos/7\"\r\n  config.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"/vagrant\", type: \"virtualbox\"\r\n  config.vbguest.auto_update = true\r\n  config.vbguest.installer_options = { allow_kernel_upgrade: true }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the output of a `vagrant up` on this Vagrantfile:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\r\n==> default: Importing base box 'centos/7'...\r\n==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...\r\n==> default: Checking if box 'centos/7' version '2004.01' is up to date...\r\n==> default: Setting the name of the VM: test_default_1605265863064_13269\r\n==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...\r\n==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...\r\n    default: Adapter 1: nat\r\n==> default: Forwarding ports...\r\n    default: 22 (guest) => 2200 (host) (adapter 1)\r\n==> default: Booting VM...\r\n==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...\r\n    default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2200\r\n    default: SSH username: vagrant\r\n    default: SSH auth method: private key\r\n    default:\r\n    default: Vagrant insecure key detected. Vagrant will automatically replace\r\n    default: this with a newly generated keypair for better security.\r\n    default:\r\n    default: Inserting generated public key within guest...\r\n    default: Removing insecure key from the guest if it's present...\r\n    default: Key inserted! Disconnecting and reconnecting using new SSH key...\r\n==> default: Machine booted and ready!\r\n==> default: Checking for guest additions in VM...\r\n    default: No guest additions were detected on the base box for this VM! Guest\r\n    default: additions are required for forwarded ports, shared folders, host only\r\n    default: networking, and more. If SSH fails on this machine, please install\r\n    default: the guest additions and repackage the box to continue.\r\n    default:\r\n    default: This is not an error message; everything may continue to work properly,\r\n    default: in which case you may ignore this message.\r\n==> default: Mounting shared folders...\r\n    default: /vagrant => C:/Users/Victor.BOUVIERDELEAU/Downloads/test\r\nVagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders. This is usually\r\nbecause the filesystem \"vboxsf\" is not available. This filesystem is\r\nmade available via the VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module.\r\nPlease verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the\r\nguest. This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty\r\nVagrant box. For context, the command attempted was:\r\n\r\nmount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 vagrant /vagrant\r\n\r\nThe error output from the command was:\r\n\r\nmount: unknown filesystem type 'vboxsf'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the plugin was not called by Vagrant!\r\n\r\nIf I run `vagrant vbguest --status` I get:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[default] No Virtualbox Guest Additions installation found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd manual installation using `vagrant vbguest --do install` does work so I'm tempted to say that this is a regression in Vagrant itself, are you able to confirm that? If it's the case then I will open an issue on their repo!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your work!\r\n\r\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that I did this test without any `Vagrantfile` in my `~/.vagrant.d` overriding anything.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/391/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/issues/391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/728156434","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12035#issuecomment-728156434","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12035","id":728156434,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODE1NjQzNA==","user":{"login":"fnordfish","id":12839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish","html_url":"https://github.com/fnordfish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fnordfish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-16T16:03:18Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T16:03:18Z","body":"@chrisroberts 157db399 seems to fix vagrant-vbguest as well.
