We've gone through and replicated setups you've described using the changes in #12037 and everything appears to be working as expected. Just to address two things you noted:\r\n\r\n> when using vagrant up --provision the pre-provision trigger is not ran\r\n\r\nThis is expected behavior for the default triggers implementation. Triggers are based on the command being run, not the action. With a trigger defined for `:provision`, it will _only_ run when the `vagrant provision` command is run. You can define multiple commands for the trigger to run on (`[:up, :provision]`) if that's the desired behavior.\r\n\r\n> the vagrant-goodhosts plugins output appears multiple times\r\n\r\nI experienced this output as well, and looking at the plugin setup it _is_ expected based on the hooks usage, however it was likely not previously happening based on the original issues of not all hooks being triggered. \r\n\r\nIf you have any other issues/questions with this, please let me know. Otherwise, we should have the new release out soon which includes this fix.
