@sethvargo Here is my attempt to implement #2103. My idea is to try to get it merged into 1.8 Milestone.\n\nI created the branch directly in original repository, so that you can directly add things by your own (especially to quickly fix my English and Ruby mistakes, sorry in advance :sweat_smile:). I am looking forward to receiving your comments :grinning: !\n#### The `ansible_local` Provisioner (new feature)\n\nI'd be **very thankful to the interested Vagrant users to check the current design and report as soon as possible if their needs wouldn't be satisfied**, so we can adapt before this first release.\n\nNote that the Ansible Installation Capability is already available for the following platforms (using the distribution package system (e.g. apt, yum, pacman, freebsd pkg, etc):\n- Debian 6+ (package is officially available as of jessie, with backports for wheezy. Older versions won't be supported).\n- Ubuntu 12.04+ (package is officially available as of Trusty, but it is preferable to use the official PPA from Ansible Inc.)\n- RedHat-6+ family via EPEL repository (validated on Fedora20, CentOS 6 & 7, OracleLinux 6 & 7)\n- ArchLinux (package is officially available)\n- OpenSUSE 13.2+ (package is officially available as of 13.2)\n- FreeBSD 10+ (package is officially available as of 10.0)\n##### Open Questions\n\nDiscussed via code comments on this GitHub pull request.\n##### Missing Features\n\nThe following functions are intentionally not developed in this initial version (but might be considered in future development iterations):\n- Automated installation of a specific Ansible version (e.g. via pip packaging).\n  \n  Reasons: Lack of user feedback, experience to confirm this need. User still can build their own base box.\n#### The `ansible` Provisioner\n\nBy keeping the existing unit test coverage almost unchanged, I'm quite confident that the refactored `ansible` provisioner still behave the same (a.k.a free from new bugs!). I only added a few minor things that I hit on my coding path (Windows warning, and a buggy behavior when `VAGRANT_LOG` is not defined).\n#### The Documentation\n\nMany changes are also proposed here. I mainly tried to cut the things in four separate pages with the goal to help user to quickly find the relevant information:\n- a common page to introduce how Ansible is integrated in Vagrant (ansible_intro)\n- a common page to list the common options (ansible_common)\n- a short page to quick start with `ansible` provisioner, with specific tips and tricks\n- a short page to quick start with `ansible_local` provisioner, with specific tips and tricks\n\nLike for the code, I'm open to any other way to organize the things... just let me know what do you think.\n#### Finalization Check-List\n- [ ] #2718: Add Galaxy Support\n- [ ] Reintegrate changes related to #5531, #5551, #5803, #5765, #6209, #6348\n- [ ] Integration/Regression Tests on Linux, Mac and Windows hosts\n- [ ] Documentation reviewed :passport_control:\n- [ ] All open questions and doubts are closed.\n- [ ] Freeze provisioner naming: `ansible_local`, or `ansible_on_guest`, or ...?\n- [ ] Improve/Align Ruby style\n- [ ] Remove all `TODO`s (fix them or create new GitHub issues for later work)\n- [ ] Code freeze and add the new unit tests, (for `ansible_local` coverage, following http://betterspecs.org styling?)\n#### CHANGELOG entries\n\n```\n## 1.8.0 (unreleased)\n\nFEATURES:\n\n  - provisioners/ansible_local: New provisioner to execute Ansible from the guest machine [GH-5340]\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n  - provisioners/ansible: Warn when running from a Windows Host [GH-5292]\n\nBUGS:\n\n  - provisioners/ansible: don't show the `ansible-playbook` command when verbose option is an empty string\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3207937084,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MzIwNzkzNzA4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3207937084","actor":null,"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-07T02:31:09Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
