of all, part of this is very similar (possibly the same) to #4152, but with another issue.\n\nThe minion_config file does not get copied to the Windows guest upon installation. Well, it \"does\", but it copies before the salt-minion installation and then the installation overwrites the file. So, the copy isn't doing anything, really. But, I've put a workaround in my Vagrantfile and I've hit another issue.\n\nWorkaround:\n\n```\nif cfg[:saltprovision]\n  then    vm_config.vm.provision :salt do |salt|\n    salt.minion_config      = \"./minion.conf\"\n  end\nend\nif cfg[:saltprovision] and cfg[:osFam] == 'win'\n  then\n    vm_config.vm.provision :shell, inline: \"Copy-Item 'C:\\\\tmp\\\\minion' 'C:\\\\salt\\\\conf\\\\'\"\n    vm_config.vm.provision :shell, inline: \"Restart-Service salt-minion\"\n    vm_config.vm.provision :shell, inline: \"C:\\\\salt\\\\salt-call state.highstate\"\nend\n```\n\nminion_config file:\n\n```\nmaster: 10.10.2.9 \nfile_client: remote\n```\n\nThe minion_id is not defined in the minion_config file, so it should use the hostname. To determine the hostname, salt-minion runs `net config server` and then pulls the `hostname` variable. However, the output of this command is the hostname _before_ the `hostname` is set by Vagrant. Below is the output of `net config server` on the Windows guest:\n\n```\nxerxes:vagrant zane$ vagrant winrm <GUEST> -c 'net config server'\nServer Name                           \\\\WIN--0 [OLD HOSTNAME - PRE VAGRANT]\nServer Comment\n\nSoftware version                      Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard\nServer is active on\n    NetbiosSmb (WIN--0)\n    NetBT_Tcpip_{1F81F14F-241F-4EF8-8085-9FBDB1C71AC6} (WIN--0)\n\n\nServer hidden                         No\nMaximum Logged On Users               16777216\nMaximum open files per session        16384\n\nIdle session time (min)               15\nThe command completed successfully.\n```\n\nIt seems that the `hostname` commands that run to set the hostname on Windows guests are leaving out a registry entry or something and thus the `net config server` command returns the incorrect name.\n\nBelow is the --debug log for Vagrant. Keep in mind that this is just the `vagrant provision --debug <GUEST>` command. If you need the full `vagrant up` please let me know. \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/zmingee/faaa3e161da417c50a13\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":246484935,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI0NjQ4NDkzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/246484935","actor":{"login":"Jamezz","id":2925904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjU5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2925904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz","html_url":"https://github.com/Jamezz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jamezz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2f4a0af5d13e24e2a019130dd6a84ecb10f36b21","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jamezz/vagrant/commits/2f4a0af5d13e24e2a019130dd6a84ecb10f36b21","created_at":"2015-03-05T02:11:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/102139033","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/4152#issuecomment-102139033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/4152","id":102139033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMjEzOTAzMw==","user":{"login":"obestwalter","id":263007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzAwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter","html_url":"https://github.com/obestwalter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/obestwalter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-14T19:03:15Z","updated_at":"2015-05-14T19:03:15Z","body":"Is there any progress on that? \n\nThis bug together with a handful of others in both projects, mean that salt + vagrant on windows is broken for about a year now.
