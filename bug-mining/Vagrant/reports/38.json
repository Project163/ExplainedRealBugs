Would be nice to just add `Vagrant::Util::FileChecksum` to validate the downloaded files. SHA-256 checksums for VirtualBox files are available at https://www.virtualbox.org/download/hashes/5.0.10/SHA256SUMS.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitchellh","id":1299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh","html_url":"https://github.com/mitchellh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6611/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
