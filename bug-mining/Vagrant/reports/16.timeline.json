However I don't think it's really needed. However, here's the command that vagrant used to start ansible during `ansible provision`:\n\n```\nPYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=false ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS='-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s' ansible-playbook --private-key=/path/to/project/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key --user=vagrant --connection=ssh --limit='default' --inventory-file=/path/to/project/.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory --sudo provisioning/setup.yml\n```\n\nNote that `-o IdentitiesOnly=yes` is missing from it.\n\nThe Vagrantfile is as follows\n\n```\n# -*- mode: ruby -*-\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\n\n# Vagrantfile API/syntax version. Don't touch unless you know what you're doing!\nVAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = \"2\"\n\nVagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|\n  config.vm.box = \"debian77\"\n  config.vm.box_url = \"http://opscode-vm-bento.s3.amazonaws.com/vagrant/virtualbox/opscode_debian-7.7_chef-provisionerless.box\"\n\n  config.vm.provision \"ansible\" do |ansible|\n    ansible.sudo = true\n    ansible.playbook = \"provisioning/setup.yml\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIf you connect with vagrant ssh, you'll see this line (with IdentitiesOnly=yes):\n\n```\nINFO ssh: Invoking SSH: [\"vagrant@127.0.0.1\", \"-p\", \"2222\", \"-o\", \"Compression=yes\", \"-o\", \"DSAAuthentication=yes\", \"-o\", \"LogLevel=FATAL\", \"-o\", \"StrictHostKeyChecking=no\", \"-o\", \"UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\", \"-o\", \"IdentitiesOnly=yes\", \"-i\", \"/path/to/project/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key\"]\n```\n\nIf you're not familiar with `IdentitiesOnly`, this is the documentation on it:\n\n> **IdentitiesOnly**\n> Specifies that ssh(1) should only use the authentication identity files configured in the ssh_config files, even if ssh-agent(1) offers more identities. The argument to this keyword must be ''yes'' or ''no''. This option is intended for situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities. The default is ''no''. \n\nThe implication without `IdentitiesOnly=yes` is that if the user has more than something like 5 ssh keys, it will offer them all in some order (I'm not sure how it is ordered) to the server. After 5 keys, the connection will fail with too many authentication failures. \n\nSo the simple workaround is adding `IdentitiesOnly=yes` to the raw_ssh_args for ansible in the Vagrantfile, but it would be nice to have vagrant do this itself, as it already does this for vagrant ssh. I'm not familiar enough with Vagrant's code base to pinpoint where the best location is to add this. I've found [this](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/a3a41fe3bcebb203e63bc17a3faf82c307c9d562/plugins/provisioners/ansible/provisioner.rb#L212-L232), but I'm not sure if that's the correct location to add this argument.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/67423823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shuhaowu","id":338100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODEwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/338100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu","html_url":"https://github.com/shuhaowu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuhaowu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/67443079","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5017#issuecomment-67443079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5017","id":67443079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDQzMDc5","user":{"login":"gildegoma","id":434654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDY1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma","html_url":"https://github.com/gildegoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-18T05:30:17Z","updated_at":"2014-12-18T05:30:17Z","body":"@shuhaowu thanks for all the details of your report, that's very useful to speed up all the things.

When running the ansible provisioner with `vagrant provision` I do not see the settings I am passing through to ansible.extra_vars in the debug information.\n\nThis is the config I am using:\n\n```\n  config.vm.provision \"ansible\" do |ansible|\n    ansible.playbook = \"provisioning/playbook.yml\"\n    ansible.inventory_path = \"provisioning/ansible_hosts\"\n    ansible.host_key_checking = false\n    ansible.sudo = true\n    ansible.limit = 'all'\n    ansible.verbose = 'vvvv'\n    ansible.extra_vars = {ansible_ssh_args: '-o ForwardAgent=yes'}\n  end\n```\n\nIt does not seem to `ansible.extra_vars` is commented out or not I still receive the following debug info:\n\n```\n<192.168.56.122> ESTABLISH CONNECTION FOR USER: vagrant\n<192.168.56.122> REMOTE_MODULE setup\n<192.168.56.122> EXEC ssh -C -tt -vvv -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s -o ControlPath=\"/home/cgsmith/.ansible/cp/ansible-ssh-%h-%p-%r\" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o IdentityFile=\"/home/cgsmith/Sites/requirements/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key\" -o KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no -o PreferredAuthentications=gssapi-with-mic,gssapi-keyex,hostbased,publickey -o PasswordAuthentication=no -o User=vagrant -o ConnectTimeout=10 192.168.56.122 /bin/sh -c 'mkdir -p $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1430498290.35-217252812831737 && chmod a+rx $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1430498290.35-217252812831737 && echo $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1430498290.35-217252812831737'\n```\n\nI would _expect_ to see output in the ssh call to reference `-o ForwardAgent=yes`.
