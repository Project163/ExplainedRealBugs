I'm also unsure about try to add a \"smarter\" behaviour (automatically quote _only when necessary_, i.e. if this is an unquoted text that contains blank characters).\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons, I considered this issue as \"low priority\" and preferred to stick to this \"basic\" behaviour (KISS). But I'm open to accept the addition of the \"smarter\" behaviour described above, but not to always set the double quotes as proposed in #8158.\r\n\r\nI'm closing, but feedbacks (or pull request) are welcome.
