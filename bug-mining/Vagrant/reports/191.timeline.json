@secret104278 - Ideally the linux guest cap version would be a generic \"linux\" capability that would work in _most cases_. But in reality we will probably also have to add guest specific caps for distros that don't fit the generic \"mold\" and need more platform specific shutdown commands. Like for example your guest plugin assumes systemd, where as not all linux guests support that. I haven't looked into exactly how we'd probably implement this in Vagrant core, but I imagine it will look almost identical to the [windows reboot capability](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/guests/windows/cap/reboot.rb) but instead of executing powershell scripts, we would probably do something
