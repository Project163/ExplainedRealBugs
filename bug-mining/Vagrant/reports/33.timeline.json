we implement a naive solution to #5605 which catches the case that\na provided source contains an object which cannot be inspected, because\nan object contained within in has an #inspect string that returns a\nstring that is incompatible with the encoding in\n`Encoding.default_external` or a string which cannot be downcast to\n7-bit ascii.\n\nThe Ruby VM implementation of \"#inspect\" implements this checking on\nthese lines of code: http://git.io/vZYNS. A Ruby level override of\nthis method does not cause this problem. For example:\n\n``` ruby\nclass Foo\n  def inspect\n    \"😍\".encode(\"UTF-16LE\")\n  end\n```\n\nwill not cause the problem, because that's a Ruby implementation and the\nVM's checks don't occur.\n\nHowever, if we have an Object which **does** use the VM implementation\nof inspect, that contains an object that has an inspect string which\nreturns non-ascii, we encounter the bug. For example:\n\n``` ruby\nclass Bar\n  def inspect\n    \"😍\".encode(\"UTF-16LE\")\n  end\nend\n\nclass Foo\n  def initialize\n     @bar = Bar.new\n  end\nend\n\nFoo.new.inspect\n```\n\nWill cause the issue.\n\nThe solution this patch provides basically catches the encoding error\nand inserts a string which attempts to help the user work out which\nobject was provided without blowing up. Most likely, this was caused\nby a user having a weird encoding coming out of one of the sources\npassed in, but without a full repro case, it's not clear whether a patch\nshould be applied to a different object in the system.\n\nCloses #5605.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":404526922,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQwNDUyNjkyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/404526922","actor":{"login":"mitchellh","id":1299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh","html_url":"https://github.com/mitchellh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"790fa9f8e2ffe927820a3585095f4e9a47f57391","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/commits/790fa9f8e2ffe927820a3585095f4e9a47f57391","created_at":"2015-09-09T08:06:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3207889028,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MzIwNzg4OTAyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3207889028","actor":null,"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-07T02:04:12Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
