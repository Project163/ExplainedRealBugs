Same here.\n\nI started with the MSEdgeOnWin10 Vagrant Box availabe from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/windows/. This box comes with the OpenSSH server from http://www.mls-software.com/opensshd.html. So it's possible to start this box with the following settings:\n\n``` ruby\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\n  config.vm.box = \"Windows10\"\n  config.vm.guest = :windows\n  config.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"/vagrant\", disabled: true\n\n  config.ssh.username = \"IEUser\"\n  config.ssh.password = \"Passw0rd!\"\n  config.ssh.insert_key = false\n\n  config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |vb|\n    vb.cpus = 2\n    vb.memory = 1024\n  end\nend\n```\n\nHere the guest type \"windows\" is combined with communicator type \"ssh\". If the Vbox shared folder mounting is disabled then the box starts flawlessly and `vagrant ssh` can be used to access the OpenSSH server / Cygwin shell within Windows.\n\nEnabling Vagrants synced folder support brings up this SSH keep-alive issue. Here the culprit is in [`plugins/guests/windows/cap/mount_shared_folder.rb`](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/guests/windows/cap/mount_shared_folder.rb#L26) where a PowerShell script is executed despite of communicator \"ssh\".\n\nSo in `mount_shared_folder()` the winrm-related stuff could be embedded in an conditional block which checks the communicator first, e.g.\n\n``` ruby\ndef self.mount_shared_folder(machine, name, guestpath, vm_provider_unc_base)\n  if machine.config.vm.communicator == :winrm\n    name = name.gsub(/[\\/\\/]/,'_').sub(/^_/, '')\n    path = File.expand_path(\"../../scripts/mount_volume.ps1\", __FILE__)\n    script = Vagrant::Util::TemplateRenderer.render(path, options: {\n      mount_point: guestpath,\n      share_name: name,\n      vm_provider_unc_path: vm_provider_unc_base + name,\n    })\n\n    machine.communicate.execute(script, shell: :powershell)\n  else\n    if machine.communicate.test(\"uname -o | grep Cygwin\")\n      # Map the drive via \"NET USE \\* \\\\\\\\vboxsvr\\\\{#guestpath} {#ssh password} /USER:{# ssh user} /PERSISTENT:YES\"\n      # and create a symlink via \"cmd /c mklink /d {#guestpath} {# mapped drive}\"\n      # Same way as in \"plugins/synced_folders/smb/scripts/mount_share.ps1\"\n    end\n  end\n```\n\nIn the else block the ssh-related stuff (running in the Cygwin shell) could be implemented similar to the PowerShell script [`plugins/synced_folders/smb/scripts/mount_share.ps1`](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/1f88a9737369eda3dede0d3aeb30928adf82a9f7/plugins/synced_folders/smb/scripts/mount_share.ps1#L27):\n- Mapping the VBox synced folder to a new Windows drive via `NET USE \\* \\\\\\\\vboxsvr\\\\{#guestpath} {#ssh password} /USER:{#ssh user} /PERSISTENT:YES`\n- Extracting the letter of the mapped drive from the output\n- Creating a symlink via `cmd /c mklink /d {#guestpath} {# mapped drive}`\n\nDoing this manually after via `vagrant ssh`:\n\n```\n==> default: The machine you're attempting to SSH into is configured to use\n==> default: password-based authentication. Vagrant can't script entering the\n==> default: password for you. If you're prompted for a password, please enter\n==> default: the same password you have configured in the Vagrantfile.\nIEUser@127.0.0.1's password:\nLast login: Thu Jun  9 08:02:55 2016 from 10.0.2.2\n-sh-4.1$ net use \\* \\\\\\\\vboxsvr\\\\vagrant Passw0rd! /USER:IEUser /PERSISTENT:yes\nDrive Y: is now connected to \\\\vboxsvr\\vagrant.\n\nThe command completed successfully.\n\n-sh-4.1$ cmd /c mklink /d vagrant y:\nsymbolic link created for vagrant <<===>> y:\n-sh-4.1$ ls -l vagrant\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 IEUser None 11 Jun  9 12:11 vagrant -> /cygdrive/y\n-sh-4.1$\n```\n\nI'm not used to Ruby and Vagrant's code base. So I've no clue about executing these commands in the guest and extracting the drive letter from the
