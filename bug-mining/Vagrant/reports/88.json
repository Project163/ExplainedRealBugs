Expected behavior\n\nI would like to have possibility to use any symbol in extra_args.\n### Actual behavior\n\nMy password variable value has been cut from point where I used symbol '$' in extra_vars.\nWith extra_vars in raw_arguments all works fine.\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Use ansible_local\n2. Use extra_vars property with symbol $\n3.
