timeout. Please verify the machine properly booted and the network works. To do this, open the Hyper-V manager, find your virtual machine, and connect to it.\r\nThe most common cause for this error is that the running virtual machine doesn't have the latest Hyper-V integration drivers. Please research for your operating system how to install these in order for the VM to properly communicate its IP address to Hyper-V.`\r\nIncrease timeout didn't help, so I hoped it is the reason adding field `key_value_pair_exchange`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nStuck with error:\r\n`Failed to enable VM integration service Key-Value Pair Exchange: Es wurde keine Integrationskomponente mit dem angegebenen Namen gefunden.`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. added the values from integration services\r\n2. execute `vagrant up --provider=hyperv`\r\n3. found error\r\n\r\n### References\r\nAre there any other GitHub issues (open or closed) that should be linked here?\r\nsimilar issue:\r\n- GH-9679\r\n\r\n### fast Solution\r\nI digged a bit into this topic.\r\nAt first searching what I get back for integration services with this command:\r\n```\r\n> Get-VMIntegrationService -VMName generic-rhel7-hyperv\r\n             VMName               Name                               Enabled PrimaryStatusDescription SecondaryStatusDescription\r\n             ------               ----                               ------- ------------------------ --------------------------\r\n             generic-rhel7-hyperv Gastdienstschnittstelle            False\r\n             generic-rhel7-hyperv Takt                               True\r\n             generic-rhel7-hyperv Austausch von Schlüsselwertepaaren True\r\n             generic-rhel7-hyperv Herunterfahren                     True\r\n             generic-rhel7-hyperv Zeitsynchronisierung               True\r\n             generic-rhel7-hyperv VSS                                True\r\n```\r\nLike you see especially `Name` column is in national language.\r\nAnd here:\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/providers/hyperv/driver.rb#L13\r\nI've seen that there is a hard coded mapping to the configuration values.\r\n\r\nSo I found out that it is enough to replace the values from Englisch with the German ones like that:\r\n\r\n| ConfigValue                  | English Name                    | German Name                        |\r\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\r\n| guest_service_interface      | Guest Service Interface         | Gastdienstschnittstelle            |\r\n| heartbeat                    | Heartbeat                       | Takt                               |\r\n| key_value_pair_exchange      | Key-Value Pair Exchange         | Austausch von Schlüsselwertepaaren |\r\n| shutdown                     | Shutdown                        | Herunterfahren                     |\r\n| time_synchronization         | Time Synchronization            | Zeitsynchronisierung               |\r\n| vss                          | VSS                             | VSS                                |\r\n\r\nI corrected all these values in `drivers.rb` and everything was fine apart from 3 issues:\r\n1. For config value `vss` is it's Name both in German and English the same, so no correction needed.\r\n2. For config value `shutdown` was German `Herunterfahren` but that didn't work, I had to change it back to `Shutdown`, but didn't find the source for that.\r\nMaybe the issue is here, but maybe I am wrong...\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/guests/windows/scripts/reboot_detect.ps1#L21\r\nSo I don't know where this is used:\r\nhttps://www.vagrantup.com/docs/hyperv/configuration.html#shutdown\r\nPossibly it is for using Windows hosts because there is an open issue, that documentation is not good documented:\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8449\r\n3. The most hard issue to resolve for me as a starting point was the `key_value_pair_exchange` with it's German name containing an \"Umlaut\" called `ü`.\r\nThe solution was then after reading lots of how encoding works under JRuby for me here:\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/providers/hyperv/driver.rb#L206\r\nI added following line between line 206 and 207, which resolved my issue:\r\n```\r\n          args[:Name] = args[:Name].encode!( 'ISO-8859-1', 'UTF-8', invalid: :replace, undef: :replace, replace: '?' )\r\n```\r\nThe exact issue was here, that Ruby got the `ü` correctly, but it wasn't transported correctly to the Powershell script.\r\n\r\n\r\n### long term Solution\r\n\r\nNow, this is no good long term solution, because of that I didn't do a pull request and maybe others have better ideas.\r\nMy assumption is, there in other language versions of Windows can potentially happen similar issues.\r\nSo how to get that solved, because Windows delivers these language specific values through HyperV.\r\nBut here for instance is a workaround established to handout a default network device to vagrant:\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/providers/hyperv/action/configure.rb#L24\r\nwith something like that in `Vagrantfile`:\r\n```  config.vm.network \"public_network\", bridge: \"Default Switch\"```\r\n\r\nSo I could imagine the similar solution can be like that in Vagrantfile\r\n```\r\n        guest_service_interface: true, lang_guest: \"Gastdienstschnittstelle\"\r\n        key_value_pair_exchange: true, lang_key_value_pair: \"Austausch von Schlüsselwertepaaren\"\r\n        time_synchronization: true, lang_time_sync: \"Zeitsynchronisation\"\r\n        heartbeat: true, lang_heartbeat: \"Takt\",\r\n        shutdown: true, lang_shutdown: \"Herunterfahren\"\r\n        vss: true, lang_vss: \"VSS\"\r\n```\r\nAnd if the values for `lang_*` don't exist, fall back to the English mapping values as default.\r\n\r\nIdentify VM Name:\r\n```\r\nGet-VM\r\n```\r\nAnd for exact identification having on the documentation page the command:\r\n```\r\n Get-VMIntegrationService -VMName <VMName>\r\n```\r\nIdeally last command can even be executed inside vagrant, with will document the values in the case vagrant is in debug mode.\r\n\r\nAny propositions or opinions to that? Because I am not able to correct that with my Ruby knowledge, possibly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/605744095","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9679#issuecomment-605744095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9679","id":605744095,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNTc0NDA5NQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-30T02:06:11Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T02:06:11Z","body":"I'm going to lock this issue because it has been closed for _30 days_ ⏳.
