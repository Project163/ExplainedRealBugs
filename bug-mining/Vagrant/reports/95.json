Since the password is optional, it might be empty. I use the `config.vagrant.sensitive` option to prevent any output of the password.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to check if the password is not empty before setting the config option, but I think that it is to vagrant to check for empty strings when evaluating this option.\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\n2.0.2\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nUbuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile (relevant part)\r\n```ruby\r\n  if [\"up\",\"provision\"].include? ARGV[0] or ARGV.include? \"--provision\"\r\n    # Prompt for some information that we pass to Ansible later.\r\n    print \"Enter password (Leave it empty to skip tasks that need the password): \"\r\n    password = STDIN.noecho(&:gets).chomp\r\n    print \"\\n\"\r\n    # Hide password from output\r\n    config.vagrant.sensitive = [password]\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\nI think you can imagine the output.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nNormal, readable output\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nUnreadable output due to massve star print. Vagrant tries to hide any occurance of a string, which is empty.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Paste above snippet into Vagrantfile\r\n2. Enter empty password\r\n3. Launch vagrant\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
