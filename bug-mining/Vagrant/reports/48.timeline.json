Vagrant version\r\n1.9.5\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nFedora 25\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nFedora 25\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\r\n    config.vm.box = \"freeipa/ci-master-f25\"\r\n    config.vm.box_version = \"0.2.5\"\r\n\r\n    config.vm.network \"private_network\",\r\n        ip: \"192.168.101.100\"\r\n\r\n    config.vm.hostname = \"controller.ipa.test\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\n- `vagrant up`: https://gist.github.com/tomaskrizek/30085a696a9e5807a9711e47ca900f4e\r\n- `journalctl -u network` on VM: https://gist.github.com/tomaskrizek/28ee03e81c306df4ad50a0644226654d\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nVM successfully starts with the specified IP and hostname.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nVM starts, but setting the hostname fails.\r\nWhen vagrant attempts to restart network after it sets the hostname, this probably races with some other restart of the network service and it fails with `dhclient(651) is already running - exiting`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. use Vagrantfile above\r\n2. `vagrant up`\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- At first I though this may be an issue with `vagrant-libvirt`: https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt/issues/785 \r\n- Similar issue in `vagrant-parallels`:  https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels/issues/83\r\n- Simillar issue in vagrant with different box: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5852\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n- I'm not able to reproduce this with `fedora/25-cloud-base`, so it may be a box issue, but I have no idea what could possibly be causing it. \r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nDo not use vagrant to set the hostname.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3203353561,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MzIwMzM1MzU2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3203353561","actor":null,"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-06T01:58:17Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
