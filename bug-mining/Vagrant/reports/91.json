This can happen due to networking issues, but can also just due to slowness from the DHCP server. \r\n\r\nWhen it's a networking issue like Windows can't get a good IP then vagrant will grab the APIPA from Hyper-V (I've only tested this on Hyper-V) and try to WinRM using an IP that will never work. It eventually fails which would be expected behavior, but it's a little awkward to vagrant spins for a while trying to WinRM with an IP that is clearly bad.\r\n\r\nSometimes it just so happens that vagrant asks for the IP address before Windows has a good one, and it'll get the APIPA from Hyper-V even though moments later a good IP is assigned to Windows. This is a more concerning edge case because technically there was nothing wrong with the server. Vagrant just happened to ask for the IP before Windows was ready.\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\n2.0.0\r\n\r\nPretty sure this issue is in every version of vagrant, but I've seen it as early as 1.9.2 for sure.\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nWindows Server 2012 R2\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n\r\nDefault vagrantfile\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# -*- mode: ruby -*-\r\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\r\n\r\n# All Vagrant configuration is done below.

Vagrant tries to WinRM using the APIPA until it times out. I unfortunately don't have a gist of when there's networking slowness since it's sporadic, but the behavior is the same on the vagrant side.\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/bshurts/634e3ae5d8fe24f209bb3e64206d2d16\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nVagrant throws out the APIPA (`169.254.*.*`) and tries again for a valid IP\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nVagrant accepts the APIPA and proceeds to attempt to WinRM with an unusable IP address\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a vanilla internal network switch in Hyper-V\r\n2. Vagrant up a Windows box in Hyper-V using the switch","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
