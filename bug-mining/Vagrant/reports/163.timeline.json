all - It looks like there's a way to install a specific version, but it looks like it was never actually hooked up with the chef-solo provisioner. I also noticed that apparently this very important page on how to use the provisioners is buried in the docs instead of a link on the nav bar: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/chef_common.html\r\n\r\nI just tried to use the version option and it looks like Vagrant ignored it. If I manually go in and change the version myself it seems to install the right version...so the fix shouldn't be too bad :crossed_fingers: \r\n\r\nI'll mark this as an enhancement to get this all cleaned up.
