The [docs for smb_username](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/smb.html#smb_username) mention:\r\n\r\n> If this option is not specified, Vagrant will prompt you for it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the truth is that [both Username *and* Password need to be specified](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/v2.0.3/plugins/synced_folders/smb/synced_folder.rb#L54) in order to not be prompted for the Username. Given that the Vagrant docs also suggest that youdon't specify the Password, it seems like a good idea to make the username prompt conditional on only the username being specified.","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9591/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9591/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
