the maximum amount of time Vagrant would poll for whether a VM has successfully reboot was hard coded to 120 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the `VAGRANT_MAX_REBOOT_RETRY_TIMEOUT` environment variable to allow users to configure the maximum time to support OS configurations that happen to take longer than 120 seconds to reboot.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds RSpec tests for the maximum retry logic. I wanted to add some tests around the actual environment variable, but since it's set to a constant on the class it'll require unloading and loading the class back up which was fairly ugly to do in the test. You can see below the environment variable in action (and failing the test because the number of retries don't match).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1368\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-31 at 6 18 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167443/97791149-8cc1d880-1ba5-11eb-911e-916ccc3a9ca5.png\">\r\n\r\nHopefully this is useful, thank you!\r\n\r\nFixes #11695\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/12011/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3955234583,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk1NTIzNDU4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3955234583","actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-03T23:47:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/738501853","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11695#issuecomment-738501853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11695","id":738501853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODUwMTg1Mw==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-04T01:50:13Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T01:50:13Z","body":"I'm going to lock this issue because it has been closed for _30 days_ ⏳.
