provisioner](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/ansible_local.html)\n- Creates an inventory for Ansible entirely within Vagrant, without external tools\n- Thoroughly documents our Vagrant

#929 and focus on this one. Its work is entirely reproduced or enhanced here. \n\nI have tested it with varying numbers of workers, but don't have the RAM to test 3 control nodes. It'd be great if anybody could test that.\n\nNext steps:\n1. GlusterFS support\n2. LVM support\n3. Add edge nodes\n4. Update packer scripts/mi box (@ChrisAubuchon)\n5. Fix this very rare error if it still happens (unclear): http://pastebin.com/csrNsK07\n6. Multi-datacenter simulation\n7. Instead of `addons`, just have a list of playbooks to run with the default being `[terraform.sample.yml]`, so you can use `vagrant provision` to run other playbooks.  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mantl/mantl/issues/942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mantl/mantl/issues/942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":502348541,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwMjM0ODU0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/502348541","actor":{"login":"gildegoma","id":434654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDY1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma","html_url":"https://github.com/gildegoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-29T19:41:23Z","label":{"name":"provisioner/ansible","color":"bfdadc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":502349573,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUwMjM0OTU3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/502349573","actor":{"login":"gildegoma","id":434654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDY1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma","html_url":"https://github.com/gildegoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-29T19:43:17Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/167862574","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6763#issuecomment-167862574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6763","id":167862574,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Nzg2MjU3NA==","user":{"login":"gildegoma","id":434654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDY1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma","html_url":"https://github.com/gildegoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-29T19:44:35Z","updated_at":"2015-12-29T19:45:01Z","body":"@siddharthist Thanks for reporting this.
