thank you very much for providing this image. First one I tried that has \"Install-WindowsFeature\" working!\r\nNow the question: Should the vagrant provisioning step map a network drive and return some OK status?\r\nI am getting a timeout instead.\r\nUsing vagrant  2.2.1 + Windows 10 [Version 10.0.15063] \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vagrant init cdaf/WindowsServerStandard\r\nA `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now\r\nready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read\r\nthe comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on\r\n`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.\r\n\r\n$ vagrant up\r\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'hyperv' provider...\r\n==> default: Verifying Hyper-V is enabled...\r\n==> default: Verifying Hyper-V is accessible...\r\n==> default: Importing a Hyper-V instance\r\n    default: Creating and registering the VM...\r\n    default: Successfully imported VM\r\n    default: Please choose a switch to attach to your Hyper-V instance.\r\n    default: If none of these are appropriate, please open the Hyper-V manager\r\n    default: to create a new virtual switch.\r\n    default:\r\n    default: 1) Internal\r\n    default:\r\n    default: What switch would you like to use? 1\r\n    default: Configuring the VM...\r\n==> default: Starting the machine...\r\n==> default: Waiting for the machine to report its IP address...\r\n    default: Timeout: 120 seconds\r\n    default: IP: 192.168.137.118\r\n==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...\r\n    default: SSH address: 192.168.137.118:22\r\n    default: SSH username: vagrant\r\n    default: SSH auth method: private key\r\nTimed out while waiting for the machine to boot. This means that\r\nVagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within\r\nthe configured (\"config.vm.boot_timeout\" value) time period.\r\n\r\nIf you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that\r\nVagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors\r\nare usually good hints as to what may be wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly\r\nworking and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common\r\nproblem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.\r\nVerify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nIf the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase\r\nthe timeout (\"config.vm.boot_timeout\") value.\r\n\r\n$ vagrant rdp\r\nVM must be created before running this command. Run `vagrant up` first.\r\n\r\n$ vagrant ssh\r\n\r\n$ (no response whatsoever)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was able to connect using Hyper-v console. Was forced to use administrator user and guessed that the password was 'vagrant'. Installing windows features worked. To connect remotely I had to disable the Windows Firewall using:\r\n\r\nSet-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled False\r\n\r\nAfter turning off the firewall, I tried 'vagrant halt' and 'vagrant up' but I got the same error.\r\nWhat is the expected result?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cdaf/windows/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cdaf/windows/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/442197986","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10438#issuecomment-442197986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10438","id":442197986,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MjE5Nzk4Ng==","user":{"login":"gerardog","id":3901474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDE0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3901474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog","html_url":"https://github.com/gerardog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerardog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T20:04:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T20:04:56Z","body":"I

I've found that both `path` and `args` can affect it.\r\n\r\nThere are four test cases here:\r\n\r\n- for the temp dir, I used the same value: `C:/Users/ADMINI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/vagrant20181122-10048-pj7qli`\r\n- for `path` argument (to a Powershell script), I tried a really short path, `C:/Vagrant/unset_share.ps1` and one that might resemble a real installation: `C:/Vagrant/embedded/gems/2.2.1/gems/vagrant-2.2.1/plugins/hosts/windows/scripts/unset_share.ps1`\r\n- for `opts` argument (representing SMB share names), I also used two values, one array of two short elements, `[\"vgt-folder-1\", \"vgt-folder-2\"]` and one array of a single long string that I've actually copied from above, `[\"vgt-f9ab1c45e62eedaafd49b9fd1b2f440c-543004a29e9b0c07d8d4666f0654faa0\"]`\r\n\r\nFrom that I've produced four combinations which the test runs on:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  describe \".powerup_command\" do\r\n    let(:result) do\r\n      Vagrant::Util::Subprocess::Result.new(exit_code, stdout, stderr)\r\n    end\r\n    let(:exit_code){ 0 }\r\n    let(:stdout){ \"\" }\r\n    let(:stderr){ \"\" }\r\n\r\n    test_cases = [\r\n      [\r\n        \"short path and arguments\",\r\n        \"C:/Users/ADMINI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/vagrant20181122-10048-pj7qli\",\r\n        \"C:/Vagrant/unset_share.ps1\",\r\n        [\r\n          \"vgt-folder-1\",\r\n          \"vgt-folder-2\",\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n      [\r\n        \"short path and long arguments\",\r\n        \"C:/Users/ADMINI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/vagrant20181122-10048-pj7qli\",\r\n        \"C:/Vagrant/unset_share.ps1\",\r\n        [\r\n          \"vgt-f9ab1c45e62eedaafd49b9fd1b2f440c-543004a29e9b0c07d8d4666f0654faa0\",\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n      [\r\n        \"long path and short arguments\",\r\n        \"C:/Users/ADMINI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/vagrant20181122-10048-pj7qli\",\r\n        \"C:/Vagrant/embedded/gems/2.2.1/gems/vagrant-2.2.1/plugins/hosts/windows/scripts/unset_share.ps1\",\r\n        [\r\n          \"vgt-folder-1\",\r\n          \"vgt-folder-2\",\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n      [\r\n        \"long path and arguments\",\r\n        \"C:/Users/ADMINI~1/AppData/Local/Temp/vagrant20181122-10048-pj7qli\",\r\n        \"C:/Vagrant/embedded/gems/2.2.1/gems/vagrant-2.2.1/plugins/hosts/windows/scripts/unset_share.ps1\",\r\n        [\r\n          \"vgt-f9ab1c45e62eedaafd49b9fd1b2f440c-543004a29e9b0c07d8d4666f0654faa0\",\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    test_cases.each do |description, tmpdir, path, args|\r\n\r\n      it \"should work with \" + description do\r\n        # Mock Subprocess.execute call\r\n        allow(Vagrant::Util::Subprocess).to receive(:execute).and_return(result)\r\n        # Mock Dir.mktmpdir call\r\n        allow(Dir).to receive(:mktmpdir).and_yield(tmpdir)\r\n        # Capture Base64.urlsafe_encode64 calls and do experiments on its arguments and return values\r\n        expect(Base64).to receive(:urlsafe_encode64).twice.and_wrap_original do |m, *args|\r\n          # Call original method\r\n          encoded = m.call(*args)\r\n          # Try decoding it back and compare to input argument, it always passes\r\n          expect(args[0].b).to eq(Base64.urlsafe_decode64(encoded).b)\r\n          # Try decoding it using strict_decode64 method, the result varies\r\n          expect(args[0].b).to eq(Base64.strict_decode64(encoded).b)\r\n          encoded\r\n        end\r\n\r\n        described_class.powerup_command(path, args, {})\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n .powerup_command\r\n    should work with short path and arguments\r\n    should work with short path and long arguments\r\n    should work with long path and short arguments\r\n    should work with long path and arguments (FAILED - 1)\r\n\r\nFailures:\r\n\r\n  1) Vagrant::Util::PowerShell.powerup_command should work with long path and arguments\r\n     Failure/Error: expect(args[0].b).to eq(Base64.strict_decode64(encoded).b)\r\n\r\n     ArgumentError:\r\n       invalid base64\r\n     # ./test/unit/vagrant/util/powershell_test.rb:377:in `block (5 levels) in <top (required)>'\r\n     # ./lib/vagrant/util/powershell.rb:227:in `block in powerup_command'\r\n     # ./lib/vagrant/util/powershell.rb:211:in `powerup_command'\r\n     # ./test/unit/vagrant/util/powershell_test.rb:381:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes, I discovered there is more than one method to encode with Base64 in Ruby :)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm trying to do a legal thing here, by attempting a different Base64 decode method, but it passes 3 out of 4 times. The only docs I've been able to find for Powershell command line (linked below) does not seem to distinguish any special way to encode the command. I guess the question is which of those methods is the correct one to use, `urlsafe_encode64` over `strict_encode64`.\r\n\r\nI tried to edit the file in my Vagrant installation and replace `urlsafe_encode64` with `strict_encode64`, and it worked, then revert my changes and the issue came back again, so it might seem as a solution, but I wasn't able to tell what exactly is messing up the encoded string when using `urlsafe_encode64`.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/console/powershell.exe-command-line-help\r\nhttps://apidock.com/ruby/Base64/strict_encode64\r\nhttps://apidock.com/ruby/Base64/urlsafe_encode64","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/444942498/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"czukowski","id":186792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski","html_url":"https://github.com/czukowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/czukowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2011303339,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMTEzMDMzMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/2011303339","actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8d36ba8864f62157019fff8238f50ec2d380ff8a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisroberts/vagrant/commits/8d36ba8864f62157019fff8238f50ec2d380ff8a","created_at":"2018-12-07T00:28:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-07T00:28:44Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T00:28:44Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10487","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10487/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10487/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10487/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/pull/10487","id":388455677,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjM2NzE3OTk0","number":10487,"title":"Use
