the `config.vm.synced_folder` `type` explicitly specified in Vagrantfile as \"**vboxvfs**\", there is 'Internal error' (see below) finishes `vagrant up` command.\r\n### Vagrant\r\nVagrant 2.0.1\r\n### Host OS\r\nUbuntu 16.04.3 LTS x96_64\r\n### Host hypervisor\r\nVirtualBox 5.2.4r119785\r\n### Guest OS\r\nFreeBSD-11.1-RELEASE-p6 amd64\r\n### Guest addons\r\nvirtualbox-ose-additions-nox11-5.2.4 (via `pkg`)\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n```\r\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\r\n  config.vm.define \"www4\" do |host|\r\n    host.vm.box      = \"vg-freebsd\"\r\n    host.vm.hostname = \"www4\"\r\n

error:\r\n```\r\n/opt/vagrant/embedded/gems/gems/vagrant-2.0.1/lib/vagrant/action/builtin/mixin_synced_folders.rb:137:in `block in synced_folders': Internal error. Report this as a bug. Invalid: vboxvfs (RuntimeError)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nSee [vagrant_up_error.log](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/files/1628021/vagrant_up_error.log) attached.\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nThe similar to @RainbowHackerHorse mentioned above already, excepting the FreeBSD box was built from the 'official'  FreeBSD VM [image](https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/VM-IMAGES/11.1-RELEASE/amd64/Latest/FreeBSD-11.1-RELEASE-amd64.vhd.xz) and the guest additions were installed via `pkg` command.\r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting\r\nOnce manually created for the guest, `vagrant` share folder has been mounted OK:\r\n```\r\nmount -t vboxvfs vagrant /vagrant/\r\n```\r\nIf the synced folder disabled in the Vagrantfile:\r\n```\r\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"/vagrant\", disabled: true\r\n```\r\nthe `vagrant up www4` completes successfully.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nAll the steps are `Vagrantfile` code between `Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|` and `end`.\r\n1. Disable default Vagrant synced folder:\r\n```\r\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"/vagrant\", disabled: true\r\n```\r\n2. Make the synced folder 'manually':\r\n```\r\nhost.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|\r\n  vb.customize [ \"sharedfolder\", \"add\", :id, \"--name\", \"vagrant\", \"--hostpath\", \"/home/user/tmp/share\", \"--automount\" ]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n3. Mount the folder on provisioning and make it persistent:\r\n```\r\nhost.vm.provision \"shell\", inline: <<-EOD\r\n  mkdir -p -m 700 /vagrant\r\n  egrep '^\\s*vagrant' /etc/fstab ||\\\r\n    echo \"vagrant /vagrant vboxvfs rw 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\r\n  mount | egrep '^vagrant.+/vagrant.+' ||\\\r\n    mount

If I dump it into a mounted vboxvfs folder while the machine is off, then restart, it only transfers part of the codebase. There doesn't seem to be anything special about the folders it doesn't transfer (e.g there are no symlinks in them, and even then I've added that `VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate` 'hack' to be sure)\r\n\r\nSecondly, scripts that run to bootstrap my dependencies kill the vboxvfs mount. I've got both NPM and Cpan deps to install. Even if I symlink both affected folders outside the mount, as suggested by so many online, if I perform any task on the guest that attempts to enter either folder it kills the ssh session, sometimes kills the box, and usually the mount stops responding properly until I reboot the guest.\r\n\r\nBoth these issues are well documented online, I'm not seeking a solution. Just a bit bummed that vboxvfs support isn't quite the silver bullet I had hoped after waiting so long for support for it in freebsd!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/395001233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davecranwell-adestra","id":33837371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODM3Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33837371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra","html_url":"https://github.com/davecranwell-adestra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davecranwell-adestra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/439907954","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8884#issuecomment-439907954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8884","id":439907954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzOTkwNzk1NA==","user":{"login":"rick-pri","id":1507583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDc1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1507583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri","html_url":"https://github.com/rick-pri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rick-pri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-19T14:19:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T14:05:57Z","body":"It
