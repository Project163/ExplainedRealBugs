This is similar to #936 and #2701. In those issues, some workarounds were mentioned, but I haven't managed to get them to work for myself.\n\nI need to have some setup run before the folder is mounted because I need the synced folder to be inside another folder that doesn't exist in the Virtual Machine until after my provisioning. I either need the option for synced folders to be done after provisioning or I could also use preparing the synced folder and disable the auto mount so I can use my provisioner to call `mount` manually.\n\nI tried to use `disabled: true` but this seems to cause the folder to never be prepared. I tried some of the advice mentioned [here](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/936#issuecomment-23467018), but the following don't work:\n\n```\n# requires at least two arguments\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \".\"\n# the guestpath is used as the name and the guestpath, causes an error when booting\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \".\", nil\n# sets the name correctly, but errors out because the guestpath gets used at some point\noptions = config.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"name\"\noptions[:guestpath] = nil\n```\n\nIs there anyway to do what I want?\n\nI am using Vagrant 1.8.1.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6835/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
