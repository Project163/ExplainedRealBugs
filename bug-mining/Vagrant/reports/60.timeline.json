thanks! That Vagrantfile was stripped down to submit this issue. I more complete one is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/antoncohen/grocery_delivery-cookbook/blob/master/Vagrantfile\n\nRegarding this being a duplicate, it does appear to be a duplicate of #4654. But #4654 has gone a bit off topic into discussing things like changing the .box format so providers can be detected before downloading the box.\n\nI think I've shown this is actually a much simpler bug. The [documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/basic_usage.html) states:\n\n> Vagrant will go through all of the config.vm.provider calls in the Vagrantfile and try each in order. It will choose the first provider that is usable. For example, if you configure Hyper-V, it will never be chosen on Mac this way. It must be both configured and usable.\n\nLooking at the code it appears that that list of providers is stored in the `__providers` variable, and is supposed to be used to pick a provider. As the output above shows, `__providers` is being set correctly. I think the bug might actually be in the vagrant-vmware-fusion plugin, which is overriding the intended behavior of Vagrant core.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/214032142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"antoncohen","id":784476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NDQ3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/784476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen","html_url":"https://github.com/antoncohen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoncohen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":639183326,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjM5MTgzMzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/639183326","actor":{"login":"darkn3rd","id":7537882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Mzc4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7537882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd","html_url":"https://github.com/darkn3rd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-24T20:41:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":639183327,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDYzOTE4MzMyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/639183327","actor":{"login":"darkn3rd","id":7537882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Mzc4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7537882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd","html_url":"https://github.com/darkn3rd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkn3rd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-24T20:41:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/241870553","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7135#issuecomment-241870553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7135","id":241870553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTg3MDU1Mw==","user":{"login":"alexoj","id":9037535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMzc1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9037535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj","html_url":"https://github.com/alexoj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexoj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-23T20:37:55Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T20:41:13Z","body":"@antoncohen \nI was having the same issue and tracked the bug to these lines in lib/vagrant/environment.rb:\n\n```\n      root_config.vm.__providers.reverse.each_with_index do |key, idx|\n        config[key] = idx\n      end\n```\n\nLater in the same function it increases the provider's priority if the provider was mentioned in the config:\n\n```\n        priority = config[key] + max_priority if config.key?(key)\n```\n\nHowever, if the index of the provider in the `__providers` list is 0, as it would be if it's the only one, priority ends up being set to the max priority instead of to the max priority + 1. That means there are 2 providers with the same priority, the one you specified and the one which originally had the max priority, which means that there's no reason to prefer the provider you specified over the original default.\n\nChanging the previous snippet to this solved the issue for me:\n\n```\n      root_config.vm.__providers.reverse.each_with_index do |key, idx|\n

#7135: config.vm.provider not setting provider in multi-machine Vagrantfile\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Make `Vagrantfile`\n2. Configure only one provider using `config.vm.provider`.\n3. `vagrant up`\n4. Default provider may get used instead of configured one.\n\nI tracked the bug to these lines in lib/vagrant/environment.rb:\n\n```\n      root_config.vm.__providers.reverse.each_with_index do |key, idx|\n        config[key] = idx\n      end\n```\n\nLater in the same function it increases the provider's priority if the provider was mentioned in the config:\n\n```\n        priority = config[key] + max_priority if config.key?(key)\n```\n\nHowever, if the index of the provider in the `__providers` list is 0, as it would be if it's the only one, priority ends up being set to the max priority instead of to the max priority + 1. That means there are 2 providers with the same priority, the one you specified and the one which originally had the max priority, which means that there's no reason to prefer the provider you specified over the original default.\n\nThis patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the `config[]` dict gets set with values greater than 0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/608196689","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7135#issuecomment-608196689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7135","id":608196689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODE5NjY4OQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-03T02:35:14Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T02:35:14Z","body":"I'm going to lock this issue because it has been closed for _30 days_ ⏳.
