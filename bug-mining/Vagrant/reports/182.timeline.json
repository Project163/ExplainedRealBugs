That bug manifests itself as the `Installing Ansible...` step failing (rather than hanging), but once resolved I get the hang described here.\r\n\r\nFor people with my problem, you'll instead see:\r\n```\r\nThe following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.\r\nVagrant assumes that this means the command failed!\r\n\r\napt-get install -y -qq build-essential curl git libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev\r\n\r\nStdout from the command:\r\n\r\n<...snip...>\r\n\r\nChecking init scripts...\r\ndpkg: error processing package libssl1.1:amd64 (--configure):\r\n installed libssl1.1:amd64 package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 10\r\n```\r\nThe workaround suggested on Launchpad for the post-installation script failure is to run `dpkg-reconfigure libc6`. After doing that in a shell provisioning step I get a hang as described here.\r\n\r\nMy full workaround (which means Vagrant can still pull latest Ansible from pip):\r\n```ruby\r\n# Install libssl for Ansible (to work around https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/+bug/1832919)\r\nconfig.vm.provision \"shell\",\r\n  inline: \"sudo apt-get update -y -qq && \"\\\r\n    \"sudo
