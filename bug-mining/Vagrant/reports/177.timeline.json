Description\r\n\r\nOn macOS 10.15 (Catalina), `/` is read-only and paths inside of `/Users` (and elsewhere) are mounted via a \"firmlink\" (which is a new invention in APFS). These must be resolved to their full path to be shareable via NFS.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/johnsmith/mycode  =>  /System/Volumes/Data/Users/johnsmith/mycode\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code tests each shared folder on the host, to see if it's 1) inside of an APFS filesystem, and 2) in this firmlink situation. Firmlinks are only createable by the OS, so this hardcoded path to check should be fine — at least until Apple adds more.\r\n\r\nAnd this all was supposed to be visible to applications anyway. There's a useful intro to APFS changes in 10.15 here (linked to the right time)\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/710/?time=481\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\nThis fixes #10961 — and there were some helpful commenters in there who helped me track down where to begin.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThere weren't tests for the BSD NFS class, so I added one, but it's pretty isolated. This should also be testable by trying to share any folder below your home directory via NFS on 10.15. You'll see the side effects in `/etc/exports` on the host, which will have a `/System/Volumes/Data` prefix.\r\n\r\n[Our team at Nutshell](https://github.com/nutshellcrm/) has been using vagrant for 6 years — thanks for making our lives easier, Mitchell & co!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11105/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/538906659","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10961#issuecomment-538906659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10961","id":538906659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzODkwNjY1OQ==","user":{"login":"musikov","id":4687396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4687396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov","html_url":"https://github.com/musikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/musikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-07T09:03:33Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T09:03:33Z","body":"> Where exactly would I add this to Vagrantfile?

it for users who have upgraded to Catalina and are unable to launch Homestead.\r\n\r\n[Workaround](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10961#issuecomment-526132132) is to prefix each folder in `Homestead.yaml` with `/System/Volumes/Data/Users`, removing `~` and make the same change in `/etc/exports`.\r\n\r\ne.g. `~/taylor/Laravel` would become `/System/Volumes/Data/Users/taylor/Laravel`.\r\n\r\nSecond potential issue with upgrading to Catalina is bash is being phased out for zsh, and users may have replaced their shell with zsh (or have it as default if it's a new install).\r\n\r\nIf so, the `homestead` function added to `~/.bash_profile` would need to be added to `~/.zshrc` instead.

the bug**\r\n\r\nPeople who use nfsd and upgrade to Catalina are getting no shares; `showmount -e` shows nothing, and `nfsd checkexports` shows errors like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nfsd checkexports\r\n---> Got line: #/Users/rfay -alldirs -mapall=501:20\r\n---> Got line: /Users/rfay -alldirs -mapall=501:20 localhost\r\n/System/Volumes/Data using UUID CBD1C659-0D22-4494-BEA6-43958CDA4391\r\nexports:2: exported dir/fs mismatch: /Users/rfay /System/Volumes/Data\r\n---> Got line: /Users/rfay/workspace -alldirs -mapall=501:20 localhost\r\n/System/Volumes/Data using UUID CBD1C659-0D22-4494-BEA6-43958CDA4391\r\nexports:3: exported dir/fs mismatch: /Users/rfay/workspace /System/Volumes/Data\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that in macOS Catalina the /etc/exports file requires /System/Volumes/Data in front of the shared path.\r\n\r\nPartial workaround (does not solve the problem completely for ddev) is to \r\n1. Edit /etc/exports to change each shared path to prepend /System/Volumes/Data, so `/Users/rfay/workspace -alldirs -mapall=501:20 localhost` becomes `/System/Volumes/Data/Users/rfay/workspace -alldirs -mapall=501:20 localhost`\r\n2. Run `nfsd checkexports` is the next step; make sure it has no complaints.\r\n3. `sudo nfsd restart`\r\n4. `showmount -e` should now show exported shares. \r\n\r\nRequired items in the PR:\r\n* ddev has to mount /System/Volumes/Data/... instead of just /Users/...\r\n* Update the scripts/macos_ddev_nfs_setup.sh to be aware of this problem and work on all supported macOS versions.\r\n* Update the docs to mention `nfsd checkexports`, it's mighty nice. \r\n* Update the docs to mention macOS debugging techniques: Run console, search for nfsd, restart\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\nThanks to

I was able to fix `vagrant_synced_folders` by changing `local_path` from `/Users/karl/Sites` to `/System/Volumes/Data/Users/karl/Sites/`, but the NFS synced vagrant directory is set in the Vagrantfile using `File.dirname(File.expand_path(__FILE__))` which when NFS-mounted is no longer the correct path. On Catalina `/System/Volumes/Data` should be prepended to `host_project_dir`.\r\n\r\nIf I run `DRUPALVM_PROJECT_ROOT=/System/Volumes/Data/Users/karl/Vagrant/php72 vagrant up` it all works, but it would be nice to not have to set that var each time.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to have `vagrant_synced_folders` corrected automatically, but I don't have to \"hack core\" to fix that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/issues/1978/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/issues/1978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/539702222","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10961#issuecomment-539702222","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10961","id":539702222,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzOTcwMjIyMg==","user":{"login":"bobbytables","id":521627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTYyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/521627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables","html_url":"https://github.com/bobbytables","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobbytables/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-08T21:00:23Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T21:00:23Z","body":"If
