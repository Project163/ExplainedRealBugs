#7629.\nnfs-server.service seems to load kernel modules it needs itself, while nfsd appears in `/proc/filesystems` only after the kernel module has been loaded, so vagrant fails to detect NFS server until it's started first time after the system has booted. The updated command checks if the NFS service actually exists and hopes that it'll figure the stuff out itself.\n\n`list-unit-files` is utilized rather than `list-units` because systemd seems to not list units that are disabled: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2011-November/159117.html\n\nThe issue appeared at d29acc8982323b6f9e98b08d60ff4b8b5f0b9938. The fix wasn't wrong as checking nfs doesn't really make sense because it's client-side capability but insufficiend because it fails until the kernel module is loaded which doesn't happen on boot on a default setup.\n\n@Barthalion I'd appreciate you taking a look at it as I've changed your line.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7630/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":732623222,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzMyNjIzMjIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/732623222","actor":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-07-23T19:15:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":733412342,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDczMzQxMjM0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/733412342","actor":{"login":"carlosefr","id":937276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNzI3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/937276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosefr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosefr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"400a01850de6c48f85986a2973d0dfc091743130","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carlosefr/vagrant/commits/400a01850de6c48f85986a2973d0dfc091743130","created_at":"2016-07-25T11:45:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"cognifloyd","id":1558590,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTg1OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1558590?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd","html_url":"https://github.com/cognifloyd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cognifloyd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-08T17:33:37Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T17:33:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8658","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8658/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8658/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8658/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8658","id":234601943,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzQ2MDE5NDM=","number":8658,"title":"NFS

is the same issue as #7629 (fixed by #7630), but for a gentoo host instead of arch.\r\nI have NFS server capabilities compiled as kernel modules instead of compiled into the kernel.\r\nTherefore, they are not loaded (and can't be detected in /proc/filesystems) until the nfs-server.service is started. Manually starting the service allows `vagrant up` to continue.\r\n\r\nSo, https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/hosts/gentoo/cap/nfs.rb needs a `check_installed` method to check for the systemd service if systemd is installed, and use the default method if it is not. Here is the relevant method that fails on my system: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/plugins/hosts/linux/cap/nfs.rb#L52-L57\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\n1.9.3 (but the relevant code hasn't changed in newer versions)\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nGentoo (on my system NFS in kernel provided by modules, not compiled-in)\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nUbuntu (but the guest doesn't matter, this is a host issue)\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\nUncommented line from https://github.com/StackStorm/st2vagrant/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L28\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \"/home/cognifloyd/path/to/packs\", \"/opt/stackstorm/packs.dev\", :nfs => true, :mount_options => ['nfsvers=3']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\n```\r\n<...>\r\nDEBUG host: Searching for cap: nfs_installed\r\nDEBUG host: Checking in: gentoo\r\nDEBUG host: Checking in: linux\r\nDEBUG host: Found cap: nfs_installed in linux\r\n INFO host: Execute capability: nfs_installed [#<Vagrant::Environment: /path/to/my/project>] (gentoo)\r\nERROR warden: Error occurred: It appears your machine doesn't support NFS, or there is not an\r\nadapter to enable NFS on this machine for Vagrant. Please verify\r\nthat `nfsd` is installed on your machine, and try again. If you're\r\non Windows, NFS isn't supported. If the problem persists, please\r\ncontact Vagrant support.\r\n<...>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n`vagrant up` works prompting to start the nfs service as needed.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nI had to manually run `systemctl start nfs-service` before nfsd capabilities were detected.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Use a gentoo host where the NFS server capabilities are compiled as kernel modules\r\n2. Add a NFS shared folder to a Vagrantfile\r\n3. `vagrant up`\r\n\r\n### References\r\nAre there any other GitHub issues (open or closed) that should be linked here?\r\nFor example:\r\n- GH-7629\r\n- GH-7630\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3198565061,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MzE5ODU2NTA2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3198565061","actor":null,"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-04T02:08:00Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
