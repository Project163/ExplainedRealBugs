Someone should really add an option to skip the TTY test. Unfortunately, I don't know Ruby.\r\n\r\nI've looked for ways to simulate a TTY on `stdin`, and while there are solutions, they add lots of complexity. So I tried something simpler: since Vagrant checks if `stdin`  is a TTY, we can trick it into believing it is by preloading a different version of the `isatty` function into the process.\r\n\r\nCompile this small piece of C into a shared object:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n/* isatty.c */\r\nint isatty(int fd) {\r\n    return 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`gcc -o isatty.so -fPIC -shared isatty.c`\r\n\r\nThen launch Vagrant with your synthetic input, but preload this SO:\r\n\r\n`yes N | LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/isatty.so vagrant box prune`\r\n\r\nThis should yield the desired result: I've tested it with `vagrant destroy` which gives the same error if called after a pipe. It is clearly a hack since this will make every single file descriptor passed to `isatty` look like a TTY and we are messing with standard function.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/502849632/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"binary-manu","id":47382117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzgyMTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47382117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu","html_url":"https://github.com/binary-manu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary-manu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/510262013","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10908#issuecomment-510262013","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10908","id":510262013,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDI2MjAxMw==","user":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-10T23:00:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T23:00:25Z","body":"Hi
