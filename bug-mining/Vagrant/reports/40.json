When a VirtualBox host-only interface without an IPv6 address is created, it would still get an `fe:*` address. This causes VirtualBox to attempt to reach such addresses. The problem arises when the interface does not have any virtual machine attached to it. For example, I have a network adapter with IPv4 configured with no VMs:\n\n```\nName:            vboxnet4\nGUID:            786f6276-656e-4474-8000-0a0027000004\nDHCP:            Disabled\nIPAddress:       192.168.60.1\nNetworkMask:     255.255.255.0\nIPV6Address:     fe80:0000:0000:0000:0800:27ff:fe00:0004\nIPV6NetworkMaskPrefixLength: 64\nHardwareAddress: 0a:00:27:00:00:04\nMediumType:      Ethernet\nStatus:          Up\nVBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-vboxnet4\n```\n\nIt does have an IPv6 address, but that's an auto-configured address (not something I setup). The interface itself is up, but is not in the RUNNING state at this point and attempting to reconfigure it fails:\n\n```\nvboxnet4: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500\n        inet6 fe80::800:27ff:fe00:4  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>\n        ether 0a:00:27:00:00:04  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)\n```\n\nvagrant should only attempt to validate and reconfigure routes for interfaces that are actually in use by a machine, not just all interfaces. I will submit a PR to fix that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
