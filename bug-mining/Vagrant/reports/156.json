Since I closed this, VirtualBox has added support for VBoxSF on FreeBSD hosts as well as guests.\r\n\r\nHi guys! When I boot a FreeBSD guest with my Vagrantfile, I receive the following message.\r\n`Vagrant is not able to mount VirtualBox shared folders on BSD-based guests. BSD-based guests do not support the VirtualBox filesystem at this time.`\r\nThe error goes on to state that this is not a bug in Vagrant, however this is untrue.\r\nWith the port [virtualbox-ose-additions](http://www.freshports.org/emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions), \r\none can simply run `mount -t vboxsf Vagrant /vagrant` to mount the VirtualBox Shared Folder inside a FreeBSD guest. They function the exact same as they would in Linux, at this point.\r\n\r\n### Vagrant version\r\nVagrant 1.9.5\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nFreeBSD 11.0 x64\r\n\r\n### Guest operating system\r\nFreeBSD 11.0 x64\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n```ruby\r\n# -*- mode: ruby -*-\r\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\r\n\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n  config.vm.box = \"freebsd/FreeBSD-11.0-RELEASE-p1\"\r\n  config.ssh.shell = \"sh -c 'SH_ENV=/etc/profile exec sh'\"\r\n\r\n  config.vm.define 'dev-genericname', autostart: false do |genericname|\r\n\r\n    genericname.vm.box = 'freebsd/FreeBSD-11.0-RELEASE-p1'\r\n    genericname.vm.network \"private_network\", type: \"dhcp\"\r\n    genericname.vm.base_mac = \"macaddress\"\r\n\r\n    genericname.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |vb|\r\n      vb.name   = \"genericname\"\r\n      vb.memory = 1024\r\n      vb.cpus   = 1\r\n    end\r\n\r\n# Provisioning stuff\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note, if you are using Homestead or a different Vagrantfile format, we\r\nmay be unable to assist with your issue. Try to reproduce the issue using a\r\nvanilla Vagrantfile first.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nGuest should mount shared folder\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nVagrant claims freebsd has no support for shared folders\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Download FreeBSD vagrantbox from atlas\r\n2. Write vagrantfile\r\n3. `vagrant up freebsdvm`","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8884/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
