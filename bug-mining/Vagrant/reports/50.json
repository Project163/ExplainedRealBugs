applications to use the lovely new `ansible_local`, and running into a few issues.\n\nIn my Vagrantfile, I have:\n\n```\nconfig.vm.provision \"ansible_local\" do |ansible|\n    ansible.provisioning_path = \"/my-app/playbooks\"\n    ansible.playbook = \"site.yml\"\n    ansible.inventory_path = \"development\"\n    ansible.extra_vars = {\n      is_vagrant: true,\n      should_seed: true,\n      source: \"/my-app\"\n    }\n    ansible.verbose = \"vvvv\"\n  end\n```\n\nValues have been scrubbed and simplified. Many of them actually inspect environment variables to determine there value, preventing me from moving them to my inventory group_var file.\n\ndefault values defined in `group_vars/all` is `is_vagrant=false` and `should_seed=false`\n\nwhich generates (what looks correctly): \n\n``` bash\ncd /my-app/playbooks && PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true ansible-playbook --limit='default' --inventory-file=development --extra-vars={\"is_vagrant\":true,\"should_seed\":true,\"source\":\"/cirro-legacy\"} -vvvv site.yml\n```\n\nBut then I get (in a dummy task created to display variable output):\n\n```\nTASK: [common | display vars] *************************************************\n<default> REMOTE_MODULE command echo \"is_vagrant=False should_seed=False source=/cirro-legacy\" #USE_SHELL\n```\n\nI can work around this temporarily, but _something_ seems amiss.\n","closed_by":{"login":"gildegoma","id":434654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDY1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/434654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma","html_url":"https://github.com/gildegoma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gildegoma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6726/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
