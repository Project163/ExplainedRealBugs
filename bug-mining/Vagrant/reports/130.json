have the same issue as this older issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"nebffa commented on 16 Nov 2017 • \r\nI would like to be able to configure the 'automount' option for a shared folder for the VirtualBox provider.\r\n\r\nSee this VBoxManage command for how to add a new shared folder with the setting:\r\n\r\nVBoxManage sharedfolder add Windows-2016-Datacenter --name \"Stuff\" --hostpath \"/Users/ben/stuff/\" --automount\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nhi im pretty new to Vagrant but i have the same issue.\r\n\r\nwindows 10 box\r\n\r\nmy Vagrantfile has this line\r\n\r\nconfig.vm.synced_folder \"/Users/kevinrook/gocoedit/vagrant/windows/data\", \"/vagrant_data\"\r\n\r\nthe shared folder is visible in the VirtualBox Settings for the VM but the option AutoMount is not activated.\r\n\r\ni have to Vagrant up the box.   then shut it down.  open VirtualBox settings and edit the the share folder enabling the Auto Mount option.\r\n\r\nthen the next time i Vagrant up. the share folder is now visible in the Win 10 vm.\r\n\r\nis there an option i can add to the Vagrantfile to enable this from the start it would be great.\r\n\r\nim running: \r\nMacOS 10.13.5 (17F77)\r\nVagrant 2.0.2\r\nVagrant box \"Microsoft/EdgeOnWindows10\"\r\nVirtualBox 5.2.8 r121009 (Qt5.6.3)\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nKevin\r\n\r\nRelated:
