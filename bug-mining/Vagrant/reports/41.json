This appears to be due to the handling of routes for addresses of the type of `2001:dead:beef::` and that is the address Vagrant chooses for the adapter. The error is `no route to host`, although there appears to be a routing table entry for `2001:dead:beef::/64 dev vboxnetN`. When changing the adapter IP to `2001:dead:beef::1`, the communication proceeds as expected.\n\nI do  not understand the differences between the IPv6 stacks, but on Linux this issues does not manifest.\n\nGiven that there is no strong requirement to use `<prefix>::` as the IPv6 address for the adapter, I suggest changing it to `<prefix>::1`, akin to IPv4 configuration.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitchellh","id":1299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh","html_url":"https://github.com/mitchellh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
