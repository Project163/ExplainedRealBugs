- the debug link you shared doesn't show any file provisioners at all, just that your scripts are failing from a partial debug log. If you have a gist that shows the full output of running `vargant up --debug`, with the file provisioners all running, that would give us more information on if they are actually running and adding the files to the guest or not.

@mnuthan1 - I do see a file being provisioned, but it's hard to determine what is going on with a partial debug log.   __Again, please give us the _full_ debug log  from the beginning of running
