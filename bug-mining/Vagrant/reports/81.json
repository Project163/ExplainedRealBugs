The functionality broke in 1.9.4 and it's still broken in 1.9.5\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. install 1.9.5 or 1.9.4 of vagrant\r\n2. install the latest Virtual Box (I use Version 5.1.22 r115126)\r\n3. do a 'vagrant up' which will work\r\n4. do a 'vagrant ssh' and you will see the error above\r\n\r\n### References\r\nI previously asked on the vagrant google group, but got a non-answer blaming ruby for some reason, which is clearly incorrect.  This has worked fine for 2+ years on vagrant/virtualbox on windows.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
