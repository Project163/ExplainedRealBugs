I cannot scan the full file for sensitive information right now.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nVagrant successfully provisions the salt environment.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nVagrant executes the bootstrap_salt.ps1 file. The file is unable to download the salt minion. The bootstrap_salt.ps1 file never executes. Vagrant never exits. The issue is swallowed, because there is no local debug output. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Provide some fake salt config for the Vagrantfile above\r\n2. Execute \"vagrant up\"\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\nThis is caused by a network issue. When the bootstrapper attempts to download the file it received a 408: Request Timeout. When manually trying to execute the bootstrap later on it works. I can imagine that the bootstrap is executed when the network is not ready, yet. I will provide an approach to fix this in a little while.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nThe issue seems to be related to #8925. Without the fix provided in #8925 newer minion version will not download. However, this issue was also swallowed for me and the vagrant call never returned","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
