Most actions in Vagrant that require a TTY have configuration\r\nswitches to disable this requirement. Please do that or run Vagrant\r\nwith TTY.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that `vagrant box prune` has a \"configuration switch\" to disable the TTY requirement. \r\n\r\nI also understand that `vagrant box prune` has a `--force` option. This works if you don't want to keep the used VM box. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCouple of options:\r\n\r\n- Allow `vagrant prune box` to be run without a TTY such that  `yes N | command` will work\r\n- Add a new option to `vagrant prune box` that will skip the prompt but not delete any used VMs (this would be the opposite of --force)\r\n- Unknown third option?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
