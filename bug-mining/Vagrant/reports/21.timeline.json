For now, this should be the responsibility of the powershell script and perhaps we ought to update the docu to spell out the obvious - non-0 exit codes result in build failures.\n\nAnyway, I'll implement the same change locally and if these issues disappear i'll push later on today.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/packer-community/packer-windows-plugins/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/packer-community/packer-windows-plugins/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3212271160,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MzIxMjI3MTE2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/3212271160","actor":null,"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-08T02:21:49Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
