But it could not have been, because vagrant trigger is using `Shellwords.split` which is a function that is expected to split a unix shell command line and not a windows command line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/5daa25db806f15e8150e57f5c9292c56cc2f5e95/lib/vagrant/plugin/v2/trigger.rb#L159-L164\r\n\r\nAfter that first parsing, vagrant trigger incorrectly constructs the command line by just joining the arguments with a  space:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/5daa25db806f15e8150e57f5c9292c56cc2f5e95/lib/vagrant/util/powershell.rb#L119-L136\r\n\r\nand that ends up executing the incorrectly constructed command line:\r\n\r\n`[\"powershell\", \"-NoLogo\", \"-NoProfile\", \"-NonInteractive\", \"-ExecutionPolicy\", \"Bypass\", \"-Command\", \"vagrant ssh -c cat /vagrant/tmp/*.ssh_known_hosts | sudo tee /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts jenkins\"]`\r\n\r\ndue to the missing single-quotes in the `-c` argument value.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I was able to create the command line by escaping the arguments with:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n        # escape single quotes with another single quote.\r\n        command = command.map{|arg| \"'#{arg.to_s.gsub(\"'\", \"''\")}'\"}.join ' '\r\n\r\n        c = [\r\n          executable,\r\n          \"-NoLogo\",\r\n          \"-NoProfile\",\r\n          \"-NonInteractive\",\r\n          \"-ExecutionPolicy\", \"Bypass\",\r\n          \"-Command\",\r\n          \"#{env}&#{command}\" # AND by adding an & in here\r\n        ].flatten.compact\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn sum, vagrant triggers should be modified to use a proper windows command line parsing function and it should properly create a command line by escaping all the arguments.","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/10393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
