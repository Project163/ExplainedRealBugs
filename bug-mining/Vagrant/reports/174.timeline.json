If you have a folder structure where `edata` is inside of `data`, and you ignore the top level folder `data, then `edata` won't be synced because you told rsync to ignore its parent directory...\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier I believe the issue seems to be that the watcher only seems to be watching the top most directory level of a folder, and doesn't seem to pick up any sub
