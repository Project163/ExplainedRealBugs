For us, the fix seems to be simple as [this PR](https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/pull/453). More question in comment https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-service-manager/pull/453#discussion_r99364513 as\r\n> No way that this gets executed twice by design. Either there is a bug in Vagrant or we are missing something else. \r\n> If there is indeed something we need to workaround we need a better patch than this. What if for some reason we need another communicator call somewhere else? How would one kn ow/remember to add this next statement. If there is a workaround needed we need to provide a way to apply this workaround to all potential uses of the communicator, for example by adding our own helper/utility method around the communicator here.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce*\r\n- vagrant init projectatomic/adb\r\n- vagrant plugin install vagrant-service-manager\r\n- vagrant up\r\n- vagrant service-manager install-cli docker\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
