I'm going to close this as fixed. The previous comment (https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7011#issuecomment-263952842) provides a nice list of paths that work and paths that fail. For the paths that need the backslash escaped, there is no way around that. It is simply a syntax thing and must be addressed by the user when creating the file. For the last two paths that reference a `server`, these are unsupported by virtualbox and should not be expected to work.\r\n\r\nIf you do find that you are still encountering problems, please either reopen this ticket or create a new one.
