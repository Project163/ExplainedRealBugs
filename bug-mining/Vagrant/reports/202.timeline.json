I am using the Vagrant Docker provider with Docker version:\r\n\r\n```pre\r\n$ docker --version\r\nDocker version 17.04.0-ce, build 4845c56\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Vagrantfile\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\n\r\n  config.vm.provider \"docker\"\r\n\r\n  nodes = [\r\n    'consul0',\r\n    'vault0',\r\n    'nomad-server0',\r\n    'nomad-client0',\r\n    'nomad-client1',\r\n    'nomad-client2'\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n  nodes.each do |node|\r\n    \r\n    config.vm.define \"#{node}\" do |n|\r\n      n.vm.hostname = \"#{node}\"\r\n      n.vm.provider \"docker\" do |d|\r\n        d.name = \"#{node}\"\r\n        d.remains_running = true\r\n\r\n        # Use the official Docker images for Consul and Vault and\r\n        # build a custom image for Nomad because an official image\r\n        # does not exist.\r\n        case\r\n        when \"#{node}\".include?(\"consul\")\r\n          d.image = \"consul\"\r\n        when \"#{node}\".include?(\"vault\")\r\n          d.image = \"vault\"\r\n        else\r\n          d.build_dir = \".\"\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug output\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/nrvale0/fde1e0f6ad1ff03e65dbf82fb778cb96\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n'vagrant destroy -f' results in kill of all containers and rmi of all container images built from bundled Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nDestroy operation fails because multiple containers share an image and Docker will not rmi a container image if a container exists which is using the image.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Copy the Vagrantfile somewhere convenient.\r\n1. (vagrant up && vagrant destroy -f) > /tmp/log 2>&1\r\n\r\n### References\r\nNone of which I am aware.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/301658528","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7245#issuecomment-301658528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7245","id":301658528,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTY1ODUyOA==","user":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-16T02:34:25Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T02:34:25Z","body":"One workaround in the latest release is to enable the compose option to use the `docker-compose` driver which can properly handle destroying images when used by multiple containers.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/301658528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/335296652","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7245#issuecomment-335296652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7245","id":335296652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTI5NjY1Mg==","user":{"login":"ZhixiongCai","id":16983218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTgzMjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16983218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai","html_url":"https://github.com/ZhixiongCai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZhixiongCai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-09T21:32:43Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T21:32:43Z","body":"There are errors in the configuration of this machine.
