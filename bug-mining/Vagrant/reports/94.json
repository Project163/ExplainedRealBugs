Vagrant version\r\n* Experienced with all versions ``>1.8.1``, including ``2.0.1``\r\n* Does NOT happen on ``1.8.1``\r\n\r\n### Host operating system\r\nUbuntu 16.04, also experienced on Ubuntu

behavior\r\nThe hostname entry in /etc/hosts point to ``127.0.0.1``\r\n\r\n### Investigation\r\n\r\nI traced the issue back to the following commit: https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/commit/dbb2d992785c7f8cf23bd04f1dbc1e4c1dbe41f4\r\n\r\nIt erroneously sets the hostname to ``127.0.0.1``. In Debian, ``127.0.0.1`` is supposed to point to ``localhost``, and the hostname itself points to ``127.0.1.1``\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nFix the /etc/hosts file manually\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a fix for vagrant and will report back.","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
