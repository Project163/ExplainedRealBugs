use a privately-hosted box catalogue. When specifying boxes in a Vagrantfile, it is possible to do something along the following lines:\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.vm.box_url = \"https://.../our-box.json\"\nconfig.vm.box_download_client_cert = \"/path/to/client.cert\"\nconfig.vm.box_download_ca_cert = \"/path/to/ca.cert\"\n```\n\nDoing `vagrant up` then works, with Vagrant successfully downloading the box. However, `vagrant box outdated` and `vagrant box update` fail, since `Vagrant::Box.load_metadata` has no support for supplying any custom certificates.\n\nI'd be happy to submit a pull request implementing this functionality if you could advise me on the right way to approach it. It seems a little tricky, since `box_download_client_cert` and `box_download_ca_cert` are attributes of the machine and not of the
