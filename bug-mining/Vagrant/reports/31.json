However, many boxes in the public catalog follow semantic versioning.\n\nor\n\n> you're free to use versions however you'd like!\n\nBut I couldn't find any mention that Vagrant doesn't support parsing _all_ versions compatible with the Semantic Versioning Specification, and can only cope with a limited subset (i.e. it doesn't support pre-release versions like `0.0.1-foo`, nor build metadata like `0.0.1+20150729`).\n\nThe documentation should mention that the only supported format is X.Y.Z; there is a runtime error message, but people will only find it _after_ generating their metadata.json (packer post-provisioning etc.), which is annoying.\n\nEven the runtime error message is under-specified: it doesn't qualify that Z must be an integer only.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
