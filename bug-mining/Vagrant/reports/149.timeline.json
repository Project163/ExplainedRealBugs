Would this also work for `vagrant box outdated`?\r\n\r\nI agree that it could be a little verbose if there is an update, but personally I favour some or more information over no or less information.\r\n\r\nAn alternative (for `vagrant up`) could be:\r\n```\r\n$ vagrant up\r\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'ubuntu/bionic64 (virtualbox, 20181024.0.0)' ...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. That way it would be easier to match against the output from `vagrant box list`:\r\n```\r\n$ vagrant box list\r\nubuntu/bionic64 (virtualbox, 20181018.0.0)\r\nubuntu/bionic64 (virtualbox, 20181024.0.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet another alternative could be to show a message prompting the user to update if there is a newer version (as is the case now), otherwise show the current version and indicate that it is up to date, for example:\r\n```\r\n$ vagrant up\r\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\r\n==> default: Box 'ubuntu/bionic64' version '20181024.0.0' is up to
