Looking at the Linux version of these capabilities, I don't see why this shouldn't be supported on the platform. linux/cap/insert_public_key.rb looks like it could be copied to darwin verbatim and only a small change is needed to linux/cap/remove_public_key.rb to make it work with the awkward BSD variant of sed:\n\n``` ruby\n    \"sed -i '' '/^.*#{contents}.*$/d' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n```\n\nor if you want to make it less obscure and save a backup file (it shouldn't change the security of things as sshd will simply ignore the backup file):\n\n``` ruby\n    \"sed -i.bak '/^.*#{contents}.*$/d' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitchellh","id":1299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh","html_url":"https://github.com/mitchellh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/5204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
