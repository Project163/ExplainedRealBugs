further follow up, I determined that it may be a host system issue.\r\n\r\nFrom my Mac OSX host `/etc/exports` I determined two things:\r\n\r\n1. Running `sudo nfsd restart` was required\r\n2. I found I was able to export a further up root path `/Users` but not `/Users/myuser/whatever`. (Once `/Users` is mounted, one can still mount things deeper within it though...)\r\n\r\nThis was determined by using `vagrant ssh` and then running `showmount -e <host ip>`. This was the same IP Vagrant tried to use. I already had another VM (as mentioned docker-machine-nfs) and it showed up when I ran this. It is mounting my `/Users` so I tried duplicating it and pointing to my vagrant IP and after `sudo nfsd restart` voila the Vagrant IP showed up on the Vagrant box's showmount output.\r\n\r\nSo I am effectively having to use `nfs_export: false` and define it myself.\r\n\r\nI have not determined the cause yet - another developer has an almost identical setup sans docker-machine-nfs and it \"just works\". We both have the same folder ownership/group permissions around /User and our respective user sub-folders.\r\n\r\nVagrant is adding the right /etc/exports, to the right ip, but either nfsd is not restarting properly to pick it up, or my folders are only able to be exported from high up in the folder hierarchy.\r\n\r\nI wish I had an easier repro or fix, such as specific ownership or how to share it with nfsd's group but I hope my debugging steps can help someone else get to the bottom of their situations.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nTo help a little more, I forgot to mention after adding the `/Users` mount and the right IP showing up in showmount output, I then successfully manually mounted the nfs mount. Here is the actual mount command, it's basically the same thing that Vagrants output prints, but this may help someone in need:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo mount -o vers=3,udp 192.168.50.1:/Users/me/path/to/code /vagrant\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do have to run this each time I up the box, unfortunately","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/438475587/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"r4j4h","id":703007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzAwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h","html_url":"https://github.com/r4j4h","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r4j4h/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/504450029","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8704#issuecomment-504450029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8704","id":504450029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDQ1MDAyOQ==","user":{"login":"mryanb","id":3656391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTYzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3656391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb","html_url":"https://github.com/mryanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mryanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-21T14:38:59Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T14:38:59Z","body":"Also running into a similar issue if I start more than 1 vagrant host, appears to coincide with a recent upgrade to `macOS 10.14.5 (18F132)`. \r\n\r\n- Running `Vagrant 2.2.4`\r\n- Running `showmount -e localhost` only displays 1 NFS path. /etc/exports indicates there should be 2.\r\n\r\nReverting to shared folders for now ☹️\r\n\r\nErrors I was seeing:\r\nvagrant reload on second host\r\n```\r\nThe following SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.\r\nVagrant assumes that this means the command failed!\r\n\r\nmount -o vers=3,udp 10.80.1.1:/Users/me/Sites/some-site/webroot /var/www/vagrant\r\n\r\nStdout from the command:\r\n\r\nStderr from the command:\r\n\r\nmount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting 10.80.1.1:/Users/me/Sites/some-site/\r\n```\r\nvagrant reload\r\n```\r\nNFS is reporting that your exports file is invalid.

Catalina has been annoying me since it was released (Catalina is a bad woman, isn't she?). I used to have this problem. I fixed the problem. So I wanted to write things I did .\r\n\r\nMy environment is this now:\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯❯❯ sw_vers\r\nProductName:\tMac OS X\r\nProductVersion:\t10.15\r\nBuildVersion:\t19A583\r\n\r\n❯❯❯ vagrant --version\r\nVagrant 2.2.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Things I did\r\nI had to update `Vagrantfile` and `/etc/exports`.\r\n\r\nBut first, I did this:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\n❯❯❯ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest\r\n❯❯❯ vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually, I don't know whether this action is effective for this problem or not.

Like this:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\n❯❯❯ sudo vi /etc/exports\r\n# VAGRANT-BEGIN: 501 3cee32a0-9e19-4a6e-94b0-2f042dbc9180\r\n\"/System/Volumes/Data/Users/seiyamaeda/[DIR-NAME]/\" xxx.xxx.xx.xx -alldirs -mapall=501:20\r\n# VAGRANT-END: 501 3cee32a0-9e19-4a6e-94b0-2f042dbc9180\r\n\r\n❯❯❯ sudo nfsd restart # For refreshing this config\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, I reloaded Vagrant.\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯❯❯ vagrant reload\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, this problem vanished.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/541548149/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maecha","id":1400860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1400860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha","html_url":"https://github.com/maecha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maecha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/541553665","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8704#issuecomment-541553665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/8704","id":541553665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTU1MzY2NQ==","user":{"login":"kwn","id":3968616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3968616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn","html_url":"https://github.com/kwn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-14T08:33:14Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T08:33:14Z","body":"@seiyamaeda \r\n\r\nThis might work if I'm the only user of the Vagrant file, or the whole development team uses MacOS.
