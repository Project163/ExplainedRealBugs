The salt.minion_id setting of \"footest\" does not appear anywhere in the /etc/salt tree on the minion. \n\n# A stripped-down Vagrantfile that produces the issue.:\n\n```\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\n\n  config.vm.box = \"../vagrant-centos-7.2-minimal.box\"\n  config.vm.hostname = \"minion01\"\n  config.vm.provision :salt do |salt|\n    salt.minion_id = \"footest\"\n    salt.install_type = \"stable\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\n(Edit - Further stripped down originally posted Vagrantfile.)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/253960859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brianholland99","id":20098965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDk4OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20098965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99","html_url":"https://github.com/brianholland99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/254011595","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7454#issuecomment-254011595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7454","id":254011595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDAxMTU5NQ==","user":{"login":"brianholland99","id":20098965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDk4OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20098965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99","html_url":"https://github.com/brianholland99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T21:15:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T21:15:30Z","body":"I read the commit message on the patch. It did question whether the get_masterless was the proper abstraction. A slight change might work by pulling the setting of minion_id outside of check \"if @config.masterless\", assuming the variable being set is used in the case of a real master. The posted examples of the issue seemed to be using masterless. Mine does not, so it probably just needs to be done globally as minion_id should be relevant for all cases.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/254011595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brianholland99","id":20098965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDk4OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20098965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99","html_url":"https://github.com/brianholland99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianholland99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":982880379,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk4Mjg4MDM3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/982880379","actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-02T00:50:08Z","label":{"name":"has-pr","color":"fef2c0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1126000072,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTEyNjAwMDA3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/1126000072","actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-15T23:01:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/606993511","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7454#issuecomment-606993511","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/7454","id":606993511,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNjk5MzUxMQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/receiv
