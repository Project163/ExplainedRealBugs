Folders.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/170981594/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jsternberg","id":1212129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1212129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg","html_url":"https://github.com/jsternberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":512658143,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTEyNjU4MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/512658143","actor":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-12T17:23:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":512658144,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxMjY1ODE0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/512658144","actor":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-12T17:23:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/173347380","html_url":"https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6835#issuecomment-173347380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/6835","id":173347380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzM0NzM4MA==","user":{"login":"jsternberg","id":1212129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1212129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg","html_url":"https://github.com/jsternberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-20T20:1

is it possible to look at my PR? The request isn't to modify how Vagrant mounts shared folders. I just want Vagrant to add the shared folder and not perform the mount. I think the PR I created in #6836 does this in a way that's consistent with how it was suggested in the issues I linked to.\n\nThe PR gives a lot more flexibility so it is possible to mount the drive to locations created by the provisioner script.\n\nThanks.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/comments/173347380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jsternberg","id":1212129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTIxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1212129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg","html_url":"https://github.com/jsternberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsternberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":520864828,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIwODY0ODI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/520864828","actor":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-20T20:17:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":520864829,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMDg2NDgyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/520864829","actor":{"login":"sethvargo","id":408570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODU3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo","html_url":"https://github.com/sethvargo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethvargo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-20T20:17:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":852322793,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg1MjMyMjc5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/events/852322793","actor":{"login":"chrisroberts","id":266674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c3438ff8f6a18a466f6a73bec4ce5d176bf78ce8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisroberts/vagrant/commits/c343
