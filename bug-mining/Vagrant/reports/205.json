Linux builds official Arch Linux Vagrant images under the namespace (Archlinux/Archlinux) on vagrant cloud. We are constantly trying to reduce the image size. Today I've encountered a bug report for our images, where a user tried to use the network segment: https://github.com/archlinux/arch-boxes/issues/70\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\r\nconfig.vm.box = \"archlinux/archlinux\"\r\nconfig.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.0.50\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis failed, because our image doesn't provide netctl (the next version will possibly do, but I am interested in a change of the Arch plugin).\r\n\r\nArch Linux ships `systemd` in their default installation, with `systemd` `systemd-networkd` is available. I have to admit, that I am not a big fan of netctl, I think most of the features are covered by `systemd-networkd` (Ethernet) and `iwd` (wifi).\r\n\r\nTherefore I would like to request a change of the Arch network plugin. I don't know ruby, but the particular lines I would like to change are here:\r\nhttps://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/85acf0cac724ef4bfda593a66e0c17f7e4110da0/plugins/guests/arch/cap/configure_networks.rb#L42L49\r\n\r\nA quick fix would be to install netctl (either in the image or via the plugin), but on the long term I would like to have `systemd-networkd` been used in this plugin. Is there an easy way to accomplish this? I guess you have already some sort of `systemd-networkd` network provider?","closed_by":{"login":"briancain","id":810277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain","html_url":"https://github.com/briancain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11254/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
