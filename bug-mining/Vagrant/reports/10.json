When specifying boxes in a Vagrantfile, it is possible to do something along the following lines:\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.vm.box_url = \"https://.../our-box.json\"\nconfig.vm.box_download_client_cert = \"/path/to/client.cert\"\nconfig.vm.box_download_ca_cert = \"/path/to/ca.cert\"\n```\n\nDoing `vagrant up` then works, with Vagrant successfully downloading the box. However, `vagrant box outdated` and `vagrant box update` fail, since `Vagrant::Box.load_metadata` has no support for supplying any custom certificates.\n\nI'd be happy to submit a pull request implementing this functionality if you could advise me on the right way to approach it. It seems a little tricky, since `box_download_client_cert` and `box_download_ca_cert` are attributes of the machine and not of the box.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitchellh","id":1299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh","html_url":"https://github.com/mitchellh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitchellh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/4420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/4420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
