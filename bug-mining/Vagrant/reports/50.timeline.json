was about to open a pull request... but since @gildegoma mentions it is not necessary for the `ansible` provisioner my quick fix might break something there.\n\nsince the ansible documentation uses single quotes around the `extra_vars` JSON (http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html#passing-variables-on-the-command-line) i hacked string formatting into `plugins/provisioners/ansible/provisioner/base.rb`:\n\n```\n        def extra_vars_argument\n          if config.extra_vars.kind_of?(String) and config.extra_vars =~ /^@.+$/\n            # A JSON or YAML file is referenced.\n            config.extra_vars\n          else\n            # Expected to be a Hash after config validation.\n            \"'#{config.extra_vars.to_json}'\"\n          end\n        end\n```\n\nand then the ruby hash is properly passed on to ansible as a single quoted JSON string.\n\n~~another workaround is \"escaped double quoting\":~~\n\n```\n    ansible.extra_vars = {\n      \"\\\"service_name\\\"\": \"\\\"djboot\\\"\"\n    }\n```\n\nEDIT: that does not work when using more than one element in the hash. then bash interprets the `{}` as array.\n\nthe resulting `--extra-vars={\"\\\"service_name\\\"\":\"\\\"foo\\\"\"}` then does not loose the escaped doublequotes. otherwise the shell (bash, sh) eats the doublequotes:\n\n```\n$ echo

I also supported nested single quotes for all 3 options that are quoted now.\n\nThis fix is checked with `ansible` provisioner (as it might have appeared broken because of the suggested fix).

is a work in progress and currently (probably) doesn't work with:\n- `ansible_local`\n- correct `post_provisioning_scripts` paths\n\nI'm adding my initial proof of concept described in https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/issues/305#issuecomment-156702888 as well as some docs on how to set it up.\n\nWould be great to get some feedback and suggestions, so I'm opening this PR for more discussion. Personally I really like this setup as it's fairly simple, doesn't add too much code and allows me to store Drupal VM as a git submodule.\n\nIn the discussion I linked to @frob discovered one drawback though. You need to provision the machine in the project root, as the `.vagrant` directory needs to be created in the same location as the delegating `Vagrantfile` or else multiple `.vagrant` folders will be created. Actually now that I think about it, it's probably only an issue if you go through the delegat**ed** Vagrantfile from Drupal VM.\n\nI honestly don't think that scenario is worth fixing...
