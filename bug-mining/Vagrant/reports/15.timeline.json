like #5021 was fixed in Vagrant 1.7.2. However Vagrant still fails to clean up the node and client off the Chef Server.\n\nThe two lines in my Vagrantfile:\n\n```\nchef.delete_node = true\nchef.delete_client = true\n```\n\nLog from trying to destroy a VM:\n\n```\nvagrant destroy\n\n    latest: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'latest' VM? [y/N] y\n==> latest: Forcing shutdown of VM...\n==> latest: Destroying VM and associated drives...\n==> latest: Pruning invalid NFS exports. Administrator privileges will be required...\n==> latest: Running cleanup tasks for 'chef_client' provisioner...\n==> latest: Deleting client \"latest\" from Chef server...\n==> latest: Cleaning up the 'client' for Chef failed. The stdout and\n==> latest: stderr are shown below. Vagrant will continue destroying the machine,\n==> latest: so please clean up these resources manually.\n==> latest: \n==> latest: stdout: Check your configuration file and ensure that your private key is readable\n==> latest: \n==> latest: \n==> latest: stderr: WARNING: No knife configuration file found\n==> latest: ERROR: Your private key could not be loaded from /etc/chef/client.pem\n==> latest: Deleting node \"latest\" from Chef server...\n==> latest: Cleaning up the 'node' for Chef failed.

Presumably the chef cleanup is being run as the root user?\n- Is it an order thing, is the VM being destroyed or cleaned up before running the chef cleanup, and that file no longer exists? \n\nMaybe some more insight as to how the cleanup works can help figure out why this doesn't work. I'd really like to stop using the vagrant-butcher plugin to achieve this functionality.
