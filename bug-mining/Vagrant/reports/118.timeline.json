ran into this as well, using Chef's bento/ubuntu-18.04 image, though my host is macOs.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the problem is that Ubuntu 18 has renamed that package to `python3-software-properties`, but [Vagrant's Ubuntu guest provisioner](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/blob/de1c28aad0f92d05364fbfb9015b9b44d8c8ae10/plugins/provisioners/ansible/cap/guest/ubuntu/ansible_install.rb#L22) is quietly installing `python-software-properties` and `software-properties-common`, in order to get the add-apt-repository program so that it can add the `ansible/ansible` PPA.\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18, however, seems to ship with `add-apt-repository` already installed, so it seems like the appropriate fix in Vagrant is to check to see if that program already exists, and if not, then install the appropriate packages.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, I worked around this by specifying in my Vagrantfile that I want Ansible to be installed via pip: `ansible.install_mode =
