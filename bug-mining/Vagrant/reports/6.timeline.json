running with a docker host proxy (i.e. not boot2docker w/ rsync) to support synced_folders from the host machine, the folders are shared only on the original container that is brought up in the \"cmd\".  When you use `vagrant docker-run`, the folder is not shared from the host machine.\n\nGiven a Vagrantfile for a vagrant docker proxy host:\n\n``` ruby\nVAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = \"2\"\n\nVagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|\n  config.vm.box = \"phusion/ubuntu-14.04-amd64\"\n  config.vm.hostname = \"dockerproxy\"\n  config.ssh.forward_agent = true\n\n  config.vm.provision \"docker\"\nend\n```\n\nand a Vagrantfile for the docker container:\n\n``` ruby\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\n  config.vm.define \"myapp\" do |myapp|\n    myapp.vm.provider \"docker\" do |d|\n      d.image = \"phusion/baseimage\"\n      d.cmd = [\"/sbin/my_init\", \"--enable-insecure-key\"]\n      d.has_ssh = true\n      d.vagrant_vagrantfile = \"../path/to/Vagrantfile\"\n    end\n\n    myapp.ssh.username = \"root\"\n    myapp.ssh.private_key_path = \"phusion.key\"\n\n    myapp.vm.synced_folder \".\", \"/app\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWhen you  `vagrant up myapp --provider=docker` and then `vagrant ssh myapp`, you can see that the current directory is shared into /app.  However, if you do anything with docker-run, the share does not occur in the generated container (i.e. `vagrant docker-run myapp -t -- /bin/bash` will have an empty /app)\n\nNOTE:\n\nWhen you `vagrant up`, you get output like:\n\n```\n==> myapp: Docker host is required.

One will be created if necessary...\n    myapp: Docker host VM is already ready.\n==> myapp: Creating the container...\n    myapp:   Name: container_name_1400693746\n    myapp:  Image: phusion/baseimage\n    myapp:    Cmd: /bin/bash\n    myapp: Volume: /var/lib/docker/docker_1400693746_5232:/app\n    myapp: Volume: /var/lib/docker/docker_1400693746_54674:/vagrant\n    myapp:\n    myapp: Container is starting.
