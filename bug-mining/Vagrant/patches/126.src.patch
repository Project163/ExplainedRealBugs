+## Pageant on Windows
+
+The SSH executable will not be able to access Pageant on Windows. While
+Vagrant is capable of accessing Pageant via internal libraries, the
+SSH executable does not have support for Pageant. This means keys
+from Pageant will not be available for forwarding when using the
+`vagrant ssh` command.
+
+Third party programs exist to allow the SSH executable to access Pageant
+by creating a unix socket for the SSH executable to read. For more information
+please see [ssh-pageant](https://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant).
