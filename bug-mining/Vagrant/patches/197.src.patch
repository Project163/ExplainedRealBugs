+
+# Vagrant and macOS Catalina
+
+The latest version of macOS (Catalina) includes security changes that prevent
+applications from accessing data in your Documents, Desktop, and Downloads
+folders without explicit permission. If you keep any virtual machine files in
+these folders, you will need to allow access to these folders for your terminal
+emulator.
+
+Initially when you try to access one of these folders from the command line, you
+should see a popup that says something like:
+
+> “Terminal” would like to access files in your Documents folder.
+
+Click "OK" to grant those permissions.
+
+If you click "Don't Allow" and find that you need to grant access later on, you
+can go to "System Preferences" -> "Security & Privacy" -> "Files and Folders"
+and you should see your terminal emulator there. Click on the lock, and then
+click on the checkbox next to the folder that contains the files that Vagrant
+needs to access.
+
+Note that granting the `vagrant` binary "Full Disk Access" is not sufficient or
+necessary. If Terminal (or iTerm2/Hyper/etc.) is granted access to a particular
+folder, then Vagrant will also be able to access that folder.
