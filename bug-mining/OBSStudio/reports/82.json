OBS should close properly when exiting.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to stream locally in listener mode using SRT with the \"Start Streaming\" button, if no client connects to OBS to view the stream. OBS seems to close when clicking the exit button, but the process is still running (icon can be seen in the system tray) and not responsive. Closing OBS requires ending the process through task manager\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. In settings, set the service to custom and the server to srt://[local ip address]:[port]?mode=listener\r\n2. Click \"Start Streaming\" to begin stream\r\n3. Click \"Exit\" to exit OBS\r\n4. OBS seems to exit, but process is still running and icon will still be present in system tray\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nPlease provide an option to cancel the connection when attempting to stream in listener mode using SRT with the streaming function","closed_by":{"login":"robedpixel","id":18674579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc0NTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18674579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel","html_url":"https://github.com/robedpixel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robedpixel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
