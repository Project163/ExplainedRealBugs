Current Behavior\r\nUser can not change the scene name. For example, when OBS is fresh installed, user can change the default scene name from \"Scene\" to \"A new Scene Name\". Then, user is not able to change the scene name. When entered a new name, hit enter, the name stays the same. If the user adds new scene, none of the scenes can be renamed. The only way to \"rename\" is via duplication and provide a new name there.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Download and Install OBS\r\n2. Open OBS, skip configuration wizard\r\n3. Change the default scene name, succeed\r\n4. Change the name again, failed\r\n5. Add new scene and change its name, failed\r\n6. Duplicate an arbitrage scene, give it a new name, succeed\r\n7.

that code is for the Source list, not the Scene list.  This issue is about renaming _scenes_, not sources.  Renaming sources works just fine.  However, when renaming a scene, if you press the rename shortcut key (Return/Enter on macOS, F2 on Windows/Linux), the rename action will restart, discarding any changes you've made to the scene's name.\r\n\r\nI've discussed this at length in the Discord's development channel with @mtippett.  The Source list and the Scene list are handled by different classes.  The Source list has a lot of extra code handling edit start, stop, and finished events to prevent this sort of thing occurring there.  The Scene list does not have the same amount of code for it.  As implied by the commit you linked, and as I discussed on Discord, this comes down to the fact that editing is handled by Qt item delegates (editors), and any code preventing the restart of the edit action would have to be linked to the item delegate of the SceneTree, which is a subclassed
