Description\r\nRemoves thread from auto configuration code that was accessing UI objects and causing crashing. Given we immediately start and wait on the thread, it seemed largely pointless anyway.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nFixes illegal Qt behavior that caused a crash. Fixes https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5364.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nRan OBS, auto config loaded when it crashed before.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your PR introduce?
