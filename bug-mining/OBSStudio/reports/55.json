Set up the nvenc encoder to use the \"lossless\" rate control\r\n2. Start recording\r\n3. Observe how the log does not specify which encoder/codec is in use\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nLogs for reference.\r\n\r\nlossless, jim-nvenc:\r\nh264: https://obsproject.com/logs/8WYNWqNbFmzcTDMO\r\nhevc: https://obsproject.com/logs/oPZZ9j-eQD6R0tMK\r\n\r\n\r\nlossless, nvenc-ffmpeg:\r\nh264: https://obsproject.com/logs/5KlsBfhzgS2_0yI6\r\nhevc: https://obsproject.com/logs/22E3J1T41laZa2q1","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/6976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/6976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
