Same does the interact window of browser sources. Browser panels, thought, works correctly\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start OBS with PRIME render offloading\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nBy the log, the error is the following:\r\n`20:11:58.173: Cannot get window EGL surface: EGL_BAD_NATIVE_WINDOW`\r\n`20:11:58.173: gl_platform_init_swapchain  failed`\r\n`20:11:58.173: obs_display_init: Failed to create swap chain`\r\n\r\nthe command line used to run OBS is the following:\r\n`__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia obs --ignore-certificate-errors`\r\n\r\nthe error appear even if you remove the __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME option\r\n\r\nthe following is the list of shared library module loaded obtained via gdb: [https://pastebin.com/0MejUSP6](https://pastebin.com/0MejUSP6)\r\n\r\nThe preview runs correctly when running OBS without offloading (so, on integrated GPU). \r\n\r\nHere is the output of eglinfo: [https://pastebin.com/PQSEzfjP](https://pastebin.com/PQSEzfjP)\r\n\r\nI also noticed that another user on Discord had the same problem, but on Windows, so probably is not a O.S. related issue.
