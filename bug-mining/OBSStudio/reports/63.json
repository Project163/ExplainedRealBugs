Open OBS\r\n2. Open settings\r\n3. Open hotkeys\r\n4. Try to use print screen or a \"media control\" key as a hotkey\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nOther applications, such as Discord, properly recognize the keys you push. For example, I have Discord's push-to-talk set to SKIP TRACK, since I have that globally unbound on my desktop, and its in a convenient location on my keyboard. It's a convenient single key that nothing else uses, which will never conflict with anything else, to which theres no replacement on my keyboard, and OBS for some reason doesn't recognize.\r\n\r\nThis issue means that I cannot have both Discord and OBS set to the same push-to-talk hotkey, and have to come up with a difficult to use contrived hotkey thats acceptable to OBS and doesnt conflict with anything else.","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
