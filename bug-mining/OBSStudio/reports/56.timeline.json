In practice the X11\r\nserver does not support alpha windows so we dont need the alpha\r\ncomponent in our framebuffer. We previously had alpha specified in our\r\nframebuffer since we do alpha texturing but testing shows this isnt\r\nrequired for mesa/intel or nvidia drivers and we must pick a 24bit\r\nconfig for users to enable render offloading for mixed gpu systems.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nfixes #6984\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\ntested on an intel+nvidia ubuntu 22 system and firmed it fixes the issue. Tested on single gpu setups with nvidia and intel and nothing appears to have regressed.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your PR introduce?
