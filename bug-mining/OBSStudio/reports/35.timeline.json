Description\r\nFixes #5199 and an additional bug where the UI and internal state of the broadcast configuration isn't reset when force-stopping (e.g. when discarding remaining delayed stream

stopping a delayed stream (forced/unforced)\r\n- Tested force-stopping a delayed stream before it starts (to verify thread gets cleaned up)\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes
