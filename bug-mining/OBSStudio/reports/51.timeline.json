Description\r\n\r\nRearrange comparison order so that NaN is caught.\r\nComparisons with NaN always result in false.\r\nNaNs cause problems later in audio encoder.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nWhen a NaN (not a number) audio sample is fed to OBS, it immediately stops both streaming and recording because ffmpeg audio encoder doesn't like it.\r\n\r\nSee #4885, which this patch should theoretically fix, if compiler obeys IEEE semantics (no `-ffast-math` or so).\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI have not tested yet.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- Bug fix
