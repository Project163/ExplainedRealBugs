symbols may collide with external ones provided by\r\nlibcodec2.so which FFMPEG may pull in automatically. Changing\r\nthe visibility of these symbols will guarantee the use of the\r\ninternal ones and not pick some (potential incompatible) from\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nfixes #3561\r\n\r\n<!--- Please fill out the following template, which will help other contributors review your Pull Request. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Make sure you’ve read the contribution guidelines here: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail. -->\r\n<!--- If this change includes UI elements, please include screenshots. -->\r\nChange CMake compile options for RNNoise related source files when compiled on Linux.\r\n\r\nFixes a segfault on Linux where external symbols with the same name would would be picked to run instead of the local ones. Since they may not API/ABI compatible OBS will most likely segfault.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open Mantis issue, or implements feature request -->\r\n<!--- from the Ideas page, please link to the issue here. -->\r\n\r\nMake OBS not crash (when certain software is installed) when noise suppression filter is selected (as it defaults to RNNoise filter method).\r\nFixes a bug I reported earlier (see top description, commit message)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment (hardware, OS version, etc.),-->\r\n<!--- and the tests you ran, including how it may affect other areas of code. -->\r\n\r\nDebian/Sid amd64 (Ryzen 3700X, but bug is not hardware depended)\r\n\r\nTested with and without patch:\r\n- Without patch -> segmentation fault with callstack from obs-filter.so into external libcodec2.so.\r\n- With patch -> RNNoise filtering working as expected.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your PR introduce? Uncomment all that apply -->\r\nBug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n<!--- - New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) -->\r\n<!--- - Performance enhancement (non-breaking change which improves efficiency) -->\r\n<!--- - Code cleanup (non-breaking change which makes code smaller or more readable) -->\r\n<!--- - Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change) -->\r\n<!--- - Documentation (a change to documentation pages) -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
