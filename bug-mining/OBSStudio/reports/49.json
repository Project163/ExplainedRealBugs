Load up  camera\r\n2. Pick mjpeg\r\n3. Select any resolution\r\n...\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nTo me it seems to be with avcodec or the implementation of avcodec for decoding mjpeg. Testing qv4l2 to display an image, it works fine this program atleast from what I can tell it's own decoder to decode mjpeg.\n\nEdit:\nCamera model: avermedia pw513\n\nThis is the only camera that acts up that I have.\nDoes not work properly in guvcview\nWorks in qv4l2 though.","closed_by":{"login":"GeorgesStavracas","id":3518204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTgyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3518204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas","html_url":"https://github.com/GeorgesStavracas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
