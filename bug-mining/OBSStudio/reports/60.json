Please fix this thx!):\r\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/689462361\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nVideo Example\r\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/688793653\r\n\r\n1. On Ubuntu Bionic Beaver 18.04 bit and OBS 25.0.8 64 \r\n2. Plug in an analog audio device\r\n3. Plug in a USB microphone (USB PnP Audio Device, in my case a FIFINE Studio Condenser T669) \r\n4. (unknown) have one or more USB microphones and/or audio output devices plugged in after\r\n5. Start, Restart, or switch profiles on OBS and begin streaming\r\n\r\n(unknown) order of steps 4 and 5 or if this is a factor\r\n\r\nSuccessful Reproduction of Issue:\r\nMicrophone audio will be picked up instead of Desktop Audio. Expected Desktop Audio will be either completely mute or nearly inaudible. \r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\nMay be related to push to talk and push to mute functionality, but I believe I've been encountering this issue before using these settings.
