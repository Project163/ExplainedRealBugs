Even with a leading `/` in \"filename formatting\".\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nIt simply does not save the screenshot, due to a trailing space in the folder name (invalid on windows).\r\n`C:/Users/Chris/Videos/Screenshot /2021/May` is not a place that exists, and cannot be written to. The folder will get created, but without the trailing whitespace.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Modify Settings -> Advanced -> Recording -> filename formatting to start with a `/`. For instance `/%CCYY/%MM-%DD %hh-%mm-%ss`\r\n2. Hit OK/Save\r\n3. Trigger a screenshot thru right clicking the canvas -> Screenshot (source)\r\n4. Observe how in the log, the screenshot is \"saved\" to a path that is invalid.\r\n5. Observe that the folder does not have a screenshot.\r\n...\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nThere is a decent use case for having the folder structure split up by different dates/years, and it works fine, its just that screenshots do seem to be named with a whitespace at the end. This would either need to be changed, or perhaps a push for separate screenshot naming (like we have to replay buffer) is in order.\r\n\r\nThis exists in the latest RC, as well as on release.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"notr1ch","id":876345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/876345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch","html_url":"https://github.com/notr1ch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4707/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
