Feedback welcome.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/941350/146666926-7f55db99-eb52-4e20-a478-923ed416090c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/941350/146666860-59354a11-ee90-4177-b9e8-7cbfb7be3201.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n* UI shouldn't display items that are unsupported/incompatible/do nothing.\r\n\r\n* Fixes #5136\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. On Windows, enable `BUILD_TESTS` in CMake and add a \"20x20 Random Pixel Texture Source (Test)\" source\r\n2. On macOS, add a Window Capture source.\r\n3. Open the Filters window\r\n4. Under \"Audio/Video Filters\" click the + (Add) button\r\n5. Notice the list provided, and try clicking an audio filter then adding it\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code has
