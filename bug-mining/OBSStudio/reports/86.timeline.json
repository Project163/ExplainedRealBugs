Direct Display uses extensions:\r\nVK_KHR_display/VK_EXT_direct_mode_display\r\nThis workflow allows creating swapchains that arn't active on the desktop, so they don't have HWNDs.\r\nAvoid trying to create swap_data when a HWND can't be found.\r\n\r\nFixes #11581\r\n\r\n<!--- Please fill out the following template, which will help other contributors review your Pull Request. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Make sure you’ve read the contribution guidelines here: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nVK_KHR_display/VK_EXT_direct_mode_display extensions created swapchains without HWND handles.\r\nAvoid trying to work with HWND when they can't be found.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nThe old behavior causes crashes when applications using Direct Display.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe only thing I tested was that the crash doesn't occur. If avoiding filling the `swap_data` has\r\ngreater ramifications, then I'll need feedback from devs more familiar with OBS.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
