The filter on other sources are unaffected, until you change its source settings.\r\n- Completely deleting the source, adding a new source of the same type (image, video device, etc), adding the filter, does not fix it. It still produces black. However, you can add the filter to existing sources of the same type, and it will work.\r\n- Restarting OBS seems to be the only way to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe log indicates something is going wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\n18:38:25.817: [DShow Device: 'Video Capture Device'] settings updated: \r\n18:38:25.817: \tvideo device: Mevo-2BNJ2\r\n18:38:25.817: \tvideo path: \\\\?\\usb#vid_046d&pid_d119&mi_00#7&175b2019&0&0000#{65e8773d-8f56-11d0-a3b9-00a0c9223196}\\global\r\n18:38:25.817: \tresolution: 1280x720\r\n18:38:25.817: \tflip: 0\r\n18:38:25.817: \tfps: 30.00 (interval: 333333)\r\n18:38:25.817: \tformat: MJPEG\r\n18:38:25.817: \tbuffering: disabled\r\n18:38:25.817: \thardware decode: disabled\r\n18:38:26.353: [NVIDIA Video Effect: 'NVIDIA Background Blur Filter'] Error running the BLUR FX; error -9: The specified pixel format is not accommodated\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add a source\r\n2. Add the nvidia background blur filter to it\r\n3. Change any setting on the video capture source\r\n4. The filter will produce black output\r\n5.
