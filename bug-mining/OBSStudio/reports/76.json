In the terminal is the log linked before, and this last line not shown in the log file:\r\n`obs: symbol lookup error: /usr//lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/obs-plugins/obs-qsv11.so: undefined symbol: MFXLoad`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nTesting was done on a fresh install of PopOS.\r\n1. Install Intel GPU drivers from this link: https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/installation.html#ubuntu-install-steps\r\n```\r\nsudo apt install bison flex intel-fw-gpu intel-gsc intel-level-zero-gpu intel-metrics-discovery intel-metrics-library level-zero libfl-dev libfl2 libigc1 libigdfcl1 libmetee libsigsegv2 libz3-4 m4 xpu-smi\r\nsudo apt install intel-opencl-icd intel-level-zero-gpu level-zero intel-media-va-driver-non-free libmfx1 libmfxgen1 libvpl2 libegl-mesa0 libegl1-mesa libegl1-mesa-dev libgbm1 libgl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dri libglapi-mesa libgles2-mesa-dev libglx-mesa0 libigdgmm12 libxatracker2 mesa-va-drivers mesa-vdpau-drivers mesa-vulkan-drivers va-driver-all vainfo hwinfo clinfo\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Install OBS beta using the PPA:\r\n```\r\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio-unstable\r\nsudo apt install obs-studio\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Change recording settings to use QSV\r\n4. Start recording, which causes OBS to close.\r\n\r\n### Anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nNot sure yet if this is just an issue with my setup, but QSV seems to work fine in ffmpeg (using jellyfin-ffmpeg6). This is the closest issue I could find to this one: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/9316. Would be great to get this working with an Arc card in linux, thanks","closed_by":{"login":"RytoEX","id":624931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/624931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX","html_url":"https://github.com/RytoEX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/9573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/9573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
