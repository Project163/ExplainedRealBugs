So OBS Studio needs to run with the xcb backend. I changed the .desktop file to add `/usr/bin/env QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` to the start of the Exec line and *then* added it to Steam, and that allows OBS Studio to start and go through first-time setup while in game mode.\r\n\r\nYou can't actually capture anything, though. Gamescope does expose a Pipewire stream, but for some reason, OBS Studio isn't loading up Pipewire support at all. Is Pipewire only enabled for the Wayland backend?

the title says, Gamescope needs to add support for Wayland clients\r\n\r\nFor example If you try to run a SDL2 game with `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland` under gamescope, then gamescope won't touch it at

hard this would be to achieve because you use wlroots (I've tried running nested `sway` with the output scale set to below 1 for one of gamescope's nice features (aka downsampling) and it kinda works

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail. -->\r\n<!--- If this change includes UI elements, please include screenshots. -->\r\nSome wayland compositors exclusively use xwayland such as gamescope. This allows us to fallback to the platform determined by Qt, which will detect these exotic compositors and handle them correctly when not overidden by this envvar.\r\n\r\nQt preserves this undesired behavior until 6.3. With ubuntu 22 on 6.2 this workaround needs to be preserved.\r\n\r\nfixes #6386\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?
