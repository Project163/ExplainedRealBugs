Description\r\nVLC Video Source overrides height and width attributes of video from libvlc to exactly match the source file.

Only works for local video files - video streams will still be incorrect (https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2933) and will need to be dealt with separately.\r\n\r\nCause: previously, the buffer size passed from libvlc was being used as the video size, but this was often incorrect as the buffer size could be rounded up to the next multiple of 32. This was then \"fixed\" by getting the pixel size of the original video file, however it didn't take into account rotation or aspect ratio attributes. This PR addresses this.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18594548/132258767-5c5e10f5-7ff5-4f8f-a284-b2341cb59948.png)\r\n#### After\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18594548/132389383-bb205624-2b3a-498a-9c54-9062dcc45c54.png)\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nFixes #5250 - portrait videos (e.g. from phones) being rendered with incorrect aspect ratio.\r\nAlso fixes #3843\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested on macOS 11.5.2 on Intel and 12.3.1 on Apple silicon. Ran several videos of different dimensions and rotations through VLC Video Source and aspect ratio is now correct for all of them.\r\n\r\nTest videos generated with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nffmpeg -f lavfi -i \"testsrc=duration=10,drawtext=text='rotation 180':fontcolor=white,transpose=clock,transpose=clock\" -c libx264 -f mpegts - | ffmpeg -i - -c copy -metadata:s:v rotate=180 rotation180.mp4\r\nffmpeg -f lavfi -i \"testsrc=duration=10,drawtext=text='rotation 270':fontcolor=white,transpose=clock\" -c libx264 -f mpegts - | ffmpeg -i - -c copy -metadata:s:v rotate=90 rotation270.mp4\r\nffmpeg -f lavfi -i \"testsrc=duration=10,drawtext=text='rotation 90':fontcolor=white,transpose=cclock\" -c libx264 -f mpegts - | ffmpeg -i - -c copy -metadata:s:v rotate=270 rotation90.mp4\r\nffmpeg -f lavfi -i \"testsrc=duration=10,drawtext=text='aspect ratio':fontcolor=white,scale=iw*2:ih,setsar=1/2\" aspect.mp4\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd to VLC Video Source - these should all render the same size:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18594548/166231717-7b57e1b7-4ae6-4e7d-bd10-35d24841e975.mp4\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18594548/166231721-3f56123d-9012-479b-870a-4ce18c8c0143.mp4\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18594548/166231722-e8d1a670-4291-48a6-86ab-ebbb2cce433e.mp4\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18594548/166231723-8cab08c4-32cc-462e-ae42-2ba739484ec1.mp4\r\n\r\nOther
