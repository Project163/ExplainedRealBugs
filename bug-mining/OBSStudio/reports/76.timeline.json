This causes our library searching with pkg-config hints to instead search for the first dependency of VPL.\r\n\r\nInstead just import the pkg-config definition directly and use it. This is a bit more correct as all the dependencies will be correctly linked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?
