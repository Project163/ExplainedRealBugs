Examples:\r\n\r\n- [Google Chrome] Item-0\r\n- [OBS] Item-0\r\n- [OBS] (all main OBS windows/settings windows)\r\n- [Window Server] Backstop Menubar\r\n- [Window Server] Desktop\r\n- [Window Server] Menubar\r\n- [TextInputMenuAgent] Item-0\r\n- [Spotlight] Item-0\r\n\r\n## Platform\r\n<!-- Please fill out the following information about your bug report. -->\r\n<!-- If you are on Linux and installed using a package, please list the package type. -->\r\nOperating system and version: macOS 10.15.5 Catalina\r\nOBS Studio version: 25.0.8\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nSystem windows should not be displayed in window capture.\r\nWe currently have a blacklist for these items on Windows OS,\r\nand this should be expanded to include items on macOS.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nWindow capture lists system windows not designed for capture.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open OBS\r\n2. Add Window Capture\r\n3. Check the list and observe several nonsense and Item-0 options in the list that are not actual windows.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\nN/A","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
