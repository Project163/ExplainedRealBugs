It's more of a workaround, so this has to be tested by others. The flag is required for the main preview, since it'll freeze otherwise when restoring obs after minimizing it, but disabling it just for projectors fixed the issue without affecting the main preview or the preview in properties/filter dialogs.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nDisabled the attribute in [UI/window-projector.cpp#L33](https://github.com/univrsal/obs-studio/blob/efbfe9bf9da0fd6680934219ef16bb6771e80c22/UI/window-projector.cpp#L33) for all systems that use X11.\r\nMight need another check to not disable the attribute if Wayland is used.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nResizing projectors is not possible under KDE otherwise without using workarounds listed in #3582.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nProjectors and multiviews can be resized again. This was tested on Arch Linux under KDE Plasma 5.23.4 with KDE Frameworks 5.89.0 and Qt 5.15.2 as well as under Kubuntu. It was also tested under Cinnamon, which doesn't have the resizing bug, but the change introduced no regressions there.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your PR introduce?
