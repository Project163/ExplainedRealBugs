Max replay size should be determined by time set by a user\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nCurrent max size is 512 mb by default. It can be adjusted by switching recording to CFV or CQP and changing a drawn field value in replay buffer settings. Changing recording back to CBR preserves the value for replay buffer.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Enable replay buffer\r\n2. Set bitrate of replay to 150 mbit/s\r\n3. Set duration to 10 minutes\r\n4. Start replay buffer\r\n5. Save replay buffer after 30+ seconds.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\nFirst time reported here:\r\nhttps://obsproject.com/forum/threads/why-is-max-memory-used-option-isnt-available-on-cbr-for-replay-buffer.109878/\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"notr1ch","id":876345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/876345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch","html_url":"https://github.com/notr1ch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2516/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
