I'm still experiencing this issue ([see my question on the OBS forums](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/weird-ui-artifact-glitch-after-installing-obs-on-linux-mint.139216/)), is there a permanent fix for this?\r\n> \r\n> I'm using OBS (v26.1.1) on Mint (v20.1 - Cinnamon) on a Dell 4k monitor running at double (Hi DPI) user interface scale. I can run `export QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1.2` and launch OBS from the command line for a quick/incomplete fix but I have no such luck launching the app from the desktop icon or task bar.\r\n\r\nYou could edit your obs.desktop to fit with the correct launching command.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/779160674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Aisyk","id":5584650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODQ2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5584650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk","html_url":"https://github.com/Aisyk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aisyk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/790536832","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4031#issuecomment-790536832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4031","id":790536832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDUzNjgzMg==","user":{"login":"Metagit","id":21952653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTUyNjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21952653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit","html_url":"https://github.com/Metagit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Metagit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T11:12:55Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T12:42:10Z","body":"I am also still experiencing this issue.
