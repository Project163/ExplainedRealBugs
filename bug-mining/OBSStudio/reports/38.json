This usually happens 1 week in advance (it is a church service).\r\n2) On the day of the event, go into OBS Manage Broadcast (authorisation to the Google account has already been established).\r\n3) Choose the 'select predefined broadcast tab' and choose the event defined in step 1; \r\n4) Select Broadcast and start streaming; \r\n5) Wait for YouTube Studio to show Preview of Broadcast with Excellent Connection; \r\n6) Press OBS Go Live - and the stream should go live.  \r\n\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nAs above - but Stepo 6 did not work\r\n6) Press OBS Go Live - and the stream did not go live.\r\nAn error was written to the OBS Logfile - which I think is related to this call to [ResetBroadcast](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/7d5c11de2daf5fce61f8e39de276d5e8110cb890/UI/youtube-api-wrappers.cpp#L408)\r\n7) I have to go to YouTube Studio to press the Go Live button.\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1) Configure the LiveStream broadcast event in YouTube Studio. This usually happens 1 week in advance (it is a church service).\r\n2) On the day of the event, go into OBS Manage Broadcast (authorisation to the Google account has already been established).\r\n3) Choose the 'select predefined broadcast tab' and choose the event defined in step 1; \r\n4) Select Broadcast and start streaming; \r\n5) Wait for YouTube Studio to show Preview of Broadcast with Excellent Connection; \r\n6) Press OBS Go Live. No error is reported to the user, but the logfile shows this error:\r\n22:42:40.884: YouTube API error:\r\n22:42:40.884: \tHTTP status: 403\r\n22:42:40.884: \tURL: https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/liveBroadcasts?part=id,snippet,contentDetails,status\r\n22:42:40.884: \tJSON: {\"error\": {\"code\": 403, \"errors\": [{\"domain\": \"youtube.liveBroadcast\", \"message\": \"Modification on enableMonitorStream is not allowed in current status\", \"reason\": \"enableMonitorStreamModificationNotAllowed\"}], \"message\": \"Modification on enableMonitorStream is not allowed in current status\"}}\r\n\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nWe are not enabling AutoStart on the YouTube event as we want to run the stream in Test mode for a while to confirm network connection is stable.\r\n\r\nThe workaround of going live in YouTube Studio is acceptable - but it would be good to have the Go Live feature working.\r\n\r\nI think that the issue might be that ResetBroadcast is always trying to set enableMonitorStream to false - but it must be true to allow a testing (Preview) stage before live.
