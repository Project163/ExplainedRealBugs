Call `obs_data_item_set_default_obj` or `obs_data_item_set_default_array` with valid objects.\r\n2. Call `obs_data_item_set_obj` or `obs_data_item_set_array` with valid or invalid objects.\r\n3. Call `obs_data_item_get_default_obj` or `obs_data_item_get_default_array`.\r\n4. Returned values mismatch actual default objects. Objects are now inaccessible.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n1. https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/libobs/obs-data.c#L1763-L1766\r\n2. https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/libobs/obs-data.c#L1768-L1771\r\n\r\nThis was accidentally found while testing the libobs validation layer I built to verify my plugin against. An obs_data test would always fail, despite being correct in theory, so investigation revealed that these two functions are the cause.","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3357/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
