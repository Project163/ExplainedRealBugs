Basically it can't reach it. I am wondering why it reports a connection at all even if the server is down. If I stop the stream OBS gets caught in a stopping stream loop. It shows stopping stream forever and the stream bottom becomes unresponsive.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. SRT Server is down\r\n2. Start the stream to the SRT server\r\n3. Stop the stream to the SRT server\r\n...\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"pkviet","id":9283407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9283407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet","html_url":"https://github.com/pkviet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
