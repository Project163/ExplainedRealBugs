However, since 27.2's release, we've heard reports that while Mic/Aux capture works correctly (verified), Desktop Audio does not (also verified).\r\n\r\nThis locks the work queue code behind a Windows 10 check. \r\n\r\nI did attach a debugger to a debug build of OBS but none of the `throws` were hit, and I don't understand the code well enough to track down what could be happening.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n* Fixes #5967\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n* Launch OBS on Windows 8.1\r\n* Play audio\r\n* Notice it's captured\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n - Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] My code has been run through [clang-format](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/.clang-format).\r\n-

Operating System Info\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n### Other OS\r\n\r\nWindows Server 2016 Datacenter Edition\r\n\r\n### OBS Studio Version\r\n\r\n27.2.3\r\n\r\n### OBS Studio Version (Other)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### OBS Studio Log URL\r\n\r\nhttps://obsproject.com/logs/HDv_ArGz4pRbSRuq\r\n\r\n### OBS Studio Crash Log URL\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nOBS should capture desktop audio and show the stereo meter (two green bars) moving in the audio mixer.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nOBS silently fails to capture audio and shows a single mono bar with no activity.\r\n\r\n- Attempting to switch audio capture sources changes the monitor to display stereo bars and a brief peak of audio activity (regardless of actual audio) which then disappears.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n~~1. Add audio output source in a blank scene collection~~\r\nEdit: This was actually tested by simply attempting to record/monitor desktop audio, either via \"Default\" device or selecting USB audio.\r\n\r\n### Anything else we should know?\r\n\r\n- I'm 99% sure this is the same issue as https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5967\r\n- Microphone capture works fine, as in the above mentioned issue.\r\n\r\n- WizardCM's fix, https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/5980, looks good, but unfortunately does not apply to Windows Server 2016 because **the version check for Windows 10+ includes WS2016.**\r\n\r\nTo verify that WASAPI work queue is the issue, I've recompiled OBS Studio from source myself and **manually set rtwq_supported to false**.  **I've verified that this fixes the issue in my build**.  Replacing the rebuilt win-wasapi.dll plugin alone in a precompiled release binary also solves the issue.\r\n\r\nI imagine that Windows Server 2016 is an extremely niche environment for OBS so you may have to take my word for it that this is broken.  The desired fix is pretty simple here, the problem is implementing the version check.  I've looked into this a little bit myself but I'm a bit hesitant to submit a PR as a first-time contributor because it didn't seem trivial.\r\n\r\nThere are a few existing threads out there about this sort of thing which I'm sure you can find yourself.\r\nThis particular stackoverflow answer seems to be elucidating, as an example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/61212831\r\n\r\n**I can confirm that my \"ReleaseId\" is 1607 in my registry.**  Here are the relevant other values from HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrentBuild: 14393\r\nCurrentBuildNumber: 14393\r\nCurrentMajorVersionNumber: 0x0000000a (10)\r\nCurrentMinorVersionNumber: 0x00000000 (0)\r\nCurrentVersion: 6.3\r\nEditionID: ServerDatacenter\r\nInstallationType: Server\r\nProductName: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter\r\nReleaseId: 1607\r\nUBR: 0x0000138e (5006)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like you're already parsing ReleaseId, but only in crash handlers and not actually keeping it in the win_version_info struct.\r\n\r\nGiven that Windows Server is relatively obscure as a desktop environment, I'm happy to test a fix and/or provide additional diagnostics if you'd like to direct me.
