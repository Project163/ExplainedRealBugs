Open the OBS Studio Settings window\r\n2. Under Audio, choose Enable Push-to-talk on Audio Input Capture (Pulseaudio)\r\n3. Under Hotkeys, type \"push\" to filter irrelevant items, and press a relevant key such as Right Control or a mouse button\r\n4. Click OK to apply the settings and close the window.\r\n5. Click off the window, press relevant key / button, and notice missing audio input in any scene which has it as a source (you may need to add it if you have a fresh configuration, I am not sure).\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nThis is under X11 and Pulseaudio, as opposed to Wayland and Pipewire. Package build instructions are at https://dev.getsol.us/source/obs-studio/browse/master/package.yml, as you can see we only apply one patch from related to CMake, otherwise it is stock OBS Studio.","closed_by":{"login":"GeorgesStavracas","id":3518204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTgyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3518204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas","html_url":"https://github.com/GeorgesStavracas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4843/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
