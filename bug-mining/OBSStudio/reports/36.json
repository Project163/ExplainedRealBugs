Connect an account for example YouTube\r\n2. Switch to another service like Twitch for example\r\n3. Click the use stream key option and enter a valid stream key\r\n4. Apply settings and try to start a stream\r\n5. YouTube event creation dialog will open instead of the stream starting on twitch\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nProbably happens with all services that have account linking when you switch to another service when using a stream key.\r\n\r\nSwitch to another service and linking the account will correctly unlink the old account.","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
