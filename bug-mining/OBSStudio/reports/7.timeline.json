Media source object is rewritten in to use states and a message queue.\r\n By moving to a state enumerator, the state can be guaranteed through\r\n each iteration of the message loop. This should greatly reduce race\r\n condition concerns. Also broke each message into its own function that\r\n can be logically modified to change behavior later.\r\n\r\n Additionally, a message queue is created to handle events from other\r\n threads. A function pointer allows new states to be added easily. The\r\n queue also features a bit flag to ensure any given state only appears\r\n once.\r\n\r\n Makes code more readable, will make future feature implementation\r\n easier, and provides a more efficient execution loop.\r\n\r\n<!--- Please fill out the following template, which will help other contributors review your Pull Request. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Make sure you’ve read the contribution guidelines here: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR includes two key changes to the media source file:\r\nFirst, states are changed from being a bunch of flags to a discrete state enumerator. This makes it easy to understand what is happening at any given time, and makes code much more readable.\r\nSecond, events are now handled by a message queue. This queue is fairly standard, but has the unique feature of providing a flag table to ensure any given message is pushed only once. \r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nSeeks to improve code readability and efficiency of media source loop.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested any combination of media events, and provided properties in the media source settings panel. Tested multiple sources and scenes. \r\n\r\nTested with Windows 10 18363 on a AMD Ryzen 3900x.\r\n\r\nChanges should be encapsulated to the media file, but the event signalers may be relevant to obs-ffmpeg-source if the new structure changes the logic in an unanticipated way.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your PR introduce?
