https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nOBS currently does not remove signal handlers due to an invalid string comparison. While other checks on the operation passed, matching the title of the call-back was checking to see if the strings were not equal. Flipping the operation to an `== 0` will correct this.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nThis solves issue #3218\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nRunning the supplied script at https://gist.github.com/alexdean/87cb0c087b85cb529559086b319c832f provided a suitable test case. I was able to confirm that with these changes, the call-back was properly being removed.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [X] My code has been run through [clang-format](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/.clang-format).\r\n- [X] I have read the [**contributing**

#3218 also exists for the lua implementation. The fix is simply changing the `!=` to `==` in [obs-scripting-lua.c:line 459](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/cab32e7e67c2a78d10e0961f746ee7408978fb43/deps/obs-scripting/obs-scripting-lua.c#L459)\r\n\r\n## Platform\r\nOperating system and version: All platforms\r\nOBS Studio version: 21.0 - 26.2rc2\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nCalling `signal_handler_disconnect` in lua should remove the signal handler callback.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nThe callback is either not removed or if it's registered for multiple signals on one signal handler the wrong signal is disconnected.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Save and load the following script:\r\n```lua\r\nobs = obslua\r\n\r\nfunction h1(cb)\r\n    print(\"handler 1 called\")\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction h2(cb)\r\n    print(\"handler 2 called\")\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction script_load()\r\n    local obs_sh = obs.obs_get_signal_handler()\r\n    obs.signal_handler_connect(obs_sh, \"source_volume\", h1)\r\n    obs.signal_handler_connect(obs_sh, \"source_activate\", h1)\r\n    obs.signal_handler_connect(obs_sh, \"source_activate\", h2)\r\n    obs.signal_handler_disconnect(obs_sh, \"source_activate\", h1)\r\n    print(\"h1 should be registered with volume changes and h2 with activation\")\r\nend\r\n```\r\n2. Open the script log\r\n3. Try activating a source and changing a volume level\r\n4. See that handler 1 and handler 2 both trigger on source activation, instead of handler 1 on volume changes and handler 2 on activation\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3841/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4629963344,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2Mjk5NjMzNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/events/4629963344","actor":{"login":"1div0","id":3098510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTg1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3098510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0","html_url":"https://github.com/1div0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1div0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"db7e02eee725d8529e553ef490a1fa758b51fe02","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/1div0/obs-studio/commits/db7e02eee725d8529e553ef490a1fa758b51fe02","created_at":"2021-04-22T10:37:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/841338793","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3218#issuecomment-841338793","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3218","id":841338793,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTMzODc5Mw==","user":{"login":"vivi90","id":1502082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDIwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1502082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90","html_url":"https://github.com/vivi90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vivi90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-14T16:05:34Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T16:05:34Z","body":"Okay
