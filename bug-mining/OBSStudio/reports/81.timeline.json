The video is black although the audio is decoded fine. The manual copy of metadata introduced in commit [1] does not work any more for some unfathomable reasons.\r\nAs a fix we call instead the av_frame_copy_props function used in FFmpeg app in a similar context (hardware decoding) [2].\r\nThe metadata are copied without issues.\r\nThere is no need to guard the use of that function since it was introduced 9 years ago in avutil/frame.c.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/commit/22fde5cdcd1c784cd60b8a8cd50af02e7e537182\r\n[2] https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/master/fftools/ffmpeg_dec.c\r\n\r\nNB: on FFmpeg master as of today (3/15/24), the relevant line I've copied is \r\nhttps://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blame/master/fftools/ffmpeg_dec.c#L336\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nHW decoding works again with Media Source when one plays an RTMP stream.\r\nHW decoding still works for local media files.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) \r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code has been run through [clang-format](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/.clang-format).\r\n- [x] I have read the [**contributing** document](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).\r\n- [x] My code is not on the master branch.\r\n- [x] The code has been tested.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are properly formatted and commits squashed where appropriate.\r\n- [x] I have included updates to all appropriate documentation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/2000539812","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10369#issuecomment-2000539812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10369","id":2000539812,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAMnsBs53PdCk","user":{"login":"pkviet","id":9283407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9283407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet","html_url":"https://github.com/pkviet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-15T22:01:07Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T22:01:07Z","body":"The
