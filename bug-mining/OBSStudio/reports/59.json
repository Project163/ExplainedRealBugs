If I do not have the application open then it should be black.   If I do have the application open then it should show the application.   This is how it worked in the previous flatpak version of OBS.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nEvery time I launch OBS, it changes the window capture target in my scene to whatever options is at the to for new window captures.   It remembers the cropping but not the target application.  It did not use to do this.   I have to set the correct target every time I launch the application.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1.  Launch OBS\r\n2.  See that  a scene with Window capture is on the wrong target\r\n3.  Launch the application\r\n4.   See that  a scene with window capture is still on the wrong target.\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nMost of the time it defaults to my desktop.   Sometimes it defaults to Discord if I have Discord open.","closed_by":{"login":"GeorgesStavracas","id":3518204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTgyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3518204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas","html_url":"https://github.com/GeorgesStavracas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GeorgesStavracas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
