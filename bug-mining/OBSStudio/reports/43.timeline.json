I'm using Arch Linux and upgraded to OBS v27 and my Mouse4 button no longer works as push to talk. Looking at the sound bar when I press the PTT button, it goes high for almost a tenth of a second then quickly fades to zero, even when still pressed. Downgrading to v26 from pacman cache works and the issue is not here on this version.\r\n\r\nAfter mapping PTT to the Q key for testing (in v27) it _does_ work, so I think it's only mouse buttons. Turning off PTT for the audio input device works too, though then it's always recording so I prefer to stick to v26 and working PTT for now.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/864456910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"quickishfm","id":47328894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzI4ODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47328894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm","html_url":"https://github.com/quickishfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quickishfm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/922059583","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4843#issuecomment-922059583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4843","id":922059583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAMnsBs429YM_","user":{"login":"Moondarker","id":4098364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTgzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4098364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker","html_url":"https://github.com/Moondarker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moondarker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-17T20:22:29Z","updated_at":"2021-10-05T12:38:43Z","body":"Can

When I press mouse 4 or mouse 5, that action is activated.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nWhen using mouse 4 or mouse 5 as a hotkey, they don't work. Notably, I tried to use them as a hotkey for push to talk, and the push to talk doesn't activate every time I press it, and when it does activate, it only activates for a fraction of a second. When using as other hotkey actions it doesn't appear to work at all. Mouse 3 or other mouse buttons work fine, as well as all keyboard buttons.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cee9df2b-1aae-4371-9d41-b08ab6ff5695\n\nIn the video I've set my middle mouse (mouse 3) and one side mouse button (mouse 4) to be able to toggle one of the window inputs. When the OBS window pops up in the top left, I'm using mouse 3, but as you see my mouse jiggle a little, I'm hitting mouse 4 and nothing is happening.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Add mouse 4 or mouse 5 as a hotkey to any action.\n2. Attempt to use.\n3. Watch as it doesn't work.\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nIssue #8517 is basically the same issue, but it's marked as closed and the real issue is with using those mouse buttons as hotkeys in general, not just with push-to-talk. There seems to be no response to my request to re-open, so I'm making a new issue. Also related is issue #4843.\n\nThis bug becomes an issue on obs-studio 27.0.0, but works perfectly on obs-studio 26.1.2. Flatpack build has the issue as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/12276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/12276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
