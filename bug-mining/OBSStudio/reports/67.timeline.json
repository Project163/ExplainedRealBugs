This is in line with what happens with rtmp (just try with a faulty rtmp address): the same message is shown and auto-reconnect is also stopped.\r\n\r\n- No the popup window either for rtmp or now for srt can not be deactivated. You have to click manually to dismiss the window.\r\n\r\n- The popup won't show up in case of initial successful connection and later a network issue; the auto-reconnect will be triggered.\r\n\r\nI understand that the popup window doesn't work with your current setup but there's no alternative, I'm afraid. I won't do anything different from rtmp. And your suggestion of stopping the stream manually won't work; the only option will be to fully exit obs (unless, if you were a dev, you  make a custom build to prevent the popups.
