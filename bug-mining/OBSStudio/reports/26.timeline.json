include screenshots. -->\r\nWith the same approach as in #4225, fix the canvas resolution calculation in the auto-config utility. This fixes #4298.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nThe current release version of OBS has several issues when determining the canvas resolution. This initially occurred due to the Qt update to 5.15.2. While this was fixed for a new profile in a previous commit, I fixed it in the settings screen in #4225. However, now I noticed that thanks to #4298 that I did not adjust this in the auto-config utility. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds this.\r\n\r\n_Note: In the filed issue, @energizerfellow mentioned that OBS calculates a weird output resolution for screens >4096 pixels in either dimension. Maybe that's worth looking into? I haven't checked this issue and this PR won't change anything to it, but given that this fix will usually cause an increase in the determined canvas resolution, I think it might be worth looking into at some point._\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nHardware: Microsoft Surface Book 2\r\nOperating System: Windows 10 Pro ver. 2004 (10.0.19042.746)\r\nScreens:\r\n3000x2000 internal screen @ 200% DPI Scaling\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) \r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code has been run through
