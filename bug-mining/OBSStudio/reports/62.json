After that, it will not start again until my next reboot.  Each click on the \"Start Virtual Camera\" button inserts a single line of text into the log:\r\n`04:00:54 PM.094: Failed to start virtual camera`\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Reboot\r\n2. Launch OBS\r\n3. Click \"Start Virtual Camera\"\r\n4. Click \"Stop Virtual Camera\"\r\n5. Click \"Start Virtual Camera\".  The button text remains the same (\"Start Virtual Camera\") and the VC is never started.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nThis began happening immediately after an OS upgrade from Ubuntu 20.10 to 21.04.
