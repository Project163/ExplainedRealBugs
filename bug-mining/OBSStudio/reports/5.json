The text does become editable and I type the new name and press the return key.  At that point the name goes back to the original name and is not renamed as it should have been.  The only thing I can do to get around this is to recreate the entire scene using the correct name in the first place and then delete the old one I no longer need.\r\n\r\nI only have 1 Scene Collection\r\nUsing MacOS Catalina 10.15.5 - All Updates\r\nMackbook Pro (2017 - 15Inch - 3.1 Ghz Quad Core i7 - 16GB Ram)\r\nOBS Studio 25.0.8 (64-Bit) - Downloaded Main Installer\r\nVLC 3.0.10 - 64 Bit\r\nLatest Version of Final Cut Pro\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
