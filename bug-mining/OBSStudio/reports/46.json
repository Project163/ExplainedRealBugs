Add a new trasition type Stinger\r\n2. In Properties try to add a video file with extension .mxf\r\n\r\n### Anything else we should know?\r\n\r\nOn Windows i'm able to slect (*) in the drop down liste of acceptable file extension in Stinger properties. (So which is not the case on Mac)\r\nSo on Windows .mxf is usable in Stinger properties. But can be enven better to have mxf in the supported extension file list.\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/5870/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
