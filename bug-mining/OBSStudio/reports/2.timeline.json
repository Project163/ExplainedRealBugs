Description\r\nDon't allow unsupported Vulkan formats to fall back to B8G8R8A8.\r\nProbably better to fail completely than do an illegal copy.\r\n\r\nAlso remove bad conversion for VK_FORMAT_A2R10G10B10_UNORM_PACK32.\r\nRed and blue channels were reversed, and there's no DXGI equivalent.\r\n\r\nAddresses #2796. We can do more later if justified.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nAMD noticed we weren't handling VK_FORMAT_A2R10G10B10_UNORM_PACK32 correctly.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nHacked up vkcube to test VK_FORMAT_A2R10G10B10_UNORM_PACK32 (not working with appropriate logging), and VK_FORMAT_A2B10G10R10_UNORM_PACK32 (working).\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code has been run through [clang-format](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/.clang-format).\r\n- [x] I have read the [**contributing** document](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).\r\n- [x] My code is not on the master branch.\r\n- [x] The code has been tested.\r\n- [x] All commit messages are properly formatted and commits squashed where appropriate.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2921/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3368712891,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMzNjg3MTI4OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/events/3368712891","actor":{"login":"guohai","id":436781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjc4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/436781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai","html_url":"https://github.com/guohai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"06fad68429deef21145b8da8bba6bb0a8985cbda","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AgoraIO-Community/obs-studio/commits/06fad68429deef21145b8da8bba6bb0a8985cbda","created_at":"2020-05-25T03:50:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/680402808","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2796#issuecomment-680402808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2796","id":680402808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDQwMjgwOA==","user":{"login":"WizardCM","id":941350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/941350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM","html_url":"https://github.com/WizardCM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-26T01:14:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-26T01:14:27Z","body":"Per the above & the linked PR that was merged, closing this as By Design / Won't Fix.
