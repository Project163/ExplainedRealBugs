This *seems* a bit excessive, but I don't know how the internals of `spa_pod_builder` work, so once I confirmed this I didn't look too much farther to see if we're leaking something temporarily there.\r\n\r\nThis results in the \"changes\" we think we're making to the relevant formats (removal of incompatible modifier) not taking effect, so we push either identical, or null changes through to pipewire, which realizes there's no change, and never triggers a change event on either end.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be a bad idea to add some defensive coding to prevent the \"trying the same params twice\" case to prevent an actual logic issue in the future, but in the immediate time frame, simply increasing the buffer size from 2048->4096 resolves it (at least with my hardware). IMO, these buffers should either be dynamically resizable or *far* larger than that to cover future use cases like more metadata. While there's a time for the assumption around a max buffer size, this negotiation is hopefully seldom. I'm not yet any kind of decent at SPA, so I didn't take a crack at it yet, but I can :)\r\n\r\nIf you want an easy way to confirm this overflow, just break at the end of `build_format_params`, and if any element of `params` is NULL that doesn't correspond to a `format_type` that has already exhausted its list of qualifiers, then the builder has overflowed.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with what the *expected* behavior of passing `NULL` values to `pw_stream_update_params` within the `[0,n_params)` range is either, so regardless of the infinite loop this wasn't likely terrific behavior :rofl:

I think what I failed to say since I'm new to this ecosystem is that **this is** the behavior that is triggered by encountering the aforementioned overflow. Despite the call to `pw_update_stream_params` being initiated (observed w/ debugger), the presence of null values in `params` triggers (likely undefined) downstream behavior, that I observed to be pipewire taking *no action whatsoever* in terms of actual updates in response to the call. This means we print \"Renegotiating format\", but never actually get that far, and repeatedly fail to use the DMA-BUF in our rendering API (exactly as is in the logs in the OP).\r\n\r\nI realize this is *very likely* only tangentially related if there are logic failures that cause circumstances other than this to trigger similar symptoms. I think we're all on the same page there; That said, the desktop hardware support stack(s) are a a painfully broad, and oft lonely experience to independently learn on one's own, so after spending far too long ramping up to track down what ended up being a simple lack of buffer space, I'll take whatever good discussion for learning I can get out of it, and hopefully save some poor google'ing sap some time in the process.\r\n\r\n> If a modifier don't work for a given format we drop it, but the same modifier value might work with another format\r\n\r\nThis was my assumption too based on my limited understanding, but at least for my current version of `firefox` (`100.0.1`), it's webrtc implementation of pipewire dma-buf sharing *does* remove a given modifier from *all* formats during each round of attempted negotiation. Thanks for confirming my suspicion that the OBS implementation was more correct!
