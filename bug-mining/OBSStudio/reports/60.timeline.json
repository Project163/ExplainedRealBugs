This likely would not be the case if this was a simple system misconfiguration issue. \r\n\r\nAs far as video not providing reproduction steps, I did not anticipate it being difficult for a reader to watch the first 60 seaconds of a video and read a 5 step list showing how this state was achieved. \r\n\r\n(Twitch mutes audio by default, please un-mute and listen of course, due to the nature of the bug.)\r\n\r\nIf anyone is having trouble with this, I would be more than happy to provide further clarification.\r\n\r\nI'm not _entirely_ certain whether the order of devices plugged in or the time of it appears to matter during the use session, but it appears the issue recurs regardless of these variables. It happens most often during the beginning of a use session after restarting the computer or switching settings profiles, independent of which settings profile I use. Hence why I consider this bug reproducible. \r\n\r\nIf I can catch the  issue again, I'll provide some logs. \r\n\r\nThis issue has occured _**numerous**_ times to me (including one time where I was having a private conversation on the phone giving my Social Security Number and it was picked up by the 'Desktop Audio' of the stream towards Twitch due to this bug), and I'm pretty certain it's a bug with OBS/Linux that may need some attention.

You can start `pavucontrol` on your own system and and forcibly change OBS's desktop audio from the monitor device to any recording device (including your mics) yourself.\r\n\r\nLikely some variation of this is happening and something on your system is doing a similar redirection. This is intentionally transparent in PA to allow you to redirect software that might not let you chose the right device. And as such there is nothing we can do in OBS if we choose the right device and some other software on your system redirects it, thats OBS working as intended and requires you reconfigure your system to stop doing that.\r\n\r\nIts not like I dont believe this issue is happening to you, I simply asking you to do everything you can to make sure what I describe is not the case. Since I cannot replicate this on my own LTS version of ubuntu with a basic microphone and analog audio, there is not much more I personally can do to investigate the issue with the information currently available. That's why we rely on you to provide as much detail as possible about the issue and more specifically to provide replication steps that work as consistently as possible.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/665418095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kkartaltepe","id":526419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe","html_url":"https://github.com/kkartaltepe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3702011004,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3MDIwMTEwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/events/3702011004","actor":{"login":"WizardCM","id":941350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTM1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/941350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM","html_url":"https://github.com/WizardCM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WizardCM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-28T01:40:28Z","label":{"name":"Linux","color":"709bc9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/865285399","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3211#issuecomment-865285399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3211","id":865285399,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NTI4NTM5OQ==","user":{"login":"AlexFolland","id":601517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTUxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/601517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexFolland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexFolland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-21T19:22:43Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T19:22:43Z","body":"I see this issue as well, using PipeWire 0.3.30 and PulseEffects 5.0.4.  I believe this happens with PulseEffects specifically.  I'm including context to rationalize that belief.\r\n\r\nRelevant information for reproducing the issue:\r\n\r\n- In PulseEffects, an equalizer effect is on my output and a noise reduction effect is on my input.\r\n- In PulseEffects settings \"General\" tab, \"Process All Outputs\" and \"Process All Inputs\" are enabled.\r\n- In PulseEffects settings \"PipeWire\" tab, \"Input Effects\" and \"Output Effects\" are both set to \"Use Default\"\r\n- PipeWire default sink is set to \"Built-in Audio Analog Stereo\".\r\n    - This is my motherboard's audio output with a 3.5mm jack.\r\n- PipeWire default source is set to \"Audio Adapter (Unitek Y-247A Mono)\".\r\n    - This is a small USB audio adapter I use for cleaner input.\r\n- In OBS settings, \"Desktop Audio\" is set to \"Default\".\r\n- In OBS settings, \"Mic/Auxiliary Audio\" is set to \"Default\".\r\n- In `pavucontrol` \"Recording\" tab, \"OBS Desktop Audio from\" is set to \"PulseEffects source\".\r\n    - The workaround of manually changing this from \"PulseEffects source\" to \"Monitor of Built-in Audio Analog Stereo\" fixes the issue for that particular OBS session.\r\n        - The issue comes back on any new session of OBS, so the workaround is currently necessary every time OBS starts.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems obvious to me.  My rationale is below.\r\n\r\n- In OBS settings, \"Desktop Audio\" being set to \"Default\" is using \"PulseEffects source\", which is a microphone-related input source, not a monitor of a sink (output).\r\n    - Instead, OBS \"Desktop Audio\" being set to \"Default\" should use \"Monitor of [default sink]\".
