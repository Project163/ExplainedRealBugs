install.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/2686178327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pkviet","id":9283407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9283407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet","html_url":"https://github.com/pkviet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16486723759,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAMnsBs6Z41CjzwAAAAPWr3Cv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/events/16486723759","actor":{"login":"nacalai","id":4357694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTc2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4357694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai","html_url":"https://github.com/nacalai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-26T20:57:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16486723770,"node_id":"SE_lADOAMnsBs6Z41CjzwAAAAPWr3C6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/events/16486723770","actor":{"login":"nacalai","id":4357694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTc2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4357694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai","html_url":"https://github.com/nacalai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nacalai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-26T20:57:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16660765603,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAMnsBs6Z41CjzwAAAAPhDxuj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/events/16660765603","actor":{"login":"pkviet","id":9283407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9283407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet","html_url":"https://github.com/pkviet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkviet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2e135c1d21c7a3109cfae9008d17fc6e71a365b6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkviet/obs-studio/commits/2e135c1d21c7a3109cfae9008d17fc6e71a365b6","created_at":"2025-03-10T19:55:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"pkviet","id":9283407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM

Description\r\nThe PR consists in various improvements available with latest NVIDIA Effects SDK\r\n(as of February 2025, Video FX = 0.7.6 ; Audio FX = 1.6.0):\r\n- use new NVIDIA logger function for audio and video SDK (useful for debugging purposes);\r\n- instead of destroying audio effects when the SDK returns an error, disable it. This avoids calling the destroy source function from within the filter and will avoid some crashes;\r\n- for audio effects, a new VAD (Voice Audio Data) toggle is added, which optimizes the filters processing for voice (removing low-volume noise and all non-speech data);\r\n- for Background Removal filter, SDK >= 0.7.6 introduces new methods whereby chairs can be removed or not, along with the said background.\r\nAdditionally, a fix is added when resetting background removal effect; the temporal state variable was not properly re-initialized when resetting the effect.\r\n\r\n**Edit (2/28/25):**\r\n- fix added for the third-party bug [1]; the nvidia sdk does not ensure that alpha is set to 1 for the foreground in Background removal. We bypass this by enforcing an alpha value to 1 above a given threshold in the filter. \r\nThere's an edge case however when the threshold is set to 1.0 where the bulk foreground is not set to 1, while one would expect a well defined bulk at alpha = 1.\r\nThe fix added deals with this edge case by setting a max threshold to 0.95.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/FiniteSingularity/obs-stroke-glow-shadow/issues/61\r\n\r\n**Edit (3/10/2025)**\r\n- fix added for bug #11383 where blur effect led to blank source whenever the parent source was updated.\r\n\r\n**Edit (3/12/2025)**\r\nAll the bugfixes have been split into their own PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/11952\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\nImprove the current effects by adding new options available with newer SDK.\r\nNew audio option:\r\n![obs64_2025-02-26_00-09-20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eee616df-9a1d-4432-bfd3-4d0ba35af52c)\r\n\r\nNew video options:\r\n![obs64_2025-02-26_00-10-39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9905f19b-d9b6-49a4-a68e-e5e562b99188)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe effects all work fine.
