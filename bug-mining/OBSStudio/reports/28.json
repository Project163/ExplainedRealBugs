Create and lock source in its position\r\n2. try to drag and drop where it is around the screen\r\n3. See the undo available\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nMy nightly technically is #4508 but that shouldn't matter","closed_by":{"login":"notr1ch","id":876345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/876345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch","html_url":"https://github.com/notr1ch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notr1ch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
