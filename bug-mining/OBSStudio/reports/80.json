When I go to run OBS again via the flatpak, OBS warns that it's already running. I acknowledge by clicking \"launch anyway\" and continue to launch. When I start streaming in this mode, using QSV/H.264, the stream works just fine.\r\n\r\nThe above linked log URL is of the failure. Here is a log link of the encoding working when I launch acknowledging that another OBS instance is running. https://obsproject.com/logs/MOWiWFbf0EAKLOHJ\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Set stream output to WHIP (likely not related to issue)\r\n2. Set stream encoder to QSV/H.264 (any settings)\r\n3. Start stream\r\n\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nI'm using an Intel Arc A380 - driver versions:\r\n```\r\nvainfo: VA-API version: 1.20 (libva 2.20.0)\r\nvainfo: Driver version: Intel iHD driver for Intel(R) Gen Graphics - 23.4.0 ()\r\n```\r\nI also noted this line in the log out, indicating that I'm not on an Intel GPU?\r\n```\r\napp not on intel GPU, fall back to old qsv encoder\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"RytoEX","id":624931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDkzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/624931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX","html_url":"https://github.com/RytoEX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RytoEX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
