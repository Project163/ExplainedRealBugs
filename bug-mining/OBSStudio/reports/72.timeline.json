a follow up. the crash was caused by Teleport, but not within itself. It was triggering an assert inside OBS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobs: ./libobs/util/circlebuf.h:246: circlebuf_peek_front: Assertion `size <= cb->size' failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo potentially Teleport tried to push data with 0 size? Hopefully with an updated Teleport this will not occur again.\r\n\r\nSome remaining questions for me are:\r\n- Is it intentional, that release versions of OBS do assert? No `NDEBUG` flag being set?\r\n- Is that assert behavior on all platforms the same or is this on Linux only?\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/1274328784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fzwoch","id":439605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTYwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch","html_url":"https://github.com/fzwoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fzwoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/1274825476","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7574#issuecomment-1274825476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/7574","id":1274825476,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAMnsBs5L_EsE","user":{"login":"kkartaltepe","id":526419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe","html_url":"https://github.com/kkartaltepe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkartaltepe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-11T14:50:35Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T14:50:35Z","body":"Someone else reported a possibly similar crash after 3 hours with no plugins, but i cannot replicate it.
