Operating System Info\n\nUbuntu 24.04\n\n### Other OS\n\nUbuntu MATE 24.04\n\n### OBS Studio Version\n\nGit\n\n### OBS Studio Version (Other)\n\n_No response_\n\n### OBS Studio Log URL\n\nhttps://obsproject.com/logs/A4lqRAPzSub0WVYQ\n\n### OBS Studio Crash Log URL\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expected that it'd be possible to enter text within a custom browser dock.\n\n### Current Behavior\n\nA segmentation fault occurs when I attempt to enter text into a custom browser dock;\n\n```console\n(obs:161196): Pango-CRITICAL **: 11:05:16.947: pango_layout_new: assertion 'context != NULL' failed\n\nThread 1 \"obs\" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1.  Add a custom browser dock, e.g.:\n    -   Dock Name: test\n    -   URL: https://www.duckduckgo.com.\n2.  Select 'Close'.\n3.  Attempt to type anything into the search bar in the browser dock.\n\n### Anything else we should know?\n\nNOTE: It _does_ occasionally work when I run it with a debugger attached - so this seems like, maybe, something racy?\n\nNOTE:\n-   libgtk-3 at 3.24.41\n-   libpango at 1.52.1\n\nHere's the GDB `where` output - didn't help me much.\n\n```gdb\n(gdb) where\n#0  0x00007fffe88db77c in ???
