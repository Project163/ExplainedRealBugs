GPUs due to an unfortunate interaction between Simple Output Mode, HEVC, and our default B-frames setting of 2. Since we already check the Max B-frames capability of the encoder, cap at that value instead of erroring out.\r\n\r\nFixes #7698.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?
