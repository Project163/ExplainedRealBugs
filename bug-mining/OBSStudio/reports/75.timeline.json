Please fill out the following template, which will help other contributors review your Pull Request. -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Make sure you’ve read the contribution guidelines here:

include screenshots. -->\r\nThis reverts the changes to Windows where Release() was called every time, since we need share a single DX context across multiple encoders.\r\n\r\nInstead introduce a Release2() function and some platform specific session data that will be passed to it. We use this to track the VA-API display and fd to release them at the right time. Leaking displays will also lead to cache pollution in the intel-media-driver crashing users so we cannot do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open GitHub Issue, or implements feature request -->\r\n<!--- from the Ideas page, please link to the issue here. -->\r\nfixes #9611\r\nAvoids crashes in drivers due to caching invalid buffers if we just leak these instead.\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment (hardware, OS version, etc.),-->\r\n<!--- and the tests you ran, including how it may affect other areas of code. -->\r\nStarting a streaming and recording session works fine on linux again.\r\n\r\nStarting and stopping different kinds of encoding sessions works ~~(except h265 which is broken on discrete intel GPUs due to a driver bug).~~\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your PR introduce?
