The version of Zoom that I have still works -- it finds the virtual device just fine -- but Chrome no longer finds it.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, exclusive_caps=1 tells v4loopback to start the virtual device in \"OUTPUT\" capabilities (so that programs such as Chrome won't find it), then switch to \"CAPTURE only\" capabilities once something like obs starts sending data to the virtual device.  However, when the data stream stops, the virtual device remains in \"CAPTURE only\" mode and I think this prevents OBS from either finding or re-opening the device on second and subsequent attempts.  The only reliable solution is to restart the virtual device altogether, either via a reboot or a rmmod/modprobe of the device as mentioned by others above.\r\n\r\nIdeally I think the virtual device should reset itself to advertising OUTPUT capabilities when it no longer has an active input data stream -- but that would be a fix to v4l2loopback instead of obs.   Alternatively, obs should find/open the device for streaming even if it's not currently advertising OUTPUT capabilities.\r\n\r\nHope this helps point the way to a solution.\r\n\r\nPm\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/903176450/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmichaud","id":41962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud","html_url":"https://github.com/pmichaud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/903181529","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4808#issuecomment-903181529","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4808","id":903181529,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAMnsBs411XTZ","user":{"login":"pmichaud","id":41962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud","html_url":"https://github.com/pmichaud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmichaud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-21T22:03:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-21T22:03:01Z","body":"To follow-up a bit on my previous post:  If I set up the loopback device without \"exclusive_caps=1\", then \"v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --all\" gives me the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npmichaud@kiwi:~$ sudo v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --all\r\nDriver Info:\r\n\tDriver name      : v4l2 loopback\r\n\tCard type        : Dummy video device (0x0000)\r\n\tBus info         : platform:v4l2loopback-000\r\n\tDriver version   : 5.11.22\r\n\tCapabilities     : 0x85200003\r\n\t\tVideo Capture\r\n\t\tVideo Output\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\n\t\tDevice Capabilities\r\n\tDevice Caps      : 0x05200003\r\n\t\tVideo Capture\r\n\t\tVideo Output\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\nPriority: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis part of the output remains the same no matter how many times \"Start Virtual Camera\" and \"Stop Virtual Camera\" are selected.

Step 2: Environment:\r\n\r\n  * `v4l2loopback` version: 0.12.5  (via v4l2loopback-dkms package)\r\n  * kernel version: 5.11.0-31-generic\r\n  * Distribution (+version): Ubuntu 21.04\r\n\r\n### Step 3: Describe the problem:\r\n\r\nWhen using exclusive_caps=1, the loopback device can only be opened once by a producer.  If the producer closes the device, it's no longer available to be opened by a subsequent producer.\r\n\r\nThis is being observed by multiple people in e.g. https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4808 ... once a Virtual Camera is started and stopped, it's not possible to re-start a virtual camera without removing and reloading the v4l2loopback device.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1. Load v4l2loopback with exclusive_caps=1\r\n  2. Run OBS studio.  Select \"Start Virtual Camera\" (works)\r\n  3. Select \"Stop Virtual Camera\" (works)\r\n  4. Select \"Start Virtual Camera\" (fails with error message \"Failed to start virtual camera\")\r\n\r\nExiting OBS and removing/reloading the v4l2loopback module (via rmmod and modprobe) re-enables the virtual camera setting for another single instance.\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\n  * When exclusive_caps=1 is not used, OBS can start/stop/restart the virtual camera without limitation.\r\n  * When exclusive_caps=1 is used, OBS can do one invocation of \"Start Virtual Camera\".  Subsequent invocations fail until the v4l2loopback module is reloaded.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, here's the output of v4l2-ctl for a loopback device created without \"exclusive_caps=1\":\r\n\r\n```\r\npmichaud@kiwi:~$ sudo v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --all\r\nDriver Info:\r\n\tDriver name      : v4l2 loopback\r\n\tCard type        : Dummy video device (0x0000)\r\n\tBus info         : platform:v4l2loopback-000\r\n\tDriver version   : 5.11.22\r\n\tCapabilities     : 0x85200003\r\n\t\tVideo Capture\r\n\t\tVideo Output\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\n\t\tDevice Capabilities\r\n\tDevice Caps      : 0x05200003\r\n\t\tVideo Capture\r\n\t\tVideo Output\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\nPriority: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis remains the same before, during, and after Virtual Camera output in OBS.  As a result, OBS is able to start/stop/re-start the virtual camera an unlimited number of times.  However, Chrome will not find the device as a valid video input (thus the reason for wanting exclusive_caps=1).\r\n\r\nWith exclusive_caps=1, the device starts out with:\r\n\r\n```\r\npmichaud@kiwi:~$ sudo v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --all\r\nDriver Info:\r\n\tDriver name      : v4l2 loopback\r\n\tCard type        : Dummy video device (0x0000)\r\n\tBus info         : platform:v4l2loopback-000\r\n\tDriver version   : 5.11.22\r\n\tCapabilities     : 0x85200002\r\n\t\tVideo Output\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\n\t\tDevice Capabilities\r\n\tDevice Caps      : 0x05200002\r\n\t\tVideo Output\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\nPriority: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce \"Start Virtual Camera\" is used in OBS, the device switches to:\r\n\r\n```\r\npmichaud@kiwi:~$ sudo v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --all\r\nDriver Info:\r\n\tDriver name      : v4l2 loopback\r\n\tCard type        : Dummy video device (0x0000)\r\n\tBus info         : platform:v4l2loopback-000\r\n\tDriver version   : 5.11.22\r\n\tCapabilities     : 0x85200001\r\n\t\tVideo Capture\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\n\t\tDevice Capabilities\r\n\tDevice Caps      : 0x05200001\r\n\t\tVideo Capture\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\nPriority: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point consumers such as Chrome can see the device and receive the video stream.\r\n\r\nWhen \"Stop Virtual Camera\" is selected in OBS, the device switches to:\r\n\r\n```\r\npmichaud@kiwi:~$ sudo v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 --all\r\nDriver Info:\r\n\tDriver name      : v4l2 loopback\r\n\tCard type        : Dummy video device (0x0000)\r\n\tBus info         : platform:v4l2loopback-000\r\n\tDriver version   : 5.11.22\r\n\tCapabilities     : 0x85200000\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\n\t\tDevice Capabilities\r\n\tDevice Caps      : 0x05200000\r\n\t\tRead/Write\r\n\t\tStreaming\r\n\t\tExtended Pix Format\r\nPriority: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point the device is no longer available to be used by OBS or other producers for output (advertises neither OUTPUT nor CAPTURE capabilities).  Subsequent attempts to \"Start Virtual Camera\" in OBS fail.  The only mechanism found so far is to reboot or \"rmmod v4l2loopback / modprobe v4l2loopback\" to restart another loopback device.\r\n \r\n#### Expected Results:\r\n\r\n  * When exclusive_caps=1 is present, a producer should be able to open and use the virtual loopback device even if it has been previously used/closed by a previous producer.\r\n  * Alternatively, there should be some way to reset the virtual loopback device to an OUTPUT state if there are no other producers currently writing to the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/v4l2loopback/v4l2loopback/issues/442/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/v4l2loopback/v4l2loopback/issues/442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/comments/917018386","html_url":"https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4808#issuecomment-917018386","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4808","id":917018386,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAMnsBs42qJcS","user":{"login":"WebrangerC","id":48608024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjA4MDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48608024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC","html_url":"https://github.com/WebrangerC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WebrangerC/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-10T16:00:47Z","updated_at":"2021-09-10T16:00:47Z","body":"@pmichaud THANK YOU. \r\nI haven't duplicated/verified the exclusive_caps BUT using modprobe to re-initialize: \r\n  - sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback\r\n  - sudo modprobe v4l2loopback\r\nworks well for Zoom, even if Zoom has been started and I wanted to switch to using OBS.
