Install OBS with the 26.1.1 version\r\n2. Run OBS the first time with a connected 4k display\r\n3. choose \"optimized for recording\r\n4. you'll see the 4k display is only shown with a resolution of 2k (2560x1440)\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\nI've tried this on three different computers and it was always the same issue.\r\nThe I've tried it with the older version of OBS (26.0.2) and everything works perfectly fine. The 4k display is shown as a 4k display.","closed_by":{"login":"jp9000","id":2084112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2084112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000","html_url":"https://github.com/jp9000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jp9000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
