It doesn't really matter what values I enter, there are always numbers similar to those listed (numbers in distant decimal positions and Z value change).\r\n\r\nFor example, my code:\r\n\r\nCRSFactory crsFactory = new CRSFactory();\r\nCoordinateReferenceSystem t1 = crsFactory.createFromName(\"epsg:4326\");\r\nCoordinateReferenceSystem t2 = crsFactory.createFromName(\"epsg:5514\");\r\nCoordinateTransformFactory ctFactory = new CoordinateTransformFactory();\r\nCoordinateTransform tran = ctFactory.createTransform(t2, t1);\r\nProjCoordinate result_p2 = new ProjCoordinate();\r\nProjCoordinate vstup=new ProjCoordinate( -743093.7321490766, -1044381.7725184687);\r\ntran.transform(vstup, result_p2);\r\n\r\nThis code is supposed to return 14.42, 50.075, but it does return 24.82998756399294 -59.94829824087518. Similar result numbers are for any input. Obviously there will be an error somewhere in the transformation equation. It works in one direction, not inversely.","closed_by":{"login":"pomadchin","id":4929546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mjk1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4929546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin","html_url":"https://github.com/pomadchin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pomadchin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/proj4j/issues/80/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/proj4j/issues/80/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
