It seems to fix click failing when both `LANG` and `LC_CTYPES` are unset, with no obvious drawbacks.\n\nI haven't added any tests (yet) because I'd like to know if this patch is acceptable, or if, in my ignorance, I've overlooked something that makes this useless.

there.  I am running a click-based python command line utility over an SSH connection using paramiko, and I see this error:\n\n```\n  File \"/Users/broxton/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 716, in __call__\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/Users/broxton/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 675, in main\n    _verify_python3_env()\n  File \"/Users/broxton/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/_unicodefun.py\", line 69, in _verify_python3_env\n    print(locale.lower().endswith(('utf-8', '.utf8')))\nTypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'\n```\n\nThis is on a machine running Mac OS 10.11 and Anaconda Python 3.5.\n\nIt appears that `click` is calling `locale -a` through a sub-process, and the result is being returned as a byte string rather than a Python string.  The call to `.endswith()` fails because Python refuses to compare a bytes-like object to the strings in the tuple: `('utf-8', '.utf8')`  This error does not occur when I run the command through my local shell, rather than remotely over the ssh connection.  \n\nCoercing the locale string returned by `subprocess()` allows click to proceed further to the more informative error message:\n\n```\nRuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment.  Either run this under Python 2 or consult http://click.pocoo.org/python3/ for mitigation steps.\n```\n\nThe first error seems to mask the second, so I would recommend adding a tiny bit of type coercion here from a byte to a string type here so that this code works in either case and the user can then encounter the helpful `RuntimeErrror` message that leads them to correct their locale issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":571262481,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU3MTI2MjQ4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/571262481","actor":{"login":"bameda","id":877218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/877218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda","html_url":"https://github.com/bameda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bameda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e44bcbf79f96a8f4f4d93617adb8ae6823493614","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bameda/icarus-twitter-bot/commits/e44bcbf79f96a8f4f4d93617adb8ae6823493614","created_at":"2016-02-29T15:20:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"boxed","id":332428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjQyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed","html_url":"https://github.com/boxed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-07T04:38:09Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T04:38:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boxed/mutmut/issues/80","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boxed/mutmut","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boxed/mutmut/issues/80/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boxed/mutmut/issues/80/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boxed/mutmut/issues/80/events","html_url":"https://github.com/boxed/mutmut/issues/80","id":407440845,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDc0NDA4NDU=","number":80,"title":"Can't
