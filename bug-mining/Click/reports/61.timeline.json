good reason to allow this, at least for my use case, is that you can update the \"current item\" while you are waiting for work to be done, like a heartbeat.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` python\nwith click.progressbar(length=5, item_show_func=lambda x: current_time()) as progress_bar:\n    wait_some_time()\n    work_done = check_remote_resource_for_progress()\n    progress_bar.update(work_done)\n```\n\nSo even if no work was done on a given iteration, you can still update the progress bar with something like the current time to indicate that things are still working.\n\nIf I understand correctly, `show_eta` doesn't kick in until [after the first step has been made](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/click/blob/89d3bfda52d151762e732738b828312a240bf89e/click/_termui_impl.py#L231), and it probably is unreliable for this situation where you are waiting on remote resources to do work.\n\nAn alternative solution for this \"heartbeat\" use case may be to add an option similar to `show_eta` which shows a timer that simply counts up.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/152704119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-01T02:55:39Z","updated_at":"2015-11-01T02:55:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nchammas/flintrock/issues/27","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nchammas/flintrock","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nchammas/flintrock/issues/27/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nchammas/flintrock/issues/27/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nchammas/flintrock/issues/27/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/flintrock/issues/27","id":112644220,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTI2NDQyMjA=","number":27,"title":"Implement

output is already much cleaner compared to spark-ec2's:\n\n```\nLaunching 2 instances...\n[52.91.67.xxx] SSH online.\n[52.91.67.xxx] Installing Spark...\n[52.91.213.xxx] SSH online.\n[52.91.213.xxx] Installing Spark...\nAll 2 instances provisioned.\n[52.91.67.xxx] Configuring Spark master...\nSpark Health Report:\n  * Master: ALIVE\n  * Workers: 1\n  * Cores: 1\n  * Memory: 2.7 GB            \nlaunch_ec2 finished in 0:02:52.\n```\n\nBut this still needs some improvement. If you were to launch a 100-node cluster, you would get more than 200 lines of output: 100 lines showing when SSH comes online, and 100 lines for installing Spark.\n\nThis is noise.\n\nA better user experience would be to show some kind of progress bar for each \"stage\" of the operation that Flintrock is executing.\n\nSo for cluster launches, we would show a single progress bar that advances as SSH becomes available across the nodes of the cluster, and another progress bar that advances as Spark is installed across the nodes of the cluster.\n\nMaybe something like this:\n\n```\nSSH online       [####################..........]  75%\nSpark installed  [######........................]  25%\n```\n\nI'll look into [Click's progress bar utility](http://click.pocoo.org/5/api/#click.progressbar), though it looks like I will probably have to find a workaround for [this issue](http://stackoverflow.com/q/32080382/877069) with having multiple progress bars being updated simultaneously.\n\nOther considerations to keep in mind:\n- [ ] This must work well when Flintrock's output is redirected to a file.\n- [ ] We need some affordance that lets people see what node, if any, is hanging up an operation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nchammas/flintrock/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nchammas/flintrock/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1627846508,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2Mjc4NDY1MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/1627846508","actor":{"login":"fdavis","id":2244065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis","html_url":"https://github.com/fdavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-15T18:00:05Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1627846513,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2Mjc4NDY1MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/1627846513","actor":{"login":"fdavis","id":2244065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis","html_url":"https://github.com/fdavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-15T18:00:05Z","label":{"name":"good
