This means that completions ['1', '2', '10'] would be displayed out of natural sort order as ['1', '10', '2']. Update the completion script to bring the sorting into Python where custom types can be sorted more appropriately. Note that the version of bash that ships with OS X is v3.2. The nosort option for `complete` was introduced in v4.4 This change should support both.","closed_by":{"login":"davidism","id":1242887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism","html_url":"https://github.com/davidism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/1047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/1047/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
