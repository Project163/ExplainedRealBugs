Your file appears to be empty because the temporary file really is, at the end of your CLI app the original file is replaced.\n\nBecause atomic file writes work the way they do, you can't \"just modify a file in-place\" without copying the whole file to a temporary location. But I think if click started doing that implictly for the `+`-modes, I think we'd hide the performance penalties that come with copying the whole file. Furthermore none of this would be really atomic anymore. I strongly suspect that you're using the `atomic=True` option in a case where it can't be even applied.\n\nThere is some usability bug in click. I'm not sure how to solve it. Perhaps we should disallow any other mode than `w` if `atomic=True` is used.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/110634728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"untitaker","id":837573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker","html_url":"https://github.com/untitaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":327127034,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyNzEyNzAzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/327127034","actor":{"login":"untitaker","id":837573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker","html_url":"https://github.com/untitaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-10T07:35:50Z","label":{"name":"stupid behavior","color":"eb6420"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/110802208","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/357#issuecomment-110802208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/357","id":110802208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDgwMjIwOA==","user":{"login":"mdklatt","id":2087508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODc1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2087508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt","html_url":"https://github.com/mdklatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdklatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-10T15:39:24Z","updated_at":"2015-06-10T15:39:24Z","body":"I've had to roll my own atomic file before, and I resolved this issue by not bothering to create/copy the temporary file if the mode was read-only.
