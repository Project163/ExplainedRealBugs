I pass in something like `work_remaining_start - work_remaining_end` to `progress_bar.update()` in a loop that periodically checks these remote resources, and sometimes this difference is 0.\n\nDoes it make sense for `update()` to accept a step of 0?\n","closed_by":{"login":"davidism","id":1242887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism","html_url":"https://github.com/davidism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
