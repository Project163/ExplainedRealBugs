Without tracing this out thoroughly, it seems like this is the key difference.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOpinion Zone:\r\nThe real thing that's wrong here is that `Argument` has a non-empty `opts` value. I've seen this elsewhere in the code and it seems wrong -- the name doesn't help either, as it implies that it's a good detector of Option vs. Argument.\r\nFixing that would be a breaking change as completion and other advanced usage may depend upon this value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of ways of fixing this.\r\nProbably the least invasive is to make `MissingParameter` formatting read `param.get_usage_pieces` and see if there's anything there. However, there's so much layering going on here, I don't really want to act without some kind of input from the maintainers.\r\nPlus, although pragmatic, that fix is icky and may be abusing the meaning of `get_usage_pieces`.\r\n\r\nSomething that is common throughout is that a lot of the code handles Options and Argument equivalently. I'm not sure how much people are defining their own param types, and adding an attribute \"option-style\" vs. \"argument-style\" would probably resolve a lot of this confusion.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/269831527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sirosen","id":1300022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1300022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen","html_url":"https://github.com/sirosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/269831925","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/704#issuecomment-269831925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/704","id":269831925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2OTgzMTkyNQ==","user":{"login":"sirosen","id":1300022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1300022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen","html_url":"https://github.com/sirosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-30T22:52:57Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T22:52:57Z","body":"Oh,
