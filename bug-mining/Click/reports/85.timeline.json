Summary\r\n\r\nSince release `v8.3.0`, the `Sentinel.UNSET` enum value has been bleeding to users of click where options have no default and the value is not required.\r\n\r\nThis commit contains a

order to ensure that user-defined `type_cast_value` hooks are never\ncalled with a value of `UNSET`, it is necessary to intercept `UNSET`\nvalues and, in the particular cases in which `UNSET` needs special\nhandling, preempt any call to `type_cast_value()`.\n\n`process_value()` is updated to check before calling `type_cast_value`\nand to skip the call entirely if an `UNSET` value is detected. Passing\na value of `None` would not have the same effect for `click.Option`,\nwhich previously had logic which is specific to the `value is UNSET`\ncase, and which cannot be reliably detected if a `None` value is\npassed in.\n\nThis means that `type_cast_value()` is no longer guaranteed to be called\nduring argument processing, but when it is called, it's guaranteed not to\nsee an `UNSET` value. New tests explore this only from the perspective of\nchecking if `UNSET` is ever passed, not in terms of pinning down when/if\nthe hook gets called.\n\nresolves #3069\n\n-----\n\nI think this change is worth considering as a fix for #3069, but I'm not\ncertain that it's good because it seems to trade one kind of incompatibility,\nwhether or not `UNSET` gets passed, for a different one: whether or not\n`type_cast_value()` gets called at all.\n\nIf `type_cast_value()` is supposed to never see an `UNSET` value, and\n`process_value` is \"holding an `UNSET` value, then you might think that all\nwe need is\n\n```python\ntype_cast_value(..., value if value is not UNSET else None)\n```\n\nbut `Option.type_cast_value` throws a wrench in that, since it needs to\nsee the `UNSET` sentinel to properly determine its behavior.\n\nI chose to take the same approach for handling vis-a-vis `multiple` and\n`nargs=-1` in `Parameter`, on the grounds that it seemed \"better aligned\" with\nwhat has to happen in `Option`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/3090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/3090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20012960282,"node_id":"REFE_lADOASN_zM7Ms39SzwAAAASo3Yoa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/20012960282","actor":{"login":"constantinchristmann","id":62425498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDI1NDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62425498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann","html_url":"https://github.com/constantinchristmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constantinchristmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"82f8dbeb60b54cb5c666b037f67098e740052ea7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-autoapiframework/application-framework/commits/82f8dbeb60b54cb5c666b037f67098e740052ea7","created_at":"2025-09-30T15:04:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"simonw","id":9599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw","html_url":"https://github.com/simonw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-01T20:44:05Z","updated_at":"2025-10-01T20:44:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/665","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/sqlite-utils","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/665/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/665/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/665/events","html_url":"https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/pull/665","id":3475042276,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCGYnMM6roui_","number":665,"title":"Drop
