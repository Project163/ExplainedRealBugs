for not checking back on this sooner. I forgot about it. :sweat_smile:\n\n@untitaker I think there are legitimate use-cases for being case insensitive some places, but not others. That rules out changing the tokenizer as an option.\nMy particular need pertains to a CLI which wraps a REST API I'm working with.\nAs much as possible I want to be case-insensitive, but rarely I need to consume strings destined for the backend API.\n\nBeing able to patch over the tokenizer used for a given option would be perfect, and be a bit more flexible than case-insensitivity specifically for Choice types.\nIt also sounds harder to implement though.\n\nI think a good number of people probably have `type=str.lower` in their Argparse structure, but require case-sensitivity elsewhere.\nI don't like that transitioning those options required implementing my own `ParamType`.\n\nI guess this depends a bit on how important feature parity with Argparse is. I don't think that custom types count for that -- that's an extension point of Click, not \"out of the box\"

its validation logic runs before the command gets a value. In many other cases, `.lower()` can be called after types have done their work with no ill effect.\r\n\r\nAdds a test that validates both the new and the old behavior WRT case sensitivity.
