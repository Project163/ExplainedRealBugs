is a proposal to fix #2832, which points to a subtle change in behavior of the help option introduced in 8.1.8.\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem is that by deduplicating code in 8.1.8 (see: #2563), I introduced a `HelpOption` class, to centralize the setup necessary to make a standard `Option` behave like an help option.\r\n\r\nIn #2832, a user is relying on a custom class to feed the `@help_option` decorator. This bypass all the custom setup made by `HelpOption`, and produce the discrepancy in behavior between 8.1.7 and 8.1.8.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Reverts back to setting up all parameters of the help option in the decorator instead of the `HelpOption` class\r\n- Aligns `@help_option` implementation with the way Click is doing for the others (like `@password_option`, `@version_option`, ...) \r\n- Removes the `click.decorators.HelpOption` class as a consequence\r\n- Adds a complete unit test to check combination of custom class and option names leads to expected results\r\n\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n- [x] Add tests that demonstrate the correct behavior of the change. Tests should fail without the change.\r\n- [x] Add or update relevant docs, in the docs folder and in code.\r\n- [x] Add an entry in `CHANGES.rst` summarizing the change and linking to the issue.\r\n- [x] Add `.. versionchanged::` entries in any relevant code docs.\r\n- [x] Run `pre-commit` hooks and fix any issues.\r\n- [x] Run `pytest` and `tox`, no tests failed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/2840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/2840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/2581155423","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/2832#issuecomment-2581155423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/2832","id":2581155423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOASN_zM6Z2U5f","user":{"login":"kdeldycke","id":159718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTcxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke","html_url":"https://github.com/kdeldycke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kdeldycke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-09T20:06:38Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T20:06:38Z","body":"The root of the problem is that by deduplicating the code generating the help option in 8.1.8, I introduced a `HelpOption` class.
