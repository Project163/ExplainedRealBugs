the Managing Resources section of Advanced Patterns, there is [a code example](https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/f8857cb03268b5b952b88b2acb3e11d9f0f7b6e4/docs/advanced.rst?plain=1#L437-L447) where a `Repo` class is used as a context manager to be passed to `Context.with_resource`. \r\n```python\r\n    class Repo:\r\n        def __init__(self, home=None):\r\n            self.home = os.path.abspath(home or \".\")\r\n            self.db = None\r\n\r\n        def __enter__(self):\r\n            path = os.path.join(self.home, \"repo.db\")\r\n            self.db = open_database(path)\r\n\r\n        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, tb):\r\n            self.db.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `__enter__` method on `Repo` currently returns `None`, which means that the [code snippet below](https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/f8857cb03268b5b952b88b2acb3e11d9f0f7b6e4/docs/advanced.rst?plain=1#L453-L454) is broken since `repo` is `None` (the result of `__enter__()`).\r\n```python\r\n    with Repo() as repo:\r\n        repo.db.query(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the [snippet below that](https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/f8857cb03268b5b952b88b2acb3e11d9f0f7b6e4/docs/advanced.rst?plain=1#L469), we are also assigning `None` to `ctx.obj`, since `ctx.with_resource` returns the result of calling the resource’s `__enter__()` method.\r\n```python\r\n    @click.group()\r\n    @click.option(\"--repo-home\", default=\".repo\")\r\n    @click.pass_context\r\n    def cli(ctx, repo_home):\r\n        ctx.obj = ctx.with_resource(Repo(repo_home))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix is to have `Repo.__enter__` return `self`.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Click version:
