been converting a sprawling argparse CLI over to Click (and enjoying the improvements, btw), and I've run into a bit of an incompatibility between the two that I think should be easy for click to solve.\nIn short, this is a feature request for a case insensitive variant of `click.Choice`, or a general solution that handles that use case well.\n\nI had case insensitive choice options like this before:\n\n``` python\nparser.add_argument('--foo', type=str.lower, choices=('apple', 'orange'))\n```\n\nWhich means we could do commands like\n\n``` shell\n$ mycmd --foo ORANGE\n...\n$ mycmd --foo apple\n```\n\nAs far as I can tell, `click.Choices` doesn't support case insensitivity on the strings you use to choose.\n\nThis is easily implemented with a small custom type:\n\n``` python\nclass CaseInsensitiveChoice(click.Choice):\n    def convert(self, value, param, ctx):\n        if value is None:\n            return None\n        return super(CaseInsensitiveChoice, self).convert(\n            value.lower(), param, ctx)\n```\n\nHowever, I was a bit surprised that this was necessary -- I would expect Click to handle this with a keyword argument of some kind, off the shelf.\n\nThis could be a special case for doing string preprocessing, but it's maybe more justifiable as a feature on `ParamType`, something like `argument_preprocessor=func`, which would allow all `ParamType`s to hook in some kind of user-supplied function.\n\nI'm thinking of a final result something like `click.Choice(('apple', 'orange'), argument_preprocessor=str.lower)` for my own use case, but also supporting other potentially interesting things.\n","closed_by":{"login":"zacbir","id":2717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir","html_url":"https://github.com/zacbir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zacbir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/569/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
