behavior is expected given #2788.

Instead, the flag takes on the default value if it is not passed, and takes on the negation of the default value if it is passed.

While there is a an option to explicitly disable the dry run with `--no-dry-run` there is no way to do that (anymore) with the `envvar=\"DRY_RUN\"`.\n\nThe behaviour is inconsistent and a breaking change.\n\nI actually think that there is no value in `--no-dry-run`, nobody would ever use it. Only `--dry-run`. So relying on the presence of the flag seems to be fine for me. As for the `envvar`, it’s much more intuitive to use `true/false` as values rather than relying on the presence of the variable to indicate true and its absence to indicate false, which is less explicit and can easily lead to confusion or mistakes.\n\nIf this isn’t going to be reverted to the previous behavior, it would be helpful to have it clarified and officially documented, so we can confidently adjust our code without worrying about future changes.\n\nThanks for looking into this and all your work on this amazing

I noticed the issue was introduced in click 8.2.0. That's when I made the comment in the other issue.\n\n```py\n# hi.py\nimport click\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option(\"--dry-run/--no-dry-run\", default=False, envvar=\"DRY_RUN\")\ndef main(dry_run:
