It seems that switching the standard streams to binary mode reveals the underlying limit of the Windows console of limiting a single write to 64K (I think this limit was lifted in Windows 8). This affects `print`, `sys.stdout.write` and `click.echo`.\r\n\r\nIt seems that many libraries and Python itself limit a single write to 32767 bytes to workaround this. Python 3 for example: [Python/fileutils.c:1244-1250](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f7eae0adfcd4c50034281b2c69f461b43b68db84/Python/fileutils.c#L1244-L1250). It doesn't seem like Python 2 has this hack though.\r\n\r\nWe will have to either:\r\n1. Don't set the streams to binary and read/write to dupped stream fds (and file objects) that are set to binary.\r\n2. Wrap the standard streams and workaround this.\r\n3. Submit a patch to Python 2 which I'm not sure will ever be accepted.\r\n4.
