click is a py2/py3 compatible project, we should consider using [`six.Iterator`](https://pythonhosted.org/six/#six.Iterator) to make it easier to ensure that both the py2 and py3 interfaces are satisfied.\r\n\r\nThis also seems pretty easy to add a test for, based on the example given.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/426023646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sirosen","id":1300022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1300022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen","html_url":"https://github.com/sirosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/426025954","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/1125#issuecomment-426025954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/1125","id":426025954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjAyNTk1NA==","user":{"login":"davidism","id":1242887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism","html_url":"https://github.com/davidism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T19:06:45Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T19:07:38Z","body":"Due

add a test for iterating on a progressbar with next()\r\n- implement `next()` in terms of `iter(ProgressBar)`, which is already well-defined\r\n- add a note about slow operations with progressbar to narrative docs\r\n\r\nOne of the keys to this working is that `ProgressBar.generator` is consuming an iterable and doesn't store any important state in local variables, making it re-entry safe.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure how we can best hint in the public docs that simply walking the bar and stopping one step short of finishing will result in the progress bar \"hanging\" unfinished. Noting that we work well with things like `time.sleep()` seems like a decent way of advertising positively something which we support *and* guiding anyone going off-book into proper usage.\r\n\r\ncloses
