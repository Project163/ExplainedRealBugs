an initial stab at #651, which I'm submitting for discussion.\r\nBy using a generator instead of an iterator, doing post-iteration work (progress bar update) becomes trivial. With an iterator, not so much, at least no obvious way that I could think of. \r\n\r\nDelaying the status update to _after_ the iteration also fixed the ETA.\r\nE.g. the following won't show a proper ETA using 0.6.6 nor master\r\n```python\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\nfrom click import progressbar\r\n\r\nwith progressbar(range(10)) as bar:\r\n    for _ in bar:\r\n        sleep(1)\r\n```\r\n    =[output]==>\r\n    before first  iteration: [###---------------------------------]   10%\r\n    before second iteration: [#######-----------------------------]   20%  00:00:04\r\n\r\nUsing a generator to update the progress _after_ the iteration rounds fixes the ETA, and the progress starts at 0% _until_ the first iteration is done, as was requested in the ticket. Only when the last item has been iterated over, and processed by the user's block of code, will the statusbar show 100%.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith progressbar(range(10)) as bar:\r\n    for _ in bar:\r\n        sleep(1)\r\n```\r\n    =[output]==>\r\n    before first iteration  [------------------------------------]    0%\r\n    before second iteration [###---------------------------------]   10%  00:00:09\r\n\r\nAny style or design notions that are broken in this draft change?\r\n-----\r\n[commit message]\r\nUpdate progress after iteration (fix #651)\r\n\r\nReported \"off by one\" error is due to the fact that an interator is used\r\ninstead of a generator. As such there is no way for the bar to know when\r\nit has iterated over the user's code block.\r\n\r\nThis commit swaps the iterator for a generator, and changes _when_ the\r\nstatus report is updated, from before each iteration of a user's code\r\nblock, to _after_.\r\n\r\nUpdating the status report after the user's code has run allows the\r\nreport to convey how much work has been _done_ so far.\r\n\r\nAccidental gain:\r\nThe associated unit test performs a black-box test on the generated\r\nprogress output. This test revealed a bug in the ETA time calculation\r\nwere the behavior differed between python 2 and 3, causing the unit test\r\nto fail on python 3. The remedy employed to allow passing of the test is\r\nto use integer division for the ETA calculation, which should also\r\naddress a related issue (fixes
