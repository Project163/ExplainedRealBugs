currently click strips colors when used in code invoked by ipython notebooks\r\n\r\nafter a short chat on the ipython notebook channel i learned that a commonly suggested workaround is \r\n\r\n`click.utils.should_strip_ansi = lambda *k, **kw: False` and that a reasonably reliable way to detect such a stream is `stream.__class__.__module__.startswith('ipykernel.')`\r\n\r\ni propose setting up isatty to check this in the exception case (aka no tty attribute as the jupyter streams dont have one\r\n\r\nadditional help will be needed from someone with a windows system, as to me it is not clear whether its required to alter the stream wrapping that is used on win32\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"davidism","id":1242887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism","html_url":"https://github.com/davidism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/1185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/1185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
