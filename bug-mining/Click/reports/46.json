It would be great if it would show the progress in terms of results, not as an iterator.\n\nI looked briefly at the implementation in [_termui_impl.py](https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/master/click/_termui_impl.py), but the rendering seems to be closely linked to the `pos` attribute and I don't feel comfortable to mess with that. 😒\n","closed_by":{"login":"dsully","id":22371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully","html_url":"https://github.com/dsully","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsully/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/651/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
