is an enhancement to support autocompletion of arguments, as discussed in issue #241. \n\nWith this version of click, it is possible to add optional autocomplete suggestions to an argument. This is done by passing a list of str's via the `autocompletion` parameter in the argument decorator:\n\n``` python\n@cli.command()\n@click.argument(\"name\", type=click.STRING, autocompletion=[\"John\", \"Simon\", \"Doe\"])\ndef cmd1(name):\n    click.echo('Name: %s' % name)\n```\n\nI have added example code and altered the documentation to include the new feature.\n\nNotes:\n- All chosen variable names are of course open for discussion\n- I have implemented it to the best knowledge and understanding of how click is built up. If you have any suggestions on how to implement this nicer, I am happy to hear them.\n- I have tried to use this with a function that dynamically creates the suggestions. That worked very good, but I also wanted different behaviour depending on whether the script is run directly or through bash completion. This is the best I have come up with. Any thoughts?:\n\n``` python\ndef  is_bashcompletion():\n    \"\"\" Ugly test to test for bash completion mode\"\"\"\n    try:\n        os.environ['COMP_WORDS']\n        return True\n    except KeyError:\n        return False\n```\n- Unfortunately, I don't have much experience with unittests. Therefor I have not yet included any. Maybe someone could post some ideas of which scenarios to test for?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ericfrederich","id":1167238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcyMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1167238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich","html_url":"https://github.com/ericfrederich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericfrederich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-26T21:09:41Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T21:09:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/643","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/643/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/643/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/643/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/click/pull/643","id":173544215,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0ODI5NTQ2MDA=","number":643,"title":"add

say this is related to #241 ...\r\n\r\nRecently support was added to have argument autocompletion, custom completion functions/lists and a special case for click.Choice options too.\r\n\r\nThis is great ! I would like to see better support for filenames and directories, have been looking at the code and wanted to share my thoughts here... as far as I can see the problems with filename/directory are multiple but hopefully addressed with a couple of simple patches.\r\n\r\n### Undesirable Autocompletion of paths\r\n\r\nIn the case that the user is completing an option which takes one or more arguments, and those arguments cannot be completed (i.e. they are just a string or integer type), then the builtin completion mechanism correctly reports no results, however the bash completion glue ([here](https://github.com/pallets/click/blob/master/click/_bashcomplete.py#L22)) specifies *\"-o default\"*\r\n\r\nThis parameter to the bash *complete* function tells bash to default to completing paths when the resulting COMPREPLY array is empty, and the side effect is undesirable filenames being completed.\r\n\r\n### Filenames reported for directory arguments\r\n\r\nBecause click does not do anything for filenames or directories itself, it instead falls back on the undesirable *complete -o default* behavior mentioned above for filenames and all arguments which did not supply any custom autocompletion list or function.\r\n\r\nThis means that filenames are suggested when the argument is in fact a directory, and also directory names are suggested for filenames.\r\n\r\n### Filename and directory completion has different behavior\r\n\r\nThe default shell behavior is to take the reported list in COMPREPLY, and if there is only one element, it will append a space and the next TAB is ready to complete the next token, but this is not the desired behavior when completing paths, where you want to complete only one directory at a time.\r\n\r\nThis can be addressed however by using the *\"complete -o nospace ...\"* option, which will just cause the shell to not append any space for a single available completion, allowing the program to continue completing the last completion on the next iteration.\r\n\r\nIn this case, click can:\r\n* Append a space to the reported completion in the case that only one completion was available\r\n* Append a slash (if none is already there), in the case that the completion is a directory name\r\n\r\n### Proposed Approach\r\n\r\nInstead of handling click.Choice explicitly in _bashcompletion.py, we should instead have the base ParamType cooperate in the process of completion, so that paths and filenames can have an opportunity to decide if the parameter is entirely complete or could be completed further (i.e. whether a space should be appended to the reported completion, or whether it should remain, as in the case for a filename which is a directory that could be completed further).\r\n\r\nclick.Choice would implement completions by overriding an abstract method of click.ParamType, click.BOOL could also implement this, because why not.\r\n\r\nThe new *autocompletion* attribute would be checked before ever consulting the click.ParamType abstract method, so the user can always override the default completions for any parameter.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should change the completion script to not use *\"-o default\"* and use *\"-o nospace\"* instead, ensuring that filenames dont show up by default.\r\n\r\nFinally, the click.Path and click.File need to do the work we were previously offloading to the shell, this is the most tricky (or *\"meaty\"*) part of the patch I guess, hopefully a python implementation using *os.listdir()* and file concatenation would not slow down the completion process too much.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/780/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/780/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/389177818","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/241#issuecomment-389177818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/241","id":389177818,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTE3NzgxOA==","user":{"login":"jcrotts","id":29685007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Njg1MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29685007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts","html_url":"https://github.com/jcrotts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcrotts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-15T14:01:26Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T14:01:26Z","body":"#755
