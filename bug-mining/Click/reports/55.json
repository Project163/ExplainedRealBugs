say I pre-define an `option` meant for multiple commands:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nopt = click.option('opt', cls=CustomOption)\r\n\r\n@opt\r\ndef cmd1(opt):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n\r\n@opt\r\ndef cmd2(opt):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will (click 6.7, and latest master when this issue was created) cause the `cls` parameter to be popped from `**attrs` – which is shared between all calls of the inner `decorator`, because of the closure – in the first call, leading to a broken option in the second call.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's possible to work around this by instead defining a function that returns the option, but it would be nice to just fix the decorators by copying `attrs` before popping `cls`.","closed_by":{"login":"fdavis","id":2244065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDQwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2244065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis","html_url":"https://github.com/fdavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fdavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/926/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
