E.g. a simple application with subcommands. Some options are global.\n\n``` python\n@click.group()\n@click.option('--startdir', default=None)\n@click.pass_context\ndef cli(ctx, startdir):\n    ctx.obj = {'STARTDIR': startdir}\n\n@cli.command()\n@cli.pass_context\ndef sync(ctx):\n    click.echo(ctx.obj['STARTDIR'])\n```\n\nWhen I pass `sync` to `CliRunner.invoke`, the whole group will not be executed, so context will not be initialized. When I pass `cli` to `CliRunner.invoke`, I can't specify which subcommand I want to test. The documentation lacks information about that.\n","closed_by":{"login":"untitaker","id":837573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker","html_url":"https://github.com/untitaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
