262bdf0 ensured to raise an `EOFError` exception on end of input to simulate tty behavior and avoid blocking prompt during tests when no more input is available.\r\n\r\nHowever the introduced implementation has a side effect when testing a click command having a `File` type option or argument and when it is set to `stdin`: the command ends up with error due to the `Abort` exception being raised when the stdin `EOFError` exception is caught.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this undesirable side effect, prefer to raise the `EOFError` exceptions directly from the prompts functions inside the `CliRunner` class instead of doing it in the method overriding the iterator protcol for the` _NamedTextIOWrapper` class.\r\n\r\nRestore previous implementation of a test broken by changes of 262bdf0.\r\n\r\nFixes #2939.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore opening a PR, open a ticket describing the issue or feature the\r\nPR will address.

think I found a good trade-off solution in https://github.com/pallets/click/pull/2940 that keeps everyone happy.  \n\nAfter further reading of https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/2787 the introduced behavior indeed makes sense to avoid blocking prompts when running tests. \n\nHowever the picked solution, overriding the iterator protocol of the `_NamedTextIOWrapper` class, was the root cause of the regression we observed after the upgrade of click to 8.2.1 (see [example](https://jenkins.softwareheritage.org/job/DENV/job/tests/1793/artifact/swh-core.log)). \n\nI reworked https://github.com/pallets/click/commit/262bdf02288daf9a37b9e815b44acafd62b5c6fe to rather raise the `EOFError` exceptions from the `CliRunner` prompt functions as it fixes the regression while keeping non blocking prompts during tests.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/comments/2902537185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anlambert","id":5493543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert","html_url":"https://github.com/anlambert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17800847508,"node_id":"REFE_lADOASN_zM63zU5pzwAAAAQlA2CU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/17800847508","actor":{"login":"anlambert","id":5493543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert","html_url":"https://github.com/anlambert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b53e2501fb89e7f02c57587a74a8edb730456ee0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anlambert/click/commits/b53e2501fb89e7f02c57587a74a8edb730456ee0","created_at":"2025-05-24T16:57:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17800852640,"node_id":"REFE_lADOASN_zM63zU5pzwAAAAQlA3Sg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/17800852640","actor":{"login":"anlambert","id":5493543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert","html_url":"https://github.com/anlambert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anlambert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ab2382210a2618dcc5f525e54042e0f6455357fa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anlambert/click/commits/ab2382210a2618dcc5f525e54042e0f6455357fa","created_at":"2025-05-24T17:00:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17804879668,"node_id":"SE_lADOASN_zM63zU5pzwAAAAQlQOc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/click/issues/events/17804879668","actor":{"login":"woefe","id":4680564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODA1NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4680564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe","html_url":"https://github.com/woefe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woefe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed
