+/// Due to limitations in rusts proc-macro API there is currently no

+/// external file changes/is added. This implies that `embed_migrations!`
+/// cannot regenerate the list of embedded migrations if **only** the
+/// migrations are changed. This limitation can be solved by adding a
+/// custom `build.rs` file to your crate, such that the crate is rebuild
+/// if the migration directory changes.

+/// Add the following `build.rs` file to your project to fix the problem
