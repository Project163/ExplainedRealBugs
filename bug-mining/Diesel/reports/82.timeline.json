have a debug check for the semi-common error of mislabeling a\r\nfield/expression to a type which is too small. We originally added these\r\nbecause the value would actually deserialize successfully, but to the\r\nwrong value. We didn't add checks for the \"too few bytes\" case, as it\r\nwould have errored anyway and seemed less common.\r\n\r\nHowever, the error message received when one does make this mistake is\r\nnot terribly helpful. We can add an additional check in debug mode to\r\ngive a bit more information when someone does make this mistake.\r\n\r\nWe should see if we can provide some more general improvements to an\r\nerror generated by `DeserializationError` in the future. Including the\r\ncolumn name would go a long way, but is a bit larger in scope.\r\n\r\nFixes #696.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":960374832,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk2MDM3NDgzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/960374832","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"471c283e6038283be0fc4b5b365916bced823fe5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/471c283e6038283be0fc4b5b365916bced823fe5","created_at":"2017-02-13T21:34:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":963473440,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTYzNDczNDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/963473440","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-15T17:20:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
