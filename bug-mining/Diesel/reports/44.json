When a struct is annotated with `#[insertable_into]`, we derive `Insertable` for `&T`. When you attempt to pass an owned `T` to `insert`, you'll get a compilation error when attempting to call `get_result` or similar methods on it. The error message will be along the lines of:\n\n```\nthe method `get_result` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied: `InsertQuery<(column1, column2), InsertStatement<table, YourStruct>> : QueryFragment<_>`\n```\n\nThis is a common enough mistake that we should go out of our way to ensure we have a better error message here. We either need the message to explicitly mention that it expected `&T` and got `T`, or just make this case compile.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
