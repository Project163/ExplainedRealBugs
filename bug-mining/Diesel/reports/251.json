I started with copying and pasting the attributes defined in the Getting Started guide, and then filled in the proper details for my struct according to the generated schema defined in `schema.rs`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: expected one of `{`, lifetime, or type, found `:`\r\n --> server/src/database/models.rs:4:21\r\n  |\r\n4 | #[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]\r\n  |                     ^^^^^^^^^^ expected one of `{`, lifetime, or type\r\n  |\r\n  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Selectable` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\nThere is a separate but probably related error here:\r\n```\r\nerror: proc-macro derive produced unparsable tokens\r\n --> server/src/database/models.rs:4:21\r\n  |\r\n4 | #[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]\r\n  | \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRelevant source (lines 1-7):\r\n```\r\nuse diesel::prelude::*;\r\nuse uuid::Uuid;\r\n\r\n#[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]\r\n#[diesel(table_name = crate::database::schema::account)]\r\n#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::mysql::Mysql))]\r\npub struct Account<'n0, 'n1> {\r\n// ... struct properties are defined here, aligning with schema.rs\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot share the migration file, or the schema itself, I can point out that it uses the UUID type in MySQL and aligns that with the `Uuid` struct defined by the `uuid` package.\r\n\r\nSegment of cargo.toml\r\n```\r\n[dependencies]\r\nprost = \"0.11.9\"\r\ntonic = \"0.9.2\"\r\ntokio = { version = \"1.28.2\", features = [\"macros\", \"rt-multi-thread\"] }\r\ntonic-reflection = \"0.9.2\"\r\ndiesel = { version = \"2.1.0\", features = [\"mysql\", \"uuid\"] }\r\ndotenvy = \"0.15\"\r\nuuid = \"1.4.1\"\r\n\r\n[build-dependencies]\r\ntonic-build = \"0.9.2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) and the [discussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions) for similar possible closed issues.\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are unsure if your issue is a duplicate of an existing issue please link the issue in question here\r\n--> \r\n- [X] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
