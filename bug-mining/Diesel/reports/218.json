Cargo will sometimes reuse the previously built binary instead of building a new one, because it didn't realize its cache became invalid. This happens when I'm only adding new files to the `migrations` directory.\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nBuild a binary to run the Diesel migrations.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nThe binary produced by `cargo build` should run all of the migration files, including the most recent ones.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\nCargo didn't rebuild the crate, and the binary is now outdated. As a result, if I run the binary, recent migrations will be missing.\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n`/src/bin/run-migrations.rs`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[macro_use]\r\nextern crate diesel_migrations;\r\n\r\nuse common_infra::config;\r\nuse diesel::{pg::PgConnection, prelude::*};\r\n\r\n// path relative to Cargo.toml\r\nembed_migrations!(\"./migrations\");\r\n\r\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\r\n    let connspec = config::get_plain_url(\"Database\")?;\r\n    let conn = PgConnection::establish(&connspec)?;\r\n\r\n    info!(\"Applying migrations\");\r\n    embedded_migrations::run_with_output(&conn, &mut std::io::stdout())?;\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run `cargo build`\r\n- Add a new migration\r\n- Run `cargo build` again, and observe that cargo skipped the build.\r\n\r\nThe resulting binary misses the additional SQL migration.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues)  and the [discussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions)  for similar possible closed issues.\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel. (Your issue will be\r\n  closed if this is not the case)\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced without requiring a third party crate\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nIt is possible to invalidate the build cache with a `/build.rs` file:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::fs::create_dir_all;\r\n\r\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\r\n    println!(\"cargo:rerun-if-changed=migrations\");\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/3119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/3119/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
