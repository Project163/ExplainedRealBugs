There's a couple of things to consider\n\nEdit: The thoughts in this comment are super outdated, and likely no longer relevant.\n- Right now `Table::PrimaryKey` has the constraint `Column<Table=Self>`. Unsure if we want to relax that to `SelectableExpression`, or if we want to introduce the `Columns` trait. We could even implement `Column` for tuples now if we really want to, as there's no longer any automatically added behaviors.\n- With the way our type system is set up, `conn.find(&posts_tags, &(1, 1))` would be more likely to generate `SELECT * FROM posts_tags WHERE (post_id, tag_id) = $1`, instead of `SELECT * FROM posts_tags WHERE post_id = $1 AND tag_id = $2`. Might be fine for an initial implementation, but we do eventually need to solve this to support other databases.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/42/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
