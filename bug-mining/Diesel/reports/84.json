Ultimately the problem comes down to the fact that we are writing impls like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<T, QS> SelectableExpression<QS> for NotNull<T> where\r\n    T: SelectableExpression<QS>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the second parameter of `SelectableExpression` defaults to the SQL type of the expression, and that changes to be nullable if we're on the right side of a left outer join, the where clause resolves to the wrong SQL type.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to change the second parameter of `SelectableExpression` to be an associated type, not a type parameter. Either by going forward with #6, or with a smaller change.","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
