Your speed and willingness to help is amazing!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm encountering further issues when using r2d2 with MySQL. Whenever I try to run a query, like:\r\n\r\n    users::table.limit(5).load::<User>(&*conn).expect(\"Users load failed\")\r\n\r\nI get \r\n\r\n    DatabaseError(__Unknown, \"Commands out of sync; you can\\'t run this command now\")\r\n\r\nWhen I get a connection directly using `MysqlConnection::establish`, everything works fine.\r\n\r\nI dug around a little bit, and it is definitely related to the query in the `is_valid` health check. I put together an alternate impl for `::r2d2::ManageConnection` where `is_valid` always returned `Ok(())`, and it worked fine. (Of course, that is not a viable solution for the managed connection.)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
