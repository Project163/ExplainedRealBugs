Am I correct?\n\nAnother issue I encountered was that I can't write `donate::table.select((donate::name, diesel::expression::sum(donate::amount)))`. It type-errors:\n\n```\nsrc/eventer.rs:189:31: 189:37 error: the trait `diesel::expression::SelectableExpression<eventer::donate::table, _>` is not implemented for the type `(eventer::donate::columns::name, diesel::expression::functions::aggregate_folding::Sum<eventer::donate::columns::amount>)` [E0277]\n```\n\nSo I ended up working around the two issues above by using `sql`, such like:\n\n``` rust\ndonate::table.select((donate::name, sql::<Text>(\"sum(amount) AS sum\")))\n             .filter(sql(\"TRUE GROUP BY name\"))\n             .order(sql::<Text>(\"sum\").desc())\n             .load(&*db).unwrap();\n```\n\nOne more thing: I had to use `sql::<Text>(\"sum\")` because without `::<Text>`, type inference fails. Though `Text` isn't exactly sane in this case, I'd say...\n\nAny ideas?
