One foreseeable issue is that this prevents moving to Travis' new container infrastructure, which offers features like caching.\n\nAny thoughts on possible alternatives?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/170/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/178126807","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/167#issuecomment-178126807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/167","id":178126807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3ODEyNjgwNw==","user":{"login":"emptyflash","id":2703156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2703156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash","html_url":"https://github.com/emptyflash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emptyflash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-01T18:52:03Z","updated_at":"2016-02-01T19:03:42Z","body":"Agreed.

you want to report a bug, we added some points below you can fill out.

I realize that columns in which said field are `null` will not be part of the index, but that is acceptable to me.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nA working schema.rs file.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\nNothing\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nDeploy the schema from above, and run `diesel print-schema` on it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease include as much of your codebase as needed to reproduce the error.  If the relevant files are large, please consider linking to a public repository or a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).\r\n\r\nPlease post as much of your database schema as necessary. If you are using `infer_schema!`, you can use `diesel print-schema` and post the relevant parts from that.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
