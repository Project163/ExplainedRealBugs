While technically you can run into the same problem with `SELECT 1 + NULL`, we don't actually implement `Add` for `Nullable<Anything>`. So another way to put this is that the problem only applies in cases where we have an _unbounded_ constraint on the input types. At first glance, that appears to only apply to infix predicates which return a boolean (and `IsNull`/`IsNotNull`, but this doesn't apply to those for obvious reasons).\n\nGiven the idea of \"truthy\"/\"falsey\" in other languages, I think that treating `NULL` as `false` is a reasonably comfortable conversion. This would not remove the idea of a `Nullable<Bool>`, which you could certainly still have as a column. It would only affect cases that we at present cannot correctly handles, which is `nullable_expression.eq(other_nullable_expression)`.\n\nAs a side note, if we ignore other backends, this problem is not solved by just mapping `Eq` to `IS DISTINCT FROM` in PG. `IS DISTINCT FROM` is not treated as an operator, so we cannot do things like `x IS DISTINCT FROM ANY(some_array)`. The problem also applies to cases like `>` and `<`.\n\nI'm starting to become amicable to this over a solution which changes the type to `Nullable<Bool>`, as unless we suddenly decide to allow `T` to be comparable to `Nullable<T>`, which we currently prevent by design, any case involving `NULL` would bubble up through `AND` in painful ways. For example `x.eq(y).and(nullable_x.eq(nullable_y))` would not compile, as both sides would need to be `Nullable`.\n\nOther cases where this does apply in SQL are essentially functions, and operators like `+`, which do have bounded input. We don't currently have elegant handling of multiple types for functions, but for operators like `+`, it's completely possible with our types as set up today to have `Nullable<Integer> + Nullable<Integer>` return `Nullable<Integer>`. What is not possible today is to have `Integer + Nullable<Integer>` (looking through the commit history, I'm not sure I fully understand why I wrote `Rhs` as an associated type, and not a type parameter. Presumably it's due to wanting to use `AsExpression`, and the inability to say `impl<Rhs> ::std::ops::Add<Rhs> where { there is exactly one type for which \"AsExpression\" is implemented on Rhs, and ::diesel::ops::Add exists }` but I need to confirm.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/172281522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/172282033","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/104#issuecomment-172282033","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/104","id":172282033,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjI4MjAzMw==","user":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-17T01:18:18Z","updated_at":"2016-01-17T01:18:18Z","body":"Interesting point from IRC: We could actually handle `Eq` similarly to `Add`, where we have a `EqResult` trait of some kind with a known output. This would require adding brute force impls for every native type, but we can remove a lot of that pain with macros, similarly to how we handle `Add` for numeric types, and `Queriable`/`AsExpression` for primitive types. This would also enable us to add equality comparisons that we don't support today like `varchar.eq(text)`. We'd still have the same `x.eq(y).and(nullable_x.eq(nullable_y))`, but we might be able to figure out some way to implement `impl<T: Expression<SqlType=Bool>> AsExpression<Nullable<Bool>> for T` that doesn't overlap with our existing `impl<T: Expression> AsExpression<T::SqlType> for T`\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/172282033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":517129833,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDUxNzEyOTgzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/517129833","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-17T01:33:45Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":517129862,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDUxNzEyOTg2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/517129862","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-17T01:33:47Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/172606071","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/104#issuecomment-172606071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/104","id":172606071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjYwNjA3MQ==","user":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-18T17:54:02Z","updated_at":"2016-01-18T17:54:02Z","body":"I've

This PR rolls up commits from a few others. Review might be easier if it's done one commit at a time.\r\n\r\nThe `SelectableExpression` trait serves two purposes for us. The first and most important role it fills is to ensure that columns from tables that aren't in the from clause cannot be used. The second way that we use it to make columns which are on the right side of a left outer join be nullable.\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons that we used a type parameter instead of an associated type. The first was to make it so that `(Nullable<X>, Nullable<Y>)` could be treated as `Nullable<(X, Y)>`. We did this because the return type of `users.left_outer_join(posts)` should be `(User, Option<Post>)`, not `(User, Post)` where every field of `Post` is an `Option`.\r\n\r\nSince we now provide a `.nullable()` method in the core DSL, I think we can simply require calling that method explicitly if you want that tuple conversion to occur. I think that the most common time that conversion will even be used is when the default select clause is used, where we can just handle it for our users automatically.\r\n\r\nThe other reason that we went with a type parameter originally was that it was easier, since we can provide a default value for a type parameter but not an associated type. This turned out to actually be a drawback, as it led to #104. This PR actually brings back aspects of that issue, which I'll get to in a moment.\r\n\r\nIt's expected that any expression which implements `SelectableExpression<QS>` have a `T: SelectableExpression<QS>` bound for each of its parts. The problem is, the missing second parameter is defaulting to `T::SqlType`, which means we are implicitly saying that this bound only applies for `QS` which does not change the SQL type (anything except a left outer join). This ultimately led to #621.\r\n\r\nHowever, with our current structure, it is impossible to fix #621 without re-introducing at least some aspects of #104. In https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/104#issuecomment-172281522 I said that we didn't need to worry about `1 + NULL`, because we didn't implement add for any nullable types. However, I'm not sure I considered joins when I made that statement. The statement applied to joins previously because of that implicit \"sql type doesn't change\" constraint. This commit removes that constraint, meaning #104 will be back at least when the nullability comes from being on the right side of a left join.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a serious enough issue that we need to immediately address it, as the types of queries which would cause the issue still just don't happen in practice. We should come up with a long term plan for it, though. Ultimately the nullability of a field really only matters in the select clause. Since any operation on null returns null, and you basically want null to act as false in the where clasue, it doesn't matter there.\r\n\r\nSo one partial step we could take is to break this out into two separate traits. One for the \"make sure this is valid given the from clause\", and one for the \"make this nullable sometimes\" case and only constrain on the first one in the where clause. We could then re-add the \"sql type doesn't change\" constraint on the problem cases, which will bring back aspects of #621, but only for select clauses which is a smaller problem.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I ultimately want to go the two traits route or not. If nothing else, the problem cases are much more obvious with this commit.  Anywhere that has `type SqlTypeForSelect = Self::SqlType` is likely a problem case when joins are involved. This will make it easier to find all the places to apply a solution when I come up with one that I'm happy with.\r\n\r\nOne last note about this is that it makes `BoxableExpression` that much less ergonomic to use, since now two associated types have to be specified instead of one. There's not much we can do about that (it might be helped by the two trait path), and I'm really not sure if that type is even useful since we now have the boxed queries DSL.\r\n\r\nFixes

change in #709 had the side effect of re-introducing #104.\r\nWith the design that we have right now, nullability isn't propagating\r\nupwards. This puts the issue of \"expressions aren't validating that the\r\ntype of its arguments haven't become nullable, and thus nulls are\r\nslipping in where they shouldn't be\" at odds with \"we can't use complex\r\nexpressions in filters for joins because the SQL type changed\".\r\n\r\nThis semi-resolves the issue by restricting when we care about\r\nnullability. Ultimately the only time it really matters is when we're\r\nselecting data, as we need to enforce that the result goes into an\r\n`Option`. For places where we don't see the bytes in Rust (filter,\r\norder, etc), `NULL` is effectively `false`.\r\n\r\nThis change goes back to fully fixing #104, but brings back a small\r\npiece of #621. I've changed everything that is a composite expression to\r\nonly be selectable if the SQL type hasn't changed. This means that you\r\nwon't be able to do things like\r\n`users.left_outer_join(posts).select(posts::id + 1)`, but you will be\r\nable to use whatever you want in `filter`.\r\n\r\nThis change is also to support what I think will fix the root of all\r\nthese issues. The design of \"Here's the SQL type on this query source\"\r\nis just fundamentally not what we need. There is only one case where the\r\ntype changes, and that is to become null when it is on the right side of\r\na left join, the left side of a right join, or either side of a full\r\njoin.\r\n\r\nOne of the changes that #709 made was to require that you explicitly\r\ncall `.nullable()` on a tuple if you wanted to get `Option<(i32,\r\nString)>` instead of `(Option<i32>, Option<String>)`. This has worked\r\nout fine, and isn't a major ergonomic pain. The common case is just to\r\nuse the default select clause anyway. So I want to go further down this\r\npath.\r\n\r\nThe longer term plan is to remove `SqlTypeForSelect` entirely, and *not*\r\nimplement `SelectableExpression` for columns on the nullable side of a\r\njoin. We will then provide these two blanket impls:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<Left, Right, T> SelectableExpression<LeftOuterJoin<Left, Right>>\r\n    for Nullable<T> where T: SelectableExpression<Right>,\r\n{}\r\n\r\nimpl<Left, Right, Head, Tail> SelectableExpression<LeftOuterJoin<Left, Right>>\r\n    for Nullable<Cons<Head, Tail>> where\r\n        Nullable<Head>: SelectableExpression<LeftOuterJoin<Left, Right>>,\r\n        Nullable<Tail>: SelectableExpression<LeftOuterJoin<Left, Right>>,\r\n{}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note: Those impls overlap. Providing them as blanket impls would\r\nrequire https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/40097. Providing them as\r\nnon-blanket impls would require us to mark `Nullable` and possibly\r\n`Cons` as `#[fundamental]`)\r\n\r\nThe end result will be that nullability naturally propagates as we want\r\nit to. Given `sql_function!(lower, lower_t, (x: Text) -> Text)`, doing\r\n`select(lower(posts::name).nullable())` will work. `lower(posts::name)`\r\nwill fail because `posts::name` doesn't impl `SelectableExpression`.\r\n`lower(posts::name.nullable())` will fail because while\r\n`SelectableExpression` will be met, the SQL type of the argument isn't\r\nwhat's expected. Putting `.nullable` at the very top level naturally\r\nfollows SQL's semantics here.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/764/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":977492384,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk3NzQ5MjM4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/977492384","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c9fc9885abbf2eba2fcbd4cea6e87ee58a90c4d0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/c9fc9885abbf2eba2fcbd4cea6e87ee58a90c4d0","created_at":"2017-02-26T17:19:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":985913146,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk4NTkxMzE0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/985913146","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6dec748273b29e95806ccc6a429c93dc4b2bf36d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/6dec748273b29e95806ccc6a429c93dc4b2bf36d","created_at":"2017-03-03T19:21:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-14T15:25:49Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T15:25:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1459","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1459/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1459/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1459/events","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1459","id":286583766,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODY1ODM3NjY=","number":1459,"title":"`left_join`

#2274\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this was originally a bug or not, but in any case as described on the issue, often the NotNull field (say, `zzz::some_nullable_thing.is_not_null()`) doesn't have any meaning if we couldn't left_join on the `zzz` table and select the NULL field (say, `zzz::id`).\r\n\r\nThis is why I'm very happy to not have access to the second field if the first field is NULL.\r\n\r\nHowever I can't think of a scenario where I'd prefer a runtime error: cases where I could unintentionally \"forget\" a field should be covered by the typing after the query: \"Why can't I get the value of this field? Oh it's because it was packed in this `Option`...)\r\n\r\nThis is why I beleive that this behaviour that ends up giving `Ok(None)` instead of `Err(DeserializationError(UnexpectedNullError))` is better.\r\n\r\n~~Accorging to the tests this implementation seems to work properly, though I'm not sure why recovering from the error skips the proper amount of fields... Can anyone confirm that (and why) this indeed behaves as expected ? :)~~\r\nEDIT: This indeed did not skip the proper amount of fields, and is now fixed.\r\n\r\nAlso open to any comments
