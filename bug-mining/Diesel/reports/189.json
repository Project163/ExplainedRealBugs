This is an informal convention that tools can use to recognise generated files. [This issue in the rustfmt repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3958) discusses other tools that include or recoginse `@generated`. Notably Cargo includes it in a comment at the top of `Cargo.lock`:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n# This file is automatically @generated by Cargo.\r\n# It is not intended for manual editing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient if the `schema.rs` generated by `diesel_cli` included this text in a comment at the top of the file so that `rustfmt` will skip it, avoiding churn/manually reverting the changes made by `cargo fmt`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.","closed_by":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
