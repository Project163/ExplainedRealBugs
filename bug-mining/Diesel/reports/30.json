We need to fix it before we can merge into master, but I really am at my wits end about this. We've had to change our build infrastructure, because travis doesn't have a \"not fucking ancient\" option for the SQLite version. By default they ship a version from 2011, and we rely on `sqlite3_errstr`, which was added in 2012.\n\nThe new infrastructure _should_ be using a more recent version, but for some reason we fail to compile when we get to codgen. There is absolutely no reason I can think of that this would fail at codegen, but the main crate would continue to compile.\n\nWe need to figure out some way to get the build green, either by getting travis working with the code as is, or by removing our dependency on `sqlite3_errstr` and switching back to the container infrastructure.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
