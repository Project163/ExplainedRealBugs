actually think boxing the where clauses by default would have been the right way to go. Unfortunately, we can't change that now that we're post-1.0. I'm definitely interested in having `BoxedUpdateStatement` and `BoxedDeleteStatement` though. The API surface on those is relatively small. I don't think we need to support upsert for boxed update statements (unless it's easy to add support). Boxed update statements should box the values as well as the where clause.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to mentor someone interested in working on this. It'll be a decent sized patch, but it's pretty straightforward once you understand the basics of our codebase, and `BoxedSelectStatement` is a perfect reference for this, as the implementation will be quite similar.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/358444900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1429155914,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE0MjkxNTU5MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/1429155914","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-17T21:05:37Z","label":{"name":"mentoring

is one half of #1128. This method (and the added type) correspond\r\nto `SelectStatement::into_boxed` and `BoxedSelecStatement`. I had\r\noriginally stated that I thought we could just box the where clause by\r\ndefault, but we could no longer do that due to backwards compatibility.\r\nNeither of those statements are actually true.\r\n\r\nWhile we can't remove the type parameter for the where clause, it is\r\ndocumented that you are not allowed to rely on the types that parameter\r\ncan hold, or make any assumptions about them. So we could either change\r\nit to be an unused parameter, or enforce that it is always a boxed where\r\nclause.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can't just change it to be unused, as we need to capture a\r\nlifetime somewhere. So if we wanted to re-use `DeleteStatement` for\r\nthis, we'd have to go the second route of having that parameter always\r\nbe a boxed where clause. I realize now that we don't actually want to do\r\nthat though, as it would require `delete` to take the database the query\r\nwould be run against.\r\n\r\nThere's more duplicated code than I'd like (basically all of this code\r\nwas copied from either `DeleteStatement` or `BoxedSelectStatement`, but\r\nI'm not sure that there's a ton we can do about this. It's unfortunate\r\nthat we basically have to remember to update `BoxedDeleteStatement` any\r\ntime we do anything to `DeleteStatement`, but that's no different than\r\nthe situation with selects.\r\n\r\nWhile conditionally modifying the where clause of a delete statement is\r\ndefinitely going to be less common than doing it for a select, I do\r\nthink that this is a reasonable feature, and one worth having.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/370261087","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1128#issuecomment-370261087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1128","id":370261087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MDI2MTA4Nw==","user":{"login":"ivanovaleksey","id":11523473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11523473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey","html_url":"https://github.com/ivanovaleksey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanovaleksey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-04T20:27:52Z","updated_at":"2018-03-04T20:27:52Z","body":"I
