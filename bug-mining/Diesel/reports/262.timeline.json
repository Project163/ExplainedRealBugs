ANY (VALUES (ARRAY['foo']), (ARRAY['bar']))` works, so it looks like as a `VALUES` subquery in the `Many` specialization would also work (and maybe generate query plans that match better the `= ANY

Using the type metadata (array_oid of array is zero): we can't ATM because that requires having a connection (for MetadataLookup), which we don't have for the `ToSql` AST pass (notably for debug reasons)\n2. Adding that information to the `SqlType` trait.\n  a. We could have that as a type like is done for `IsNullable` but that may not be worth the additional complexity (and/or breaking changes), considering that \"`associated type defaults are unstable` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29661)\"... but maybe that's fine because that is mostly (always?) derived anyway?\n  b. It doesn't necessarily need to be a type though: even if it's just an associated const we could use it in the `QueryFragment` implementation. If it's just an associated const we can't use that to [restrict compilation of additional array nesting](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/ce6fa0bd93877391665254d9bdb23a9c895902ef/diesel/src/pg/types/array.rs#L12-L14) though, because \"`associated const equality is incomplete`
