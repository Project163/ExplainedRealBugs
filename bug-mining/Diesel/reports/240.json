Unfortunately, the error message produced by the macro has an unhelpful message and an incorrect span:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: proc-macro derive panicked\r\n --> src/main.rs:3:10\r\n  |\r\n3 | #[derive(Insertable)]\r\n  |          ^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = help: message: expected identifier\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, the error message would look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror[E0560]: struct `Foo` has no field named `type`\r\n --> src/main.rs:7:9\r\n  |\r\n5 |        #[column_name = \"type\"]\r\n  |                        ^^^^^^ help: a field with a similar name exists: `type_`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error message does not only help when trying to use a name that is an invalid identifier in rust, but also when there is a typo in the column name.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2792#issuecomment-846581411","closed_by":{"login":"pksunkara","id":174703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/174703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara","html_url":"https://github.com/pksunkara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
