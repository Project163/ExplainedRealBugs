As soon as I add the line `infer_schema!(\"dotenv:DATABASE_URL\");` anywhere in my project, I get the error mentioned in the title: `error: no rules expected the token ')'`. I can't for the life of me figure out what it means or what causes it. \r\n\r\nMy .env file exists and is fine, as the diesel command line tool has no objections with it. I'm importing diesel and diesel_codegen in the correct order in my lib.rs, as I've seen that sometimes causes problems. I have also tried varying import statements, though none are required in any of the examples.\r\n\r\nI have tried building the examples, and they work fine. That leads me to believe it's a problem in my project, however, I have no idea where to start looking, as this error is pretty cryptic.\r\n\r\nRust version: rustc 1.15.1 (021bd294c 2017-02-08)\r\nDiesel version: 0.11.4\r\nDiesel features: mysql\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/754/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
