commit removes the unsound `SerializedDatabase::new` function from the stable API. Semver explicitly allows breaking changes for critical bug fixes and I would classify fixing soundness bugs as critical so this should be fine to do.\r\n\r\nPractical speaking I wouldn't expect anyone to use that function anyway as the only reasonable use of `SerializedDatabase` is to be produced bye the `SqliteConnection::serialize_database_to_buffer` function. The corresponding\r\n`SqliteConnection::deserialize_readonly_database_from_buffer` function accepts a `&[u8]` buffer that can be allocated on the rust side.
