for issue #3673, I encountered an error related to a stack overflow when executing `diesel migration run` with `COPY public.\"name\" (id) FROM stdin;`. In order to reproduce the issue, I copied the SQL code from my [pg_dump](https://gist.github.com/df51d/51e5ae9b2bb52ca40014f2235a7e8c55#file-pg_dump-sql-L225) and included it in the diesel migration script.\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n```diesel migration run```\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n```\r\nRunning migration user\r\n\r\nthread 'main' has overflowed its stack\r\nfatal runtime error: stack overflow\r\n[1]    36976 IOT instruction (core dumped)  diesel migration run\r\n```\r\n### Steps to reproduce \r\n```bash\r\ndocker pull postgres\r\n\r\ndocker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres\r\n\r\necho 'DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/db\"' > .env\r\n\r\ndiesel setup\r\n\r\nmkdir migrations/user\r\n\r\necho \"CREATE TABLE public.\\\"user\\\" (\r\n    id integer NOT NULL\r\n);\r\nCOPY public.\\\"user\\\" (id) FROM stdin;\" > migrations/user/up.sql\r\n    \r\ndiesel migration run\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Related bug with COPY\r\nWhen I include end of a COPY statement `\\.` like in my [pg_dump](https://gist.github.com/df51d/51e5ae9b2bb52ca40014f2235a7e8c55#file-pg_dump-sql-L226) it gave me instead this error:\r\n```\r\nRunning migration user\r\nFailed to run user with: syntax error at or near \"\\\"\r\n```\r\n[postgres copy docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/sql-copy.html)\r\n```\r\nEnd of data can be represented by a single line containing just backslash-period (\\.).\r\n An end-of-data marker is not necessary when reading from a file, since the end of file \r\nserves perfectly well; it is needed only when copying data to or from client\r\napplications using pre-3.0 client protocol.\r\n```\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) and the [discussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions) for similar possible closed issues.\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are unsure if your issue is a duplicate of an existing issue please link the issue in question here\r\n--> \r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
