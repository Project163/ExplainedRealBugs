If you want to request a feature, feel free to remove all the irrelevant text. In addition to this [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues), you can also talk to Diesel maintainers and users on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** any\r\n- **Diesel:** any\r\n- **Database:** any\r\n- **Operating System** any\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:**\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\n\r\nParenthesis inserted in Rust to override order of operations are lost in the generated SQL. This can also occur when a value is assigned to a local variable. This will at best result in an incorrect value being generated, and at worst will result in a runtime error because of incorrect types (e.g. `interval * (integer - integer)` is valid but `interval * integer - integer` is not)\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\n`14`\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\n`10`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn test(conn: &Connection) {\r\n    let x = select(2.into_sql::<Integer>() * (3.into_sql::<Integer>() + 4))\r\n        .get_result(conn);\r\n    assert_eq!(Ok(14), x);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease include as much of your codebase as needed to reproduce the error.  If the relevant files are large, please consider linking to a public repository or a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).\r\n\r\nPlease post as much of your database schema as necessary. If you are using `infer_schema!`, you can use `diesel print-schema` and post the relevant parts from that.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel. (Your issue will be\r\n  closed if this is not the case)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your submission!
