#2950\r\n\r\nPreviously, if fields had `embed`, the `Selectable` derive supposed that they implemented `Selectable<DB>` for every `DB: Backend`.\r\n\r\nIf that wasn't the case (generic subfield or backend-specific impl) the derive would fail.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this issue by introducing the appropriate additional `where`
