main benefit of doing this is that we can implement `Connection` for\r\n`PooledConnection`, removing the requirement to do `&*conn` in your\r\noutermost functions. Additionally, we can just re-export r2d2 from\r\nwithin Diesel itself, so we can hopefully get fewer bug reports saying\r\n\"Hey why does it say PgConnection doesn't implement Connection\". Instead\r\npeople can just `use diesel::r2d2::Pool` instead of explicitly depending\r\non r2d2.\r\n\r\nThe code and the tests are both stripped straight from r2d2-diesel.\r\n(Yeah, the tests are a bit... opaque. They come from the initial commit\r\nof that repo, with the commit message \"The tests have been pretty much\r\nripped from r2d2-postgres, as I really don't know what else to do to\r\ntest this\". So blame r2d2-postgres I guess)\r\n\r\nThe only changes between this code and what is in r2d2-diesel 1.0 is the\r\n`Connection` impl. This impl has to be a little bit funky. I decided to\r\njust restrict to `AnsiTransactionManager` since that's what all three\r\nbackends use at the moment. If we wanted to support anything that\r\nimplemented `diesel::Connection`, we would need to add the constraint\r\n`C::TransactionManager: TransactionManager<Self>`. However,\r\n`TransactionManager` has the bound that it's parameter be `Connection`,\r\nso we just recurse infinitely. Maybe on day the language will be smarter\r\nabout this. Until then, we just have to do this weird hack.\r\n\r\nFixes
