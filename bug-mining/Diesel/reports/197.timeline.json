continues the changes made in #1763. Since that PR was merged, one\r\nof the non-code steps has been taken care of -- All users hitting any\r\nendpoint with `?page=20` (which is an arbitrary search pattern that\r\nseemed high enough to give any crawlers going through pagination) have\r\nbeen contacted about the change, with a PR opened against any that\r\nincluded a repo. (Intersting aside, there are *zero* records of this for\r\nany endpoint other than search, which perhaps implies we can get rid of\r\na few of these endpoints, but that's a separate discussion).\r\n\r\nThis PR does not change any functionality, but moves some code around\r\nto better encapsulate things for upcoming changes. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Change our frontend to show \"next/prev page\" links on the all crates\r\n  page\r\n- Stop returning the \"total\" meta item when the next/prev page links\r\n  will be cursor based (which I'd actually just like to start omitting\r\n  in general)\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this change was to stop having any code outside of\r\n`Paginated` (which has been renamed to `PaginatedQuery`, as there's a\r\nnew type called `Paginated`) care about how pagination occurs. This\r\nmeans other code can't care about *how* pagination happens (with the\r\nexception of `reverse_dependencies`, which uses raw SQL, and sorta has\r\nto... That was a bit of a rabbit hole, see\r\nhttps://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2150 for details. Given the\r\nlow traffic to that endpoint, I think we can safely ignore it).\r\n\r\nThe distribution of responsibilities is as follows:\r\n\r\n- `PaginatedQuery<T>`: Given the query params, decides how to paginate\r\n  things, generates appropriate SQL, loads a `Paginated<T>`.\r\n- `Paginated<T>`: Handles providing an iterator to the records, getting\r\n  the total count (to be removed in the near future), providing the\r\n  next/prev page params\r\n- `Request`: Takes the pagination related query params, turns that into\r\n  an actual URL (note: Due to jankiness in our router, this will only\r\n  ever be a query string, we have no way of getting the actual path)\r\n\r\nThe next step from here is to change our UI to stop showing page\r\nnumbers, and then remove the `total` field.\r\n\r\nThis PR will introduce a performance regression that was addressed by\r\n #1668. That PR was addressing \"this will become a problem in a future\",\r\nnot \"this is about to take the site down\". Given the intent to remove\r\nthe `total` field entirely, I think it is fine to cause this regression\r\nin the short term. If we aren't confident that the changes to remove\r\nthis field will land in the near future, or want to be conservative\r\nabout this, I can add some additional complexity/git churn to retain

second part of this issue should be fixed after the type system rewrite in #2182. This leaves the first, simple part of the issue. I'm marking this as `help wanted` as I think this is fairly easy to implement.\r\n\r\n> The fix for this is basically to add a (default empty impl for backwards compat) function to QueryBuilder which is informed when push_bind_param_value_only is called, which increments the bind counter and does nothing else. Importantly, this means that it would be valid to add more bind params through the query builder after the SqlQuery is walked, but not before. So SELECT * FROM ({sql_query}) LIMIT $1 is fine, SELECT *, $1 FROM ({sql_query}) is not -- or at least the query passed to it needs to be aware that its indexes need to start from 2.\r\n\r\n> We could theoretically detect this at runtime by erroring if push_bind_param_value_only is called after push_bind_param. We could even do this only for PG. I opted not to in my (unopened) PR both for simplicity, and because having a sql_query which is expected to be passed to some other combinator like paginate on use is completely valid, so I don't want to make writing these queries with all hand-written SQL starting at $2 impossible.\r\n\r\n> I also don't think this vector for misuse is particularly common. This interaction is only when writing generic code that abstracts over entire queries. That means by definition it's going to be wrapping that query in a subselect as part of the FROM clause or a CTE. While there are reasons you could have a bind param in front of that, it's substantially less common than having it after.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/703714424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3841146651,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4NDExNDY2NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/3841146651","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-05T15:40:33Z","label":{"name":"help

is the last missing piece to allow code to abstract both, over\r\nqueries generated by `sql_query` and queries constructed using diesels\r\nquery dsl.\r\n\r\nTo quote from the original issue:\r\n\r\n> The fix for this is basically to add a (default empty impl for backwards compat) function to QueryBuilder which is informed when push_bind_param_value_only is called, which increments the bind counter and does nothing else. Importantly, this means that it would be valid to add more bind params through the query builder after the SqlQuery is walked, but not before. So SELECT * FROM ({sql_query}) LIMIT $1 is fine, SELECT *, $1 FROM ({sql_query}) is not -- or at least the query passed to it needs to be aware that its indexes need to start from 2.\r\n\r\n> We could theoretically detect this at runtime by erroring if push_bind_param_value_only is called after push_bind_param. We could even do this only for PG. I opted not to in my (unopened) PR both for simplicity, and because having a sql_query which is expected to be passed to some other combinator like paginate on use is completely valid, so I don't want to make writing these queries with all hand-written SQL starting at $2 impossible.\r\n\r\n> I also don't think this vector for misuse is particularly common. This interaction is only when writing generic code that abstracts over entire queries. That means by definition it's going to be wrapping that query in a subselect as part of the FROM clause or a CTE. While there are reasons you could have a bind param in front of that, it's substantially less common than having it after.\r\n\r\nFixes #2150","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3859044735,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg1OTA0NDczNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/3859044735","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-09T08:29:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
