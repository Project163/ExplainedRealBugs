Namely oracle/oci. Therefore I need to implement e.g. ```InternalSaveChangesDsl```. Since all oracle/oci related code is currently outside of diesel, it is impossible to implement this. Please note that I made `save_changes_dsl` public.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n```\r\nerror[E0210]: type parameter `T` must be used as the type parameter for some local type (e.g. `MyStruct<T>`); only traits defined in the current crate can be implemented for a type parameter\r\n  --> src/oracle/query_dsl/save_changes_dsl.rs:15:1\r\n   |\r\n15 | / impl<T, U> InternalSaveChangesDsl<OciConnection, U> for T\r\n16 | |     where\r\n17 | |         T: Copy + Identifiable,\r\n18 | |         T: AsChangeset<Target = <T as HasTable>::Table> + IntoUpdateTarget,\r\n...  |\r\n26 | |     }\r\n27 | | }\r\n   | |_^\r\n```\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nThere is some code at https://github.com/GiGainfosystems/diesel-oci/tree/feature/save_changes_dsl available.
