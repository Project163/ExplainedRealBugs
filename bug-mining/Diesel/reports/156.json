SQLite has no concept of this type. We can't really have the return type of `avg` be dependent on the backend (since we don't know the backend at the point `avg` is called). So we probably need to add some \"support\" for `Numeric` on SQLite. We should never infer this from `diesel print-schema` or anything like that, but we do need to do `impl HasSqlType<Numeric> for Sqlite`, and provide a `FromSql` impl for something there.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether we should have `Numeric` pretend to be `Text`, and provide a `FromSql` impl for `BigDecimal`, or whether we should have it pretend to be `Double` and provide an impl for `f64`. I'm guessing it should be the latter, since the floating point precision issues will happen on the DB side, but I'd like to see a query that demonstrates that `avg(int_column)` will in fact be limited by 64 bit float precision on SQLite regardless of what we do on our end.","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1409/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
