If you change the `diesel` and `diesel_codegen` version to 0.14 and `dotenv`'s to 0.9 you'll see that it compiles and runs without problems.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease include as much of your codebase as needed to reproduce the error.  If the relevant files are large, please consider linking to a public repository or a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).\r\n\r\nPlease post as much of your database schema as necessary. If you are using `infer_schema!`, you can use `diesel print-schema` and post the relevant parts from that.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your submission!
