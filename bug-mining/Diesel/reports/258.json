Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust: 1.78.0**\r\n- **Diesel: 2.2.0**\r\n- **Database: sqlite**\r\n- **Operating System: debian trixie**\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel: sqlite**\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\n\r\ni'm following along with the \"relations\" tutorial using an sqlite database, and i'm running into a compile error when using a tuple for `.select()` as shown here: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/2.2.x/examples/postgres/relations/src/main.rs#L147\r\n\r\nNOTE: i was able to workaround this issue by manually specifying the return value of the `.load()` call, as in:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet attrs = BookAuthor::belonging_to(&author)\r\n      .inner_join(authors::table)\r\n      .select((BookAuthor::as_select(), Author::as_select()))\r\n      .load::<(BookAuthor, Author)>(conn);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**build error**\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nerror[E0283]: type annotations needed\r\n    --> src/main.rs:155:18\r\n     |\r\n155  |

ST6, ST7, ST8, Untyped), __DB>>\r\n             and 23 others\r\n     = note: required for `(SelectBy<BookAuthor, Sqlite>, SelectBy<Author, Sqlite>)` to implement `load_dsl::private::CompatibleType<_, Sqlite>`\r\n     = note: required for `SelectStatement<FromClause<JoinOn<..., ...>>, ..., ..., ...>` to implement `LoadQuery<'_, diesel::SqliteConnection, _>`\r\nnote: required by a bound in `diesel::RunQueryDsl::load`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\ni'm trying to perform an `inner_join` on a many-to-many relationship with sqlite as the database engine.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nport the `relations` postgres example directly to `SqliteConnection`, using the same schema and model and then try to build.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n-
