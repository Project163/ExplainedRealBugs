Feel free to close without ceremony if\nyou do not agree with re-licensing or if it is not possible for other reasons.\nRespond to @cmr with any questions or concerns, or pop over to\n`#rust-offtopic` on IRC to discuss.\n\nYou're receiving this because someone (perhaps the project maintainer)\npublished a crates.io package with the license as \"MIT\" xor \"Apache-2.0\" and\nthe repository field pointing here.\n\nTL;DR the Rust ecosystem is largely Apache-2.0. Being available under that\nlicense is good for interoperation. The MIT license as an add-on can be nice\nfor GPLv2 projects to use your code.\n# Why?\n\nThe MIT license requires reproducing countless copies of the same copyright\nheader with different names in the copyright field, for every MIT library in\nuse. The Apache license does not have this drawback. However, this is not the\nprimary motivation for me creating these issues. The Apache license also has\nprotections from patent trolls and an explicit contribution licensing clause.\nHowever, the Apache license is incompatible with GPLv2. This is why Rust is\ndual-licensed as MIT/Apache (the \"primary\" license being Apache, MIT only for\nGPLv2 compat), and doing so would be wise for this project. This also makes\nthis crate suitable for inclusion and unrestricted sharing in the Rust\nstandard distribution and other projects using dual MIT/Apache, such as my\npersonal ulterior motive, [the Robigalia project](https://robigalia.org).\n\nSome ask, \"Does this really apply to binary redistributions? Does MIT really\nrequire reproducing the whole thing?\" I'm not a lawyer, and I can't give legal\nadvice, but some Google Android apps include open source attributions using\nthis interpretation. [Others also agree with\nit](https://www.quora.com/Does-the-MIT-license-require-attribution-in-a-binary-only-distribution).\nBut, again, the copyright notice redistribution is not the primary motivation\nfor the dual-licensing. It's stronger protections to licensees and better\ninteroperation with the wider Rust ecosystem.\n# How?\n\nTo do this, get explicit approval from each contributor of copyrightable work\n(as not all contributions qualify for copyright, due to not being a \"creative\nwork\", e.g. a typo fix) and then add the following to your README:\n\n```\n## License\n\nLicensed under either of\n\n * Apache License, Version 2.0, ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n * MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nat your option.\n\n### Contribution\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted\nfor inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any\nadditional terms or conditions.\n```\n\nand in your license headers, if you have them, use the following boilerplate\n(based on that used in Rust):\n\n```\n// Copyright 2016 diesel Developers\n//\n// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, <LICENSE-APACHE or\n// http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> or the MIT license <LICENSE-MIT or\n// http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>, at your option. This file may not be\n// copied, modified, or distributed except according to those terms.\n```\n\nIt's commonly asked whether license headers are required. I'm not comfortable\nmaking an official recommendation either way, but the Apache license\nrecommends it in their appendix on how to use the license.\n\nBe sure to add the relevant `LICENSE-{MIT,APACHE}` files. You can copy these\nfrom the [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) repo for a plain-text\nversion.\n\nAnd don't forget to update the `license` metadata in your `Cargo.toml` to:\n\n```\nlicense = \"MIT OR Apache-2.0\"\n```\n\nI'll be going through projects which agree to be relicensed and have approval\nby the necessary contributors and doing this changes, so feel free to leave\nthe heavy lifting to me!\n# Contributor checkoff\n\nTo agree to relicensing, comment with :\n\n```\nI license past and future contributions under the dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license, allowing licensees to chose either at their option.\n```\n\nOr, if you're a contributor, you can check the box in this repo next to your\nname. My scripts will pick this exact phrase up and check your checkbox, but\nI'll come through and manually review this issue later as well.\n- [x] @derekprior\n- [x] @mcasper\n- [x] @mfpiccolo\n- [x] @palango\n- [x] @sgrif\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
