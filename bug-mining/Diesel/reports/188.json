(Your issue will be\r\n  closed if this is not the case)\r\n\r\n## Solving\r\n\r\nDigged into that stacktrace a bit, and found this:\r\nhttps://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/bd349ce9d43de202176e754cedbb2555a76d0f4c/diesel/src/type_impls/option.rs#L84-L101\r\n\r\nwhere in particular, `next_is_null` is documented as making sure that \"the next `count` columns are **all** `NULL`\", hence the  current behaviour.\r\n\r\nNote: Just checking whether **any** of these columns is null is not satisfactory because we still want to deserialize `1, NULL` into `Option<i32, Option<i32>>` as `Some(1, None)` and not just `None`.\r\n\r\n### Whether it should be solved\r\n\r\nClearly in my case whether these booleans are defined doesn't have any meaning if I couldn't join on the `zzz` table, so I'm very happy to not have access to them if just any of these fields is `NULL`, which is why I'm expecting this behaviour.\r\n\r\nI can't think of a scenario where I'd prefer a runtime error: cases where I could unintentionally \"forget\" a field should be covered by the typing after the query: \"Why can't I get the value of this field? Oh it's because it was packed in this `Option`...)","closed_by":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
