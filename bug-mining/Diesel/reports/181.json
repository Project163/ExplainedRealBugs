The problem is not exposed until the developer tries to call belonging_to(Parent2).\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nCreate a model with two parent associations so I can call belonging_to() for either of those parents.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nThe compiler should warn about the incorrect syntax for belongs_to() and advise on the proper syntax. From a usability perspective, allowing multiple associations to be passed to belongs_to() would be an intuitive solution.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\nNothing. The code will compile silently without error (unless belonging_to(Parent2) is called.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel. (Your issue will be\r\n  closed if this is not the case)\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\nA massive thanks to the maintainers and contributors to Diesel. This is a really great ORM.","closed_by":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2091/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
