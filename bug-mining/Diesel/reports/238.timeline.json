, I have looked and there are two things that I want to highlight:\r\n1. I don't see, anymore, cases of composite foreign key creating joinables :)\r\n2. But, I do see joinables being created for simple foreign keys on tables that also have composite foreign keys.\r\n\r\nI actually liked this behaviour better, because we can have a simple and a composite foreign key between two tables AND still have the joinable being created for the simple foreign key. With that said, this might contradict the third bullet point that says that no joinable will be genarated when \"There is more than one foreign key connecting two tables\", as you can see [here](https://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/macro.joinable.html). \r\n\r\nAlso I tested diesel setup on my real project using postgres 11 until 15, and all generated schemas file were the
