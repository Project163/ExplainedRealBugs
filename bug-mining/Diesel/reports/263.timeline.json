Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** 1.75.0\r\n- **Diesel:** master \r\n- **Database:** Postgres\r\n- **Operating System:** Ubuntu\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:** postgres, r2d2\r\n\r\n### Problem description / What are you trying to accomplish?\r\ni'm simply trying to establish a connection to postgres on ubuntu using diesel. everything works fine when i'm on windows, but the moment i switch to ubuntu (either through wsl or my vps) it errors on trying to establish this connection. since it's a c issue i guess it could be a postgres issue but i'm not entirely sure - either way this ONLY occurs when i'm doing it through ubuntu\r\n\r\ni should mention that although i have the r2d2 feature flag, it doesn't work whether or i'm using r2d2 or not (so it's not bc of r2d2)\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n```\r\nGetting connection...\r\nConnection gotten\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n```\r\nGetting connection...\r\ndouble free or corruption (out)\r\ncore dumped\r\n```\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nthis is my code, obv snipped but this is the gist\r\n```rust\r\nstatic DB_URL: Lazy<String> = Lazy::new(|| \r\n    std::env::var(\"DATABASE_URL\").expect(\"Couldn't get database url\")\r\n);\r\n// later\r\nprintln!(\"Getting connection...\");\r\nlet conn = &mut PgConnection::establish(&DB_URL).unwrap(); // core dumped here\r\nprintln!(\"Connection gotten\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) and the [discussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions)\r\n- [X] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel\r\n- [X] This issue can be reproduced without requiring a third party
