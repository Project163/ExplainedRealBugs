you want to report a bug, we added some points below which help us track down the problem faster.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Diesel:** Latest master (b2c58897c39c519a946314bd5b63765d3af56204)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]\r\n#[table_name = \"schema::xxx\"]\r\npub struct WithField<T> {\r\n\tpub field: i32,\r\n\t#[diesel(embed)]\r\n\tpub inner: T,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n```rust \r\nimpl<T, __DB> Selectable<__DB> for WithField<T>\r\nwhere T: Selectable<__DB> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n```rust \r\nimpl<T, __DB> Selectable<__DB> for WithField<T> {}\r\n```\r\n-> fails to compile with \"the trait bound `T: diesel::Selectable<__DB>` is not satisfied\".\r\n\r\n### Solving\r\n\r\nLooks like if a field has `embed`, the `Selectable` derive should add bounds `FieldType: diesel::Selectable<__DB>`, regardless of whether the type is generic or not.\r\n\r\nThis would also allow the `Selectable` derive to interact as expected with manual implementations of `Selectable` on a single backend (non-generic).","closed_by":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
