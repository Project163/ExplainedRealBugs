As a result no row is actually being limited. (code here: https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/v2.0.0/diesel/src/query_builder/upsert/on_conflict_target_decorations.rs#L19)\r\n\r\nNote, the current implementation actually solves a different problem around index predicate but I don't believe that it was the intention of the original issue (https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2430). \r\n\r\n## Details\r\nFor example, looking at the test file (https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/master/diesel_tests/tests/debug/mod.rs#L158), we would potentially get back an sql statement that doesn't work as intended. \r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO \"users\" (\"name\", \"hair_color\") VALUES ($1, $2), ($3, $4) ON CONFLICT (\"hair_color\") WHERE \"users\".\"hair_color\" = $5 DO NOTHING\r\n-- binds ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `WHERE` clause should actually be moved to the end, otherwise it does nothing. \r\n\r\nFor example, according to the postgres documentation (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html), `WHERE` needs to happen after `DO UPDATE SET...`. \r\n```\r\n-- Don't update existing distributors based in a certain ZIP code\r\nINSERT INTO distributors AS d (did, dname) VALUES (8, 'Anvil Distribution')\r\n    ON CONFLICT (did) DO UPDATE\r\n    SET dname = EXCLUDED.dname || ' (formerly ' || d.dname || ')'\r\n    WHERE d.zipcode <> '21201';\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Repro\r\nI tested in a postgresql DB with a trivial example: \r\n```\r\ncreate table test(\r\n    name text primary key,\r\n    version int    \r\n);\r\n\r\ninsert into test values ('a', 5)\r\n\r\n-- this works as intended, row is not updated\r\ninsert into test (\"name\", \"version\") values ('a', 3) on conflict (\"name\") \r\ndo update set \"version\" = excluded.\"version\" where test.\"version\" < 1;\r\n\r\n\r\n-- moving where right after on conflict is wrong. row will be updated regardless what the condition is\r\ninsert into test (\"name\", \"version\") values ('a', 3) on conflict (\"name\") where test.\"version\" < 1\r\ndo update set \"version\" = excluded.\"version\" \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/3330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/3330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
