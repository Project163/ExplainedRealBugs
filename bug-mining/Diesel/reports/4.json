This is the last macro being invoked from our integration tests that needs to go away for 0.1 I intend for this to be `#[can_update=\"users\"]`. This annotation should basically do what the macro does today, including all columns, but should specifically exclude the primary key of the table from the changeset.\n\nAs part of this, I think we should group all our non-derive annotations into a single namespace with each just being a key/value pair. e.g. `#[yaqb(inserable_into(\"users\"), can_update(\"users\"))]`. That change should affect `#[column_name]` as well. That can be a separate PR that pre-dates this change, part of this change, or just not done at all. It's not a 0.1 blocker.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
