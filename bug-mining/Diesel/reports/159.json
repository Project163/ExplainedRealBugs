The new macro would be a function-like procedural macro that should support the following syntaxes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql_function!(fn substr(x: Integer) -> Text);\r\n\r\nsql_function!(fn substr(x: Integer) -> Text, docs);\r\n\r\nsql_function!(\r\n    #[sql_name = \"substr\"]\r\n    fn foo_with_length(x: Integer, length: Integer) -> Text)\r\n);\r\n\r\nsql_function!(\r\n    #[sql_name = \"substr\"]\r\n    fn foo_with_length(x: Integer, length: Integer) -> Text),\r\n    docs\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis macro should also temporarily support the old sql_function syntax until a reasonable point (e.g. next major release).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1604/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
