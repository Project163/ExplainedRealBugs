took a stab at adding a little more documentation in #1548 (as suggested).\r\n\r\nIMO though, the original reporter here has a point in that this goes a little beyond a documentation problem. I've been using Diesel fairly seriously for a few weeks now and it's quite a common pattern to have a compiler protect you from misuse, but to do so in a way that doesn't help give you much of an idea as to what's actually wrong.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably eventually solve the problem, but you do so by changing things until you accidentally get it right, investing lots of time reading documentation, or by cloning Diesel's source code and examining its source and examples in the test suite (I've resorted to this last technique about a hundred times). Compiler errors are often of minimal help.\r\n\r\nI don't really have a suggestion on how to fix this, but I wanted to second the fact that it's a fairly major problem, especially for newcomers to Rust and Diesel who may not be as practiced at unwinding these types of error messages.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/364003192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brandur","id":96890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur","html_url":"https://github.com/brandur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/364624428","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1136#issuecomment-364624428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1136","id":364624428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDYyNDQyOA==","user":{"login":"brandur","id":96890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur","html_url":"https://github.com/brandur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-10T04:11:13Z","updated_at":"2018-02-10T04:11:13Z","body":"Another data point: #1551.
