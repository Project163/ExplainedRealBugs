is still incomplete, but the bulk of the code has been written so I figured I'd get some eyes on it. Right now this just panics instead of returning an error if the user is out of tokens. Still left to do are:\r\n\r\n- The two ignored test cases\r\n- Implementing the actual error type\r\n- Per-user burst rate overrides\r\n- cron job to restrict the table size and clean up stale buckets (I probably won't land this in the initial PR, our users table needs to grow by 2 orders of magnitude for this to really matter -- but I do want to land it as a followup PR since I haven't tested this with cases where now - last_update is greater than a month. It should work fine but I'd rather not have this run against poorly defined semantics)\r\n\r\nI think the limit we'll probably set to start is 1 req/10s with a burst of 30. The error message will tell folks they can either wait for {time until next token} or email us to get the limit increased for them. This is limited per user instead of per ip since rotating your user is harder than rotating your IP. It's stored in the DB since this is only for publishing new crates, which is slow enough already that the DB load of rate limiting there shouldn't matter.\r\n\r\nI needed to update to Rust 1.33 to get `Duration::as_millis` (note: the way we're using this feature causes UB if the rate limit is slower than 1 request per 292471208 years. I assume this is not a problem)\r\nI needed to update to Diesel 1.4.2 to get a fix for https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2017\r\n\r\nThe algorithm used is pretty much the standard token bucket algorithm. It's *slightly* different in how we set `tokens = max(0, tokens - 1) + tokens_to_add` instead of `tokens = max(0, tokens_to_add + 1)`. This is because the usual implementation checks available tokens before subtracting them (and thus never persists if there aren't enough tokens available). Since we're doing this in a single query, and we can *only* return the final, persisted value, we have to change the calculation slightly to make sure that a user who is out of tokens gets `1` back after the rate limit.\r\n\r\nA side effect of all of this is that our token count is actually offset by 1. 0 means the user is not only out of tokens, but that we just tried to take a token and couldn't. 1 means an empty bucket, and a full bucket would technically be burst + 1. The alternative would be -1 meaning the user is actually out of tokens, but since we only ever refill the bucket when we're trying to take a token, we never actually persist a full bucket. I figured a range of 0...burst made more sense than -1..burst.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/1681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/1681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2344909844,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNDQ5MDk4NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/2344909844","actor":{"login":"pietgeursen","id":10556538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTU2NTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10556538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen","html_url":"https://github.com/pietgeursen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pietgeursen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"747b1ff17031021c518bbe87826f510e7cb149ec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pietgeursen/diesel/commits/747b1ff17031021c518bbe87826f510e7cb149ec","created_at":"2019-05-16T00:03:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2378921314,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNzg5MjEzMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/2378921314","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"676efab3b3a57ecc8aaae498c4cac2f8945c6ad2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sgrif/crates.io/commits/676efab3b3a57ecc8aaae498c4cac2f8945c6ad2","created_at":"2019-05-30T18:25:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2378924292,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNzg5MjQyOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/2378924292","actor":{"login":"bors","id":3372342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors","html_url":"https://github.com/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e71d82a10b0df2e0664cc2b19df347d89347d2b7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/crates.io/commits/e71d82a10b0df2e0664cc2b19df347d89347d2b7","created_at":"2019-05-30T18:26:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2378927317,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNzg5MjczMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/2378927317","actor":{"login":"bors","id":3372342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzIzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors","html_url":"https://github.com/bors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bors/starred{/o

In addition to this [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues), you can also talk to Diesel maintainers and users on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** rustc 1.36.0 (a53f9df32 2019-07-03)\r\n- **Diesel:** latest master (0cacfa080183076669112a5ccb192d9c30b8ac15)\r\n- **Database:** psql (11.1, server 11.4 (Debian 11.4-1.pgdg90+1))\r\n- **Operating System** Debian 11.4-1.pgdg90+1\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:** postgres\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\n\r\nMissing parentheses around equality operator lead to malformed SQL queries in the best case and wrong SQL queries silently returning incorrect results in the worst case.\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nBuild a query which corresponds to something like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (1 > 0) = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nTranslating this to diesel, the code will look like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nnumbers.select((n.gt(0)).eq(true));\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull runnable test can be found in my `operator-precedence-bug` branch of diesel. Here is the full test https://github.com/DNNX/diesel/compare/master...operator-precedence-bug which can be run with `(cd diesel_tests && cargo test --features \"postgres\" --no-default-features expressions::test_operator_precedence)`.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nGreen test.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  diesel git:(operator-precedence-bug) ✗ (cd diesel_tests && cargo test --features \"postgres\" --no-default-features expressions::test_operator_precedence)\r\n   Compiling diesel_tests v0.1.0 (/Users/dnnx/work/diesel/diesel_tests)\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 12.26s\r\n     Running /Users/dnnx/work/diesel/target/debug/deps/integration_tests-514980afda54a7bd\r\n\r\nrunning 1 test\r\ntest expressions::test_operator_precedence ...

Mysql is less strict about queries, so it parses things like `select 2=2=2=2` just fine, whereas Postgres rejects such queries.\r\n\r\nI tried to fix the bug myself, but I don't even know where to start. I think adding parentheses around every operator might be a solution, but there's one subtle issue with it: diesel also uses `eq` to generate `SET` part of the `UPDATE` statements - and there having parentheses around `x = <expr>` in `UPDATE foo SET x = <expr>` will be a problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease include as much of your codebase as needed to reproduce the error.  If the relevant files are large, please consider linking to a public repository or a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).\r\n\r\nPlease post as much of your database schema as necessary. If you are using `infer_schema!`, you can use `diesel print-schema` and post the relevant parts from that.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
