you want to report a bug, we added some points below you can fill out. If you want to request a feature, feel free to remove all the irrelevant text. In addition to this [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues), you can also talk to Diesel maintainers and users on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust: 1.48.0**\r\n- **Diesel: v1.4.5**\r\n- **Diesel_Migrations: v1.4.0**\r\n- **Database: SQLite**\r\n- **Operating System: Windows 10**\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel: default**\r\n- **diesel_migrations: default**\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\nHaving a simple `README.md` file in the migrations directory causes the `embed_migrations!` macro to fail compilation.\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\nJust general use of the `embed_migrations!` macro. I added a `README.md` to the migrations directory to document what it was for.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected behaviour?\r\nDiesel would recognize `README.md` is not a directory, and ignore it.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\nDiesel assumes `README.md` is a directory and attempts to access `up.sql` within it, which of course fails.\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: couldn't read \\\\?\\C:\\Users\\Zacc\\rust\\open_dat\\migrations\\README.md\\up.sql: The system cannot find the path specified. (os error 3)\r\n --> src\\db\\mod.rs:6:1\r\n  |\r\n6 | diesel_migrations::embed_migrations!(\"migrations\");\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\r\n\r\nerror: aborting due to previous error\r\n\r\nerror: could not compile `open_dat`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\nNo, just this.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nThe issue can be reproduced with this snippet of code and a migrations directory with a `README.md` file in it:\r\n```rust\r\n#[macro_use]\r\nextern crate diesel_migrations;\r\n\r\ndiesel_migrations::embed_migrations!(\"migrations\");\r\n\r\nfn main() {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeleting the `README.md` file from the directory immediately solves the problem, but this is not a desired solution and feels like avoiding the problem rather than fixing it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues. - *#140 and #141 are relevant, but seem to be focused on files within the sub-directories of the migrations dir*\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel. (Your issue will be\r\n  closed if this is not the case) - *tested on the latest releases of both stable and nightly*\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your submission!
