story long -\r\n\r\nAt some point bindgen started outputting macro-like constants, and `libsqlite3-sys` was \"double exporting\" a bunch of constants that we had previously included manually (see jgallagher/rusqlite#252). 0.7.2 removed the manual constants, instead relying on the bindgen-generated ones.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made a mistake here - there were manual constants (like the three in the diesel error above) that are newer than SQLite 3.6.8 (the default bindgen bindings chosen if you don't select an explicitly newer version of `libsqlite3-sys`). The removal of the manual constants means any users of constants that were added after SQLite 3.6.8 just got an unexpected breaking change - sorry about that!\r\n\r\nI'm taking @killercup's suggestion and doing two things:\r\n\r\n* Yanked libsqlite3-sys 0.7.2 (already done a few hours ago)\r\n* Publishing libsqlite3-sys 0.8.0 that includes a feature requiring a SQLite at least as new as 3.7.16, which is when these constraint constants were added.\r\n\r\nThe fix to use 0.7.1 works as long as you're linking against SQLite 3.7.16 or newer, but the \"right\" fix will be to use 0.8.0 with the `min_sqlite_version_3_7_16` feature enabled.

This should fix this issue for now. Can you confirm this, @SergioBenitez?\r\n\r\nUpdating our dependency on libsqlite3-sys to a version >0.7 is a breaking change to diesel, especially as this is a system lib that can only be linked once. So, this will happen with the 0.13 release at the earliest.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if what minimum version of sqlite we require, but 3.7.16 was release on 2013-03-18, so I'm pretty sure it's not a problem to require that.
