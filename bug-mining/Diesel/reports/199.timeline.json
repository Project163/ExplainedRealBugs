We need to decide how to handle group by clauses in general for `BoxableExpression`. There are several potential solutions here:\n- Make `BoxableExpression` generic over the group by clause\n- Forbid the usage in queries containing a group by clause\n- Restrict `BoxableExpression` to be basically `NonAggregate`\n- possible other things I've forgot about.\n\nIts an area where someone needs to do some experimentation which solution would have which implications and what is even possible to implement.\n\nBeside of that: The next major release is 2.0, so it's to break existing code in cases where it is needed. If we decide to leave the current workaround in place we should add a note to the changelog/upgrade guide.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/615899818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3247960325,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMyNDc5NjAzMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/3247960325","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18T16:33:41Z","milestone":{"title":"2.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/615910387","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2368#issuecomment-615910387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2368","id":615910387,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTkxMDM4Nw==","user":{"login":"Ten0","id":9094255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTQyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9094255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0","html_url":"https://github.com/Ten0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ten0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-18T17:42:48Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T17:42:48Z","body":"Oh right I missed that mention on second read because it was not listed in \"User impact\".
