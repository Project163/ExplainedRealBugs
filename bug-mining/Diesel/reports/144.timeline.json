I've been thinking about for a while is that we need to be careful about data integrity with API calls that are susceptible to [time of check to time of use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use) errors. There are a few ways to address this depending on the situation. An article appeared on Hacker News today ([PostgreSQL anti-patterns: read-modify-write cycles](http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-anti-patterns-read-modify-write-cycles/)) that covers this problem and the potential solutions (and luckily for us, using PostgreSQL for its examples.) A while back I also opened an issue for [transaction isolation support in Diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/408) that will help us with this. This isn't an issue that can be fixed with a PR, per se, so let's just use this as a meta-issue for tracking TOCTTOU errors we find in Ruma's code, and as a reminder to think about this when implementing database logic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruma/homeserver/issues/132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruma/homeserver/issues/132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-16T19:45:41Z","updated_at":"2017-12-16T19:45:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1356","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1356/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1356/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1356/events","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1356","id":279909191,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzk5MDkxOTE=","number":1356,"title":"Support

adds support for all options which can be given to `SET\r\nTRANSACTION`. We only expose an API for this when opening the\r\ntransaction though, as `SET TRANSACTION` errors unless it's the first\r\nquery run after opening the transaction.\r\n\r\nMost of the tests are really just there to make sure the code compiles\r\nand generates valid SQL. Seeing *a* usage example is still worth having,\r\nbut I don't think we can effectively demonstrate/test the differences\r\nbetween isolation levels in a reasonable manner.\r\n\r\nThis lays some groundwork that will also be used by #1356, but I haven't\r\nimplemented SQLite support yet. The APIs for this will be backend\r\nspecific, not trait based.\r\n\r\nFixes
