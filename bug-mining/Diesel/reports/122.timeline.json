gets rid of `IntoInsertStatement`, and turns `BatchInsertStatement`\r\ninto the only visible type for constructing queries. In its\r\nimplementations of `LoadDsl` and `ExecuteDsl`, it ends up constructing\r\n`InsertStatement` which is what actually performs the execution.\r\n\r\nThe names are now super poor and misleading. The reason I've opted not\r\nto rename them in this commit is that I actually think I'm going to end\r\nup getting rid of `BatchInsertStatement` entirely, and only have\r\n`InsertStatement`. If we don't end up going that route, I'm going to\r\nrename `InsertStatement` to `ExecutableInsertStatement` and rename\r\n`BatchInsertStatement` to just `InsertStatement`.\r\n\r\nAside from simplifying our codebase, this change also makes sure that\r\nall insert statements constructed will include the 0-row checking case.\r\nI think we can eventually just move this into the `QueryFragment` impl\r\nby doing `SELECT returning_clause FROM table WHERE 1=0`. This would mean\r\nthe only thing we have to special case is SQLite batch insert.\r\n\r\nFixes #797","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1253548058,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyNTM1NDgwNTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/1253548058","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"349aa4fc11df521c947b38ebdc2841204a70f586","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/349aa4fc11df521c947b38ebdc2841204a70f586","created_at":"2017-09-18T14:22:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1253580147,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTI1MzU4MDE0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/1253580147","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"349aa4fc11df521c947b38ebdc2841204a70f586","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/349aa4fc11df521c947b38ebdc2841204a70f586","created_at":"2017-09-18T14:37:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
