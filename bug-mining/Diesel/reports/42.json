When attempting to use `itry!` on a bit of code which returns an error containing a `diesel::result::Error` I get a nasty warning about implementing `Send` for an this error:\n\n```\n<iron macros>:7:1: 7:26 error: the trait `core::marker::Send` is not implemented for the type `std::error::Error + 'static` [E0277]\n<iron macros>:7 $ crate:: IronError:: new ( err , $ modifier ) ) } )\n                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<iron macros>:2:1: 2:61 note: in this expansion of itry!
