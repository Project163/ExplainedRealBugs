now there is no support for the `Numeric` type at all on SQLite\r\n(since SQLite has no type that maps to it). This is a problem that we\r\nneed to fix later (probably by just treating it as an alias for\r\n`Double` there).\r\n\r\nThe CFG attrs are really funky here. This is because tests for the main\r\ncrate run with multiple backends enabled, but the doctests need to run\r\nagainst a single backend, and they have the equivalent to this:\r\n\r\n    #[cfg(feature = \"postgres\")]\r\n    type DB = Pg;\r\n\r\n    #[cfg(all(not(feature = \"postgres\"), feature = \"sqlite\"))]\r\n    type DB = Sqlite;\r\n\r\n    #[cfg(all(not(any(feature = \"postgres\", feature = \"sqlite\")), feature = \"mysql\"))]\r\n    type DB = Mysql;\r\n\r\nIn other words, the doctests run against the first of [\"pg\", \"sqlite\",\r\n\"mysql\"] that is enabled, in that order... So this test needs to run if\r\npg is enabled (overrides SQLite) or SQLite is not enabled (so we must be\r\nrunning on a backend that will pass).\r\n\r\nFixes #841 since this is really the last thing there that isn't fixed. I\r\nwill open a separate issue for the SQLite problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1408/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1391086275,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTM5MTA4NjI3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/1391086275","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-12-17T14:20:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
