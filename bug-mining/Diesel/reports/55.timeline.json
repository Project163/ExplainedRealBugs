Perhaps we should write an `impl<TZ> ToSql<Timestamp, Pg> for DateTime<TZ>` and `impl FromSql<Timestamp, Pg> for DateTime<UTC>`, where the `ToSql` impl converts to UTC. I'm concerned this implies more guarantees than exist though, as the database does not contain TZ information on a normal `timestamp` type column.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":759993229,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc1OTk5MzIyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/759993229","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2b1f748a1f15c090ffe61bb14cb9567764638e43","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/2b1f748a1f15c090ffe61bb14cb9567764638e43","created_at":"2016-08-18T14:34:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":759997093,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc1OTk5NzA5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/759997093","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b75489806a4aa59e4df6f32efcc6ec095bef8c30","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/b75489806a4aa59e4df6f32efcc6ec095bef8c30","created_at":"2016-08-18T14:36:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-18T14:37:12Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T14:37:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/409","id":171916933,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0ODE4MjcxMDc=","number":409,"title":"Add

adds support for the `timestamp with time zone` type. This is part\nof the SQL standard, but not supported explicitly by SQLite as far as I\ncan tell. As such I've made it a PG specific type for now.\n\ntimestamp with time zone does not actually mean that a time zone is\nstored. It instead means that when dealing with strings, Postgres will\nno longer ignore the time zone portion. It will convert the time zone to\nUTC for storage. When transmitted as text, it will be converted to the\ndatabase's local time zone. When transmitted as binary, it will be sent\nas UTC.\n\nAs such, I've provided `ToSql` implementations for basically all flavors\nof `DateTime`, but I've only provided a `FromSql` implementation for\n`DateTime<UTC>` and `NaiveDateTime`. I have not provided any\nimplementation for `std::time::SystemTime`, as it implies local time\nzone for the machine and we do not have the tools to handle the\nconversion in the standard
