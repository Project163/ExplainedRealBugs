is part of the restructuring required to give a reasonable solution\nto #360. In the case of PG, we hold onto the result pointer, and expose\nall of the most commonly relevant fields that can be returned from\n`PQresultErrorField`. Of the fields we've chosen to expose, only the\nprimary message is guaranteed to be present.\n\nAs per libpq's documentation, no assumptions can be made about when any\nother fields will or will not be present, so they unconditionally return\nan option, instead of exposing a separate API for different error types\nwhere we expect certain fields to always be present.\n\nThis works out with SQLite pretty well as well, since SQLite doesn't\nactually give any additional information beyond the error code and\n\"extended error code\". I think it might be possible for us to improve\nthe error message by using `sqlite3_errmsg` instead of `sqlite3_errstr`,\nbut that needs further exploration. Either way, short of parsing the\nerror message, we won't be able to populate any of the other fields so\nwe continue to return a string.\n\nThis restructuring has the side effect of encoding the fix for the leak\nresolved by #361 in the type system, which should help to ensure that\nit causes no further problems in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/228818448","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/360#issuecomment-228818448","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/360","id":228818448,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODgxODQ0OA==","user":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T17:39:54Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T17:40:06Z","body":"Anyone have opinions on\n\n``` rust\nenum Error {\n    DatabaseError(Box<DatabaseErrorInformation>),\n    UniqueConstraintViolation(Box<DatabaseErrorInformation>),\n    ForeignKeyViolation(Box<DatabaseErrorInformation>),\n    InvalidTransactionState(Box<DatabaseErrorInformation>),\n    // Rest of error variants, which is not related to the database specifically\n}\n```\n\nvs.\n\n``` rust\nenum Error {\n    DatabaseError(DatabaseErrorKind, Box<DatabaseErrorInformation>),\n    // Rest of error variants, which is not related to the database specifically\n}\n\nenum DatabaseErrorKind {\n    UniqueConstraintViolation,\n    ForeignKeyViolation,\n    InvalidTransactionState,\n    #[doc(hidden)]\n    __Unknown, // Match against _ instead, more variants may be added in the future\n}\n```\n\nvs.\n\n``` rust\nenum Error {\n    DatabaseError(DatabaseErrorKind, Box<DatabaseErrorInformation>),\n    // Rest of error variants, which is not related to the database specifically\n}\n\nenum DatabaseErrorKind {\n    ConstraintViolation(ConstraintKind),\n    InvalidTransactionState,\n    #[doc(hidden)]\n    __Unknown, // Match against _ instead, more variants may be added in the future\n}\n\nenum ConstraintKind {\n    Integrity,\n    Restrict,\n    NotNull,\n    ForeignKey,\n    Unique,\n    Check,\n    Exclusion,\n}\n```\n\nSo the difference between matching: `UniqueConstraintViolation(error)`, `DatabaseError(UniqueConstraintViolation, error)`, or `DatabaseError(ConstraintViolation(Unique), error)`. The first one is definitely more concise, but the second one feels better structured internally. The third one is quite verbose (especially when you include the additional imports), but it is the most flexible in that it would allow users to for example handle any constraint violation without

On SQLite there is no way to get the specific constraint that failed.\n\nEDIT: Also you can't pattern match on those specifics (other than with a guard). I _really_ wanted to try to make that happen, but there's no way without adding a lifetime to the error enum, since it'd need to be an &'a str, and it'd be ugly to pattern match on anyway since the variant would have to contain the result, etc. Only way around either one is to use a `String`, and you can't pattern match

lays the groundwork for a more robust error handling story, but to\nstart we are only handling `UniqueViolation` specifically. SQLite\nseparates primary key violations from unique constraints, but I've opted\nto group them together.\n\nDue to how PG handles errors, we will only know one of the constraints\nthat was violated (if more than one was violated), and you can only get\nthe constraint name, not the column name (in the single column case).\nSQLite provides none of this information, and the error message would\nhave to be parsed to determine which constraint failed.\n\nUltimately I think all of this is fine, as you rarely are expecting more\nthan exactly one constraint to fail in a given query.\n\nFixes #360\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":711183047,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDcxMTE4MzA0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/711183047","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ebf98c07ca45847f54cdadbaffb26a203fe5c197","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/ebf98c07ca45847f54cdadbaffb26a203fe5c197","created_at":"2016-07-02T12:36:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":711183059,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzExMTgzMDU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/711183059","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-07-02T12:36:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
