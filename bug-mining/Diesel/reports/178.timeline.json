For example, the following migration:\r\n\r\n**up.sql**\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1 FROM does_not_exist;\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuted with:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nembedded_migrations::run_with_output(&conn, &mut std::io::stdout()).expect(\"unable to migrate\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill result in the following output:\r\n\r\n> Running migration 20190221123919\r\n> thread 'main' panicked at 'unable to migrate: MigrationError(IoError(Custom { kind: Other, error: StringError(\"formatter error\") }))', src/libcore/result.rs:997:5\r\n> note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.\r\n> Executing migration script\r\n\r\nWhat SHOULD be shown is something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n> thread 'main' panicked at 'unable to migrate: QueryError(DatabaseError(__Unknown, \"relation \\\"does_not_exist\\\" does not exist\"))', src/libcore/result.rs:997:5\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the reason is very simple.

using embedded migrations, all error information is currently lost due to a mysterious `formatting error` replacing the actual error. The error itself is not important, as long as it happens within the migration run. For example, the following migration:\r\n\r\n**up.sql**\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1 FROM does_not_exist;\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuted with:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nembedded_migrations::run_with_output(&conn, &mut std::io::stdout()).expect(\"unable to migrate\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill result in the following output:\r\n\r\n> Running migration 20190221123919\r\n> thread 'main' panicked at 'unable to migrate: MigrationError(IoError(Custom { kind: Other, error: StringError(\"formatter error\") }))', src/libcore/result.rs:997:5\r\n> note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.\r\n> Executing migration script\r\n\r\nWhat SHOULD be shown is something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n> thread 'main' panicked at 'unable to migrate: QueryError(DatabaseError(__Unknown, \"relation \\\"does_not_exist\\\" does not exist\"))', src/libcore/result.rs:997:5\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the reason is very simple. Upon encountering an error, diesel attempts to display the filename of the failed migration:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/03ec1d96ffa8a4f957ba6dc9bd5ab5b556a96d12/diesel_migrations/migrations_internals/src/lib.rs#L337-L344\r\n\r\nSince the embedded migration's `impl Migration` is left without a `file_path()` implementation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/03ec1d96ffa8a4f957ba6dc9bd5ab5b556a96d12/diesel_migrations/migrations_macros/src/embed_migrations.rs#L37-L49\r\n\r\n...  it returns the default `None`, which then triggers the formatting error here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/03ec1d96ffa8a4f957ba6dc9bd5ab5b556a96d12/diesel_migrations/migrations_internals/src/migration.rs#L49-L52\r\n\r\nAnd since the `writeln!()` for the error message uses `?`, the formatting error from above ends up replacing the original error entirely.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a fake path based on the version identifier that lets things proceed as usual while providing useful information.\r\n\r\nFixes #1977 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1993/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/466699816","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1977#issuecomment-466699816","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1977","id":466699816,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NjY5OTgxNg==","user":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-23T21:46:00Z","updated_at":"2019-02-23T21:46:00Z","body":"Your explanation of the issue makes sense, but I do not think that pretending an embedded migration has a file path is the right solution.
