provides a more lightweight API for inserts that mirrors what is\r\npossible with `.set` for updates. The implementation provided ensures\r\nthat all elements within the tuple are valid for the same table, and\r\nthat there's no funkiness like sticking an upsert value in there.\r\n(Secret way to break Diesel -- It will totally allow you to stick a\r\n`Vec` in there, and will generate invalid SQL as a result. We should fix\r\nthat one eventually, but it's pretty low priority)\r\n\r\nOne thing I would also like to allow is to allow mixing ad-hoc values\r\nand `Insertable` structs. (See 10374a5026bcab2202f7f67f057493c4636d547b\r\nfor rationale). I tried a naive approach where I moved the parens out\r\nfrom the `InsertValues` impl on tuples, and into `InsertStatement`, but\r\nthat breaks PG upsert, so I'll need to spend more time on it. I've left\r\nthe test cases for that in place, but I will defer actually making them\r\npass for a later PR in order to keep the PR size and scope reasonable.\r\n\r\nI expected to need more tests/compile-tests, but what's included here\r\nfelt like it pretty exhaustively tests everything.\r\n\r\nFixes

are two main things that got me thinking about this change. The first is [this code](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/1165/files#diff-0f3c021dc67b888eef8a6619689208cbR19). It's a papercut, but I don't like the fact that if you get the argument to `insert` wrong, the message is going to be that you passed the wrong number of arguments to `into`. Maybe this isn't a big deal (I don't think it's ever come up in gitter), but it's a paper cut I'd like to avoid, and I think it will be easier to run into once #789 is done.\r\n\r\nThe second is that I've been thinking about an API to represent `INSERT INTO table (column_list) SELECT ...`. The best idea I've seen based on our current API is `insert(select_statement).into(column_list)`, but that feels a little implicit to me. If we changed the insert API, I could see something like `insert_into(table).columns(column_list).values(select_statement)` or `insert_into(table).from_select(column_list, select_statement)` being much more
