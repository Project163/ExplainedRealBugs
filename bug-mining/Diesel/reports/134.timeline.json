We are seeking feedback\r\n\r\nThe core team hasn't decided if we actually want to go forward with this proposal. We are seeking feedback from the community on their thoughts. The purpose of this PR is to provide a place to centralize discussion, and provide the ability for people to try out the proposal against their code bases. We would like to hear from you on how much this change impacts your codebase, how painful migrating to this would be, and whether you'd find this confusing as a newcomer.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes any functions which could previously take a tuple as an argument to take an hlist instead. The TL;DR is that the rule of thumb for \"things that are separated by a comma in SQL are represented as _ in diesel\" changes from \"a tuple\" to \"an hlist\". This means that `(x, y)` changes to `hlist!(x, y)` (we may land on a different name, see the *Unanswered Questions* section below).\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar, \"hlist\" is short for \"heterogeneous list\". It is essentially a singly linked list where each element is able to be of a different type. The list encodes this in its own type. It is effectively the same as a bunch of nested pairs. e.g. `Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)))` is more-or-less the same as `(1, (2, 3))` or `(1, (2, (3, ())))`.\r\n\r\nThe specific functions that change are [`query.select`](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/prelude/trait.SelectDsl.html#tymethod.select), [`query.order`](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/prelude/trait.OrderDsl.html#tymethod.order), and [`update(table).set(...)`](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/query_builder/update_statement/struct.IncompleteUpdateStatement.html#method.set) when updating multiple columns but not using a struct that has `#[derive(AsChangeset)]`.\r\n\r\nA less visible API that is changed is the type argument to the [`sql`](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/expression/dsl/fn.sql.html) function. However, this function may be deprecated and removed before 1.0 in favor of an escape hatch API that is untyped (see #650).\r\n\r\nThis also affects implementations of [`Queryable`](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/query_source/trait.Queryable.html), [`AsChangeset`](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/query_builder/trait.AsChangeset.html), and [`Insertable`](http://docs.diesel.rs/diesel/prelude/trait.Insertable.html). However, these are usually derived rather than implemented manually (with the possible exception of `Queryable`).\r\n\r\nThis does not affect the ability to use tuples in a *return type* position. This means that doing `.load::<(A, B)>` will still work, and associations still work in terms of tuples. This is purely due to how likely this change is to affect the average user. An application can be doing extremely complex queries, and still never call `.select` or `.order` explicitly with more than one argument. However, any time a join is done, or associations are loaded, tuples get involved in a much more visible fashion. Associations in particular are designed to work around `Iterator::zip` and `Iterator::unzip`, which is only feasible if they work on tuples.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while code that is passing a tuple can be changed to pass an hlist simply by putting `hlist!` in front of it, the story is more involved for code working with tuples. Hlists cannot simply be indexed like tuples can, they have to instead be destructured. This is acceptable for us to do internally, but not something I'd like to impose on every user of the library.\r\n\r\n## What this gets us\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the code is simpler, and our compile time goes down. To implement a trait for an arbitrarily sized hlist, you need to provide two impls: `Cons<T, U> where T: SomeTrait, U: SomeTrait` and `Nil`. (In some places we do `Cons<T, Cons<U, Tail>>` and `Cons<T, Nil>` instead when we have things like comma separation to worry about).\r\n\r\nImplementing code for an arbitrary sized tuple is much harder. You basically have to write the impls as a macro, and invoke it for whatever size you want to support. This is what the standard library does for traits like `PartialEq` (which aren't implemented on tuples larger than 12 elements). This change removes *half* of the code in the main crate (as measured by `cargo rustc -- -Zunstable-options --pretty=expanded | wc -l`), and decreases compile times by 70% (measured by `touch src/lib.rs && cargo build`). Moving this code out of macros and into regular rust will also make it much easier for new contributors to understand.\r\n\r\nThis may also open the door for several future improvements that would not be possible with tuples. Several blanket impls that we want to write are impossible because they overlap with the impls for tuples. At the moment most of them overlap with hlists as well, but specialization and/or future improvements to specialization are easier to apply to hlists than tuples.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I think that this change will eventually allow us to remove the requirements that struct order match the column order (in cases where your struct is one-to-one with a table), and also remove the requirement that you must have a field for your struct for every member of the select statement. Right now we would be unable to write the impls required to make that happen, but several of the possibilities being discussed for specialization would allow us to make that happen. If you're interested in the details of that, I've written them up [here](https://gist.github.com/sgrif/213e7453bc5518596c52cf99b1b80fd7).\r\n\r\nYou may notice that some of these gains are all assuming speculative future enhancements to the language. Why not wait until they actually happen to make this change? Ultimately we want to release 1.0 before those changes are likely to happen. If we want to avoid breaking backwards compatibility, we need to leave the door open to take advantage of those changes when they happen. Even if we limit the \"wins\" to the more accessible code and improved compile times, I do think it's still worth it.\r\n\r\n## Why didn't we use an existing library for this?\r\n\r\nUltimately if we make this change, hlists become a very fundamental part of people interacting with Diesel, which makes me uncomfortable leaving that in the hands of another crate unless it's already well established within the community. There also isn't a crate that is maintained and *just* does hlists. Having a type which is local to Diesel is useful for us from a coherence point of view.\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe most obvious drawback is that we take tuples instead of hlists. Tuples are in the standard library. hlists aren't. That said, I don't know that people are actually discovering that they can pass tuples on their own. Two common questions in gitter are \"how do I order by multiple things\", and \"how do I update multiple columns without using a struct\". We can fix that by giving some more up front examples of those cases, but if people aren't finding tuples without being shown, hlists aren't really any worse. They're just equally bad. Ultimately what we really want is a variadic function, but that's not going to happen.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this will make some of our scary type signatures more scary. `diesel::hlist::Cons<Foo, diesel::hlist::Cons<Bar, diesel::hlist::Nil>>` is harder to read than `(Foo, Bar)`. That said, the type would really only show up in errors that were already incomprehensible. Nobody is actually making sense of `SelectStatement<five, terminal, windows, of, types>` other than the core team when people paste them in gitter asking for help. Our goal has been to structure things so that the types don't get dumped in error messages, and will continue to be.\r\n\r\nSome of our error messages got... well I'm not sure if it's worse, or better. For example, the error for the table having one more column than the struct has changed from `(i32, String, String): FromSqlRow<(Integer, Text, Text, Double)> failed` to `Nil: FromSqlRow<Cons<Double, Nil>> failed`. One could argue that without reading the documentation, a person might actually figure out what's going on from the first error message, but not from the second. In practice I'm not sure that's true though, and it's a lot easier to *document* that `Nil: FromSqlRow` means you have more columns on the table than the struct than it is for us to say \"hey make sure you count the tuple elements if you see an error about a tuple and another tuple\".\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nWe could also keep this change entirely internal, provide an `IntoHlist` trait, and implement that for tuples of arbitrary sizes. This is a bad alternative for 2 reasons. First, it will bring back the \"we need to implement things for *really* large tuples\" problem, and hurt compile times. Second, since these functions can also take just one argument, we will need to brute force that trait for a lot of types, including some which are potentially inconvenient to do so. Specialization may improve that situation when it stabilizes.\r\n\r\n## Unanswered Questions\r\n\r\nNaming. `hlist!` could conflict with other libraries, so we'd want to have the canonical name be `diesel_hlist!` (though I want to keep the short variant. People can choose not to import the short version if they don't want to). However, do we actually want to make the fact that we're using hlists apparent? Would a name like `args!` or `columns!` make more sense?\r\n\r\n## How we teach this\r\n\r\nWe should almost certainly add an example in the getting started guide which demonstrates how hlists work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/747/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-15T20:48:49Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T20:48:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/801","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/801/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/801/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/801/events","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/801","id":214365040,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTEwODI2NDQy","number":801,"title":"Allow

has always been a bit clunky to use if you wanted to write a whole\r\nquery with it. You have to specify the SQL type of the query, which also\r\nmeans you have to list every column out explicitly to ensure they're in\r\nthe expected order.\r\n\r\nThis adds a replacement API that more geared towards writing complete\r\nqueries. There are two notable differences. The first is that the SQL\r\ntype of each field is specified during deserialization, not when the\r\nquery is constructed. The types are never checked anyway (other than to\r\nmake sure the deserialization is valid), so it makes sense to defer this\r\nto a place where we can derive it.\r\n\r\nThe second difference is that columns are deserialized by name, not by\r\nindex. This has all of the gotchas that are associated with doing that\r\nwith other libraries (name conflicts between tables, etc)\r\n\r\nI had originally planned on having `NamedRow::get` optionally also take\r\na table name. However, PG gives you the OID not the name, so we'd need\r\nto do another query to get the table name. SQLite only gives you the\r\ntable/column name if compiled with a flag to enable it, which the system\r\nsqlite3 on mac does not.\r\n\r\nFor those two reasons, I've opted to use the column name alone. This\r\nmeans that the derived `QueryableByName` is unlikely to be usable with\r\njoins, but that's a price we'll have to pay for now.\r\n\r\nI'd like to expand the number of cases that our derive impl can handle\r\n(e.g. allow providing a sql type in addition to a column name), but this\r\nis a good bare minimum place to start.\r\n\r\nFixes
