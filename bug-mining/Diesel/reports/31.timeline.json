previous infrastructure relied on the ability to use the `DEFAULT`\nkeyword for values which were not present. This keyword does not exist\non SQLite. This means that the query:\n\n``` sql\nINSERT INTO users (name, hair_color) VALUES ('Tess', DEFAULT)\n```\n\nneeds to instead be written as\n\n``` sql\nINSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Tess')\n```\n\nThis does not work for batch inserts, where some of the rows provide\nvalues, but others want the defaults. There is no way to express this in\na single query using SQLite. Because of this, we disallowed batch\ninserts for SQLite entirely in 10caf03dd8566977bc63f18ebc784f6b61b99eb4.\nThis issue will be revisted after 0.5 is released.\n\nThere were several changes included in this commit which are\ntangentially related to this change.\n\nWe were able to remove the \"context\" concept from our query builder\nentirely. This was only there to insert the `\"DEFAULT\"` keyword instead\nof a bind param on nulls during insert. It was never something I was\nsuper happy with, and it resulted in allocations that the compiler would\nnever be able to optimize away. With this change, we have a better place\nto handle this.\n\nI've had to alter codegen to specifically reference `Bound` instead of\nusing the `AsExpr` helper which is technically corrent. Without that\nchange, we get some very obscure lifetime errors that I honestly don't\nfully understand. This is either a bug in Rust itself, or some _very_\nobscure interaction with\nhttps://github.com/sgrif/diesel/blob/8a33029/diesel/src/types/impls/mod.rs#L23-L29\nthat I do not understand (I believe it is a bug in Rust, given that it\nonly manifests in `where` clauses. I have been unable to isolate it in a\nplayground link, but I will follow up with the core team tomorrow on\nthis.)\n\nThe changes that were required to the `migrations` module are\nunfortunate, but necessary. Even though SQLite is the _only_ backend\nwhich would not implement `SupportsDefaultKeyword`, I have no way to\nrepresent this in the type system. As such, I can provide no evidence\nthat a tuple of `ColumnInsertValue`s always implements\n`InsertValues<DB>` for all possible `DB`. This can go away once\nspecialization lands in stable.\n\nUltimately we can likely re-implement batch inserts for SQLite in the\nfuture by having it execute one query per row under the hood. As has\nbeen pointed out to me numerous times in other places, since SQLite is\nan embedded databbase, there is no downside to doing 10 queries instead\nof 1 (assuming we're in a transaction so there is no IO cost).\n\nFixes
