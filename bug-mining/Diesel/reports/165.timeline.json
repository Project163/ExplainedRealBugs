hygiene used to ignore module scope, which meant that we could\r\nreference a type from outside our wrapper module even if we didn't\r\nimport it. That is changing in an upcoming version of Rust.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we can't just do either of the recommended solutions\r\n(either adding `use super::*` or changing to use a function instead of a\r\nmodule). `use super::*` doesn't work for types defined inside of a\r\nfunction, and changing ot use a function instead of a module broke our\r\nworkaround to pretend we had `$crate` when we really didn't.\r\n\r\nWith this change, an item named `diesel` must be present at the crate\r\nroot. In the case of Diesel itself, this is just a module, but for all\r\nusers they will now have to put `extern crate diesel` at the crate root.\r\nIt's unlikely folks were renaming it, but we will no longer work if they\r\ndo (the import was already located at the crate root, since you cant do\r\n`#[macro_use] extern crate` anywhere else).\r\n\r\nFixes
