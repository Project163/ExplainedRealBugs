The implementation will need to be a little bit more complex than just `conn.transaction(|| what we have now)`, since savepoints have a non-zero cost so we should only start a transaction if we aren't already inside of one.","closed_by":{"login":"killercup","id":20063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup","html_url":"https://github.com/killercup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/killercup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
