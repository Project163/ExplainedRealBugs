Specifically the following command: `diesel migration --database-url my.db --migration-dir migrations/sqlite list`\r\n\r\nThe `migrations/sqlite` folder contains a folder called `2017-11-11-060348_initial`, which contains only `up.sql` and `down.sql`. `my.db` has had no migrations applied.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nThe command should show the list of available migrations.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n`Invalid migration directory, the directory's name should be <timestamp>_<name_of_migration>, and it should only contain up.sql and down.sql.`","closed_by":{"login":"notryanb","id":9320141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMjAxNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9320141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb","html_url":"https://github.com/notryanb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notryanb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
