However, when inserting it into the table, I got `DatabaseError(NotNullViolation, \"NOT NULL constraint failed: kvs.v\")`. And if I feed set_value a borrowed str, it works as intended.\r\n\r\nI read the doc and the implementation of [`SqliteBindValue`](http://docs.diesel.rs/2.0.x/diesel/sqlite/struct.SqliteBindValue.html) but still don't know what went wrong. Could you please help me with this?\r\n\r\nThe minimal reproduce repo is at https://github.com/PhotonQuantum/diesel-not-null-test.</div>","closed_by":{"login":"pksunkara","id":174703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/174703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara","html_url":"https://github.com/pksunkara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pksunkara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/3425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/3425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
