If you want to request a feature, feel free to remove all the irrelevant text.

I'm pretty sure this is due to the `pragma_foreign_key_list` pseudo-table doesn't expect a `NULL`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/07319d363aff713dbe52914aa2f512431f559864/diesel_infer_schema/infer_schema_internals/src/sqlite.rs#L27-L38\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease include as much of your codebase as needed to reproduce the error.  If the relevant files are large, please consider linking to a public repository or a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).\r\n\r\nPlease post as much of your database schema as necessary. If you are using `infer_schema!`, you can use `diesel print-schema` and post the relevant parts from that.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your submission!
