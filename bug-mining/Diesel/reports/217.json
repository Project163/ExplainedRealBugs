While this isn't a huge issue in general, and the code will build just fine, some CI/CD tooling might break because of this if clippy generates a warning or error regarding this.\r\n\r\nAlso adding `#[allow(clippy::extra_unused_lifetimes)]` above or below that derive will not work, because that is not where the lifetimes are set since they happen within the macro.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** rustc 1.63.0-nightly (9257f5aad 2022-05-21)\r\n- **Cargo:** cargo 1.63.0-nightly (a4c1cd0eb 2022-05-18)\r\n- **Diesel:** 4fe987676e7c465f2fdc116fdf11ba4378e64f9a\r\n- **Database:** postgres, mysql, sqlite\r\n- **Operating System:** Linux\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:** the respective database, nothing else.\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\n\r\nWhen for example using the `getting_started_step_3` example on all the database types running the nightly clippy will generate a warning.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Checking diesel_demo_step_3_sqlite v0.1.0 (/home/mathijs/rust/diesel/examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_3)\r\nwarning: this lifetime isn't used in the impl\r\n   --> examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_3/src/models.rs:12:10\r\n    |\r\n12  | #[derive(Insertable)]\r\n    |          ^^^^^^^^^^ in this derive macro expansion\r\n    |\r\n   ::: /home/mathijs/rust/diesel/diesel_derives/src/lib.rs:403:1\r\n    |\r\n403 | pub fn derive_insertable(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {\r\n    | ----------------------------------------------------------- in this expansion of `#[derive(Insertable)]`\r\n    |\r\n    = note: `#[warn(clippy::extra_unused_lifetimes)]` on by default\r\n    = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#extra_unused_lifetimes\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf i run this on the Vaultwarden codebase it also reports the same for the `AsChangeset` derive.\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nRunning the nightly clippy. I do this once in a while to check newly generated clippy results before they might occur when a new release of rust is generated.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nNo clippy errors from the macro generated code.\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\nClippy errors from the macro generated code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\n\r\nThere are some other clippy errors on the example using both current stable (`cargo 1.61.0 (a028ae4 2022-04-29)`) and nightly clippy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Go to one of the database type examples like `examples/sqlite/getting_started_step_3`\r\n- Run clippy with either stable or nightly `cargo +nightly clippy -- -Z macro-backtrace` or `cargo +stable clippy`\r\n- Check the warnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues)  and the [disussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions)  for similar possible closed issues.\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are unsure if your issue is a duplicate of an existing issue please link the issue in question here\r\n--> \r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
