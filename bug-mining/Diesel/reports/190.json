The issue here is that `x = NULL` in SQL returns `NULL`. I've managed to distill it into the following test case:\n\n``` rust\n#[test]\nfn test_comparing_null() {\n    use diesel::prelude::*;\n    use diesel::select;\n    use diesel::expression::AsExpression;\n    use diesel::types::{Nullable, Integer};\n\n    let query = select(AsExpression::<Nullable<Integer>>::as_expression(None::<i32>).eq(Some(1)));\n    query.get_result::<bool>(&connection()).unwrap();\n}\n```\n\nThe query here is ultimately\n\n``` sql\nSELECT NULL = 1;\n```\n\nThe problem is that the sql type of `Eq<T, U>` is always `Bool`, and so we panic on an \"unexpected null value\" when trying to read it. We need to have the type of `Eq<Nullable<T>, Nullable<U>>` to be `Nullable<Bool>`.\n\nI should also note that this _only_ applies to these sorts of expressions appearing in a select clause. It does not affect us in places like `where` clauses. Also as an aside, in places like where clauses, `NULL` is effectively the same as `false` which is part of why I'm leaning towards the second answer.\n\nThere are basically two answers here:\n- We change the type of the expression to be `Nullable<Bool>` where appropriate. This will almost certainly require specialization, and I'm not actually sure that specialization as proposed today will suffice.\n- We have the `impl FromSql<Bool> for bool` treat `NULL` as `false`. I'm actually fine with this, if we can be sure that infix predicates which would otherwise return a boolean are the **only** case where null can bubble up like this. It should be noted that this problem applies to all infix predicates, not just `=`. This also applies to `>` and `AND` for example.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
