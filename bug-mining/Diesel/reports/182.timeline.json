There it's not possible to select such a non nullable field. (To select that field you need to use `column.nullable()` instead)\r\n* There seems to be a bug as soon as more than one join is involved, then the not nullable field is also accepted.\r\n\r\nSo basically that code above should result in a compiler error but it doesen't. To workaround the runtime error: just call `.nullable()` on each column coming from the table of the left join.

looks like something along those lines may actually work. Ultimately what we need is for `impl SelectableExpression<Join<Left, Right, Inner>> for column` to have `where column: SelectableExpression<Left>` *or* `where column: SelectableExpression<Right>`. Since that can only be true for one of those two types today, we can have another trait which selects either `Left` or `Right` based on which one the table appears in. E.g. something like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Select<Left, Right> for (Once, Never) {\r\n    type Selection = Left;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Select<Left, Right> for (Never, Once) {\r\n    type Selection = Right;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<Left, Right> SelectableExpression<Join<Left, Right, Inner>> for Column\r\nwhere\r\n    Left: AppearsInFromClause<table>,\r\n    Right: AppearsInFromClause<table>,\r\n    (Left::Count, Right::Count): Select<Left, Right>,\r\n    Self: SelectableExpression<\r\n         <(Left::Count, Right::Count) as Select<Left, Right>>::Selection,\r\n    >,\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat with the change in my earlier comment fixes the bug, but surfaces a new problem. Our `impl SelectableExpression<Join<Left, Right, Kind>> for Nullable<T>` actually relies on this bug, so I'll have to figure out a new way to make that work. But I think it's possible.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/562208306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/562224975","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2001#issuecomment-562224975","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2001","id":562224975,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjIyNDk3NQ==","user":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T17:14:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T17:14:39Z","body":"PR

multiple joins are nested together, the resulting type is\r\nessentially a binary tree of each individal join. What this means is\r\nthat Diesel only has to consider one join at a time in trait\r\nimplementations.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, when considering nullability, we mistakenly only\r\nconsidered the outermost join. \"Considering nullability\" in this case\r\nmeans `impl SelectableExpression<TheJoin> for column`. If that trait is\r\nimplemented, we allow selecting the column directly. If it appears on\r\nthe right side of a left join, we do not want that trait to be\r\nimplemented, but we do want it implemented for `Nullable<column>`.\r\n\r\nThe problem code lived in two generated impls in the `table!` macro. For\r\neach individual column, we generate two relevant `SelectableExpression`\r\nimpls: one for inner joins, and one for left joins. Both of these impls\r\nwere wrong.\r\n\r\nThe impl for left joins was written as:\r\n\r\n    Left: AppearsInFromClause<$table, Count=Once>,\r\n    Right: AppearsInFromClause<$table, Count=Never>,\r\n\r\nwhich in English means \"where my table appears once in the left side of\r\nthe join, and doesn't appear in the right side of the join\". This\r\nincorrectly assumes that `$table` is the left-most table, or all joins\r\ncontained in `Left` are inner joins. If `Left == Join<other_table,\r\n$table, LeftOuter>`, this constraint incorrectly holds. This first case\r\nwas much easier to solve. The first line is changed to:\r\n\r\n    Self: SelectableExpression<Left>\r\n\r\nThe inner join case was much harder to solve. The constraint was written\r\nas:\r\n\r\n    Join<Left, Right, Inner>: AppearsInFromClause<$table, Count=Once>,\r\n\r\nIn English, this means \"my table appears in this join clause exactly\r\nonce\". This fails to consider that the position the table appears in may\r\nbe the right side of a left join. What we really want to write here is\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n    Self: SelectableExpression<Left> | SelectableExpression<Right>,\r\n\r\nWhere the pipe means \"either of these constraints are true\". Of course\r\nno such impl exists. If we write two separate impls, they are\r\noverlapping (and overlapping marker traits are not stable). So we need\r\nsomething different.\r\n\r\nSince the problem case applies only to columns, we know that the only\r\nreason that `SelectableExpression<Left>` and\r\n`SelectableExpression<Right>` both hold is if the table appears more\r\nthan once in the from clause, which we already reject. Because of this,\r\nwe know that when we want this impl to apply, `(<Left as\r\nAppearsInFromClause<$table>>::Count, <Right as\r\nAppearsInFromClause<$table>>::Count>)` will either be `(Once, Never)` or\r\n`(Never, Once)`.\r\n\r\nNow that we know we have two disjoint types, we can use that to\r\nimplement a new trait, which gives us either `Left` or `Right` depending\r\non which of the two counts was `Once`, and use that as the parameter for\r\n`SelectableExpression`. In English, the new bounds mean \"I am selectable\r\nfrom whichever of these two type parameters contains my table\"\r\n\r\nSince this new trait is only meant as a hack for this single impl, and\r\nis not public API, I wanted to avoid having it appear in compiler\r\nerrors. For this reason, I've added additional impls for all the invalid\r\ncount combinations. This will lead to an error such as:\r\n\r\n> table3::id: SelectableExpression<this_table_does_not_appear_in_the_from_clause>\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n> (Never, Never): Select<table1, table2>\r\n\r\nI did not add explicit compile tests for these errors, as I want to\r\nallow for the deletion of those impls if they become a problem in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThis lead to the final challenge which is that our `impl\r\nSelectableExpression<Join<...>> for Nullable<T>` actually relied on this\r\nbug. We considered `Nullable<T>: SelectableExpression<AnyJoin>` if `T:\r\nSelectableExpression<InnerJoin>`. This of course would break if the\r\nactual table is on the right side of a nested left join. To work around\r\nthis, we've introduced another new trait which recursively converts all\r\njoins in a tree to inner joins, which we then use for our check. This\r\nalso simplified the various impls for `Nullable<T>`, and should\r\ncorrectly ensure that `Nullable<T>` is always usable.\r\n\r\nFixes

you want to report a bug, we added some points below you can fill out. If you want to request a feature, feel free to remove all the irrelevant text. In addition to this [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues), you can also talk to Diesel maintainers and users on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** rustc 1.47.0 (18bf6b4f0 2020-10-07)\r\n- **Diesel:** 2.0.0 (master at time of writing) and 1.4.5\r\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL\r\n- **Operating System:** MacOS\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:** uuid, postgres\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\n\r\nWhen trying to join twice to the same table using an inner and left join, I get a compile error. For example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, Queryable)]\r\npub struct Object {\r\n    pub id: Uuid,\r\n    pub created_by: Uuid,\r\n    pub deleted_by: Option<Uuid>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Object {\r\n    pub fn search(conn: &PgConnection) -> Result<Vec<(Object, User, Option<User>)>, diesel::result::Error> {\r\n        objects::table\r\n            .inner_join(users::table.on(objects::columns::created_by.eq(users::columns::id)))\r\n            .left_join(users::table.on(objects::columns::deleted_by.eq(users::columns::id.nullable())))\r\n            .load(conn)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we drop either join and the expected return type, everything compiles fine. If both joins are present, it fails. Full setup for this can be found in https://github.com/mattdowdell/diesel-demo within this particular snippet coming from https://github.com/mattdowdell/diesel-demo/blob/master/src/models.rs.\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to do both joins.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nNot a compile error\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\nSomewhat large, but:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cargo build\r\n   Compiling diesel-demo v0.1.0

[issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [X] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel. (Your issue will be\r\n  closed if this is not the case)\r\n\r\nDiscussed with weiznich on Gitter over the past couple of days who suggested it might be related to #1459 (and thus #2001), which as far as I can tell is fixed on master and would trigger a different error. In case it made a difference, I tried 2.0.0 and unfortunately got the same issue.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your submission!

7ff5e6327d5e88095cb4b342da13bf06d6d0d1cd of \"not all methods had an equivalent type in `diesel::dsl`\" in a simpler way, without making \"`BoolExpressionMethods::and` (and `or`) unconditonally
