This is especially problematic because (as you describe), most times the update is not a breaking change.\n\nA **local solution** to this problem (i.e., on your's and `dotenv`'s end) would be to set the version requirements to `>= 0.28.0`. This would allow cargo to automatically bump to the latest version.\nThis would fix the behaviour currently caused by using the caret (`^`) operator, which for pre-`1.0.0` versions limits the project to `>= 0.28.0 < 0.29.0`, so we only get patch-based changes.\nThis is, however, problematic because packages which use this method will automatically pull in breaking changes to syntex, which will break their local builds.\n\nThe actual, **long-term solution** appears to be for syntex to version their builds more correctly according to semver.\nIf these version bumps are indeed non-breaking changes, then the syntex maintainers should be using patch bumps instead of minor bumps while they are pre-`1.0.0`.\n\nIf syntex can be considered stable now, then the solution is slightly different but still similar: set the version to `1.0.0` and use the minor version for non-breaking changes.\n\nI may be looking at this incorrectly, but for example, https://github.com/serde-rs/syntex/pull/38/files does not appear to introduce a breaking change to the syntex API but rather exposes a new method in the API, so it should've been a patch bump (as syntex is still pre-`1.0.0`).\n\nI realize that semver says that pre-`1.0.0` we shouldn't expect any consistency from APIs, but clearly this is resulting in an issue which needs to be worked around.\n\n@erickt, @sgrif any thoughts or
