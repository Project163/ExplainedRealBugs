We modified a struct field to be generic, and for backwards compatibility, we wanted to add the previous field type as the default trait implementation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#[derive(AsExpression, FromSqlRow)]\r\n#[diesel(sql_type = Geometry)]\r\n#[diesel(sql_type = Geography)]\r\npub struct Ewkb<B: AsRef<[u8]> = Vec<u8>>(pub B);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nI expected it to compile. 🙃 \r\n\r\nMore specifically, I expected the macro to expand to something like:\r\n```diff\r\n- impl<'expr, B: AsRef<[u8]> = Vec<u8>> AsExpression<Geometry> for &'expr Ewkb<B> {\r\n+ impl<'expr, B: AsRef<[u8]>> AsExpression<Geometry> for &'expr Ewkb<B> {\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\nTwo errors are produced by the current output:\r\n```\r\nerror: generic parameters with a default must be trailing\r\n  --> geozero/src/wkb/wkb_reader.rs:28:17\r\n   |\r\n28 | pub struct Ewkb<B: AsRef<[u8]> = Vec<u8>>(pub B);\r\n   |                 ^\r\n```\r\n```\r\nerror: defaults for type parameters are only allowed in `struct`, `enum`, `type`, or `trait` definitions\r\n  --> geozero/src/wkb/wkb_reader.rs:28:17\r\n   |\r\n28 | pub struct Ewkb<B: AsRef<[u8]> = Vec<u8>>(pub B);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these errors make sense only if you look at the expanded macro output. You see code like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl<'expr, B: AsRef<[u8]> = Vec<u8>> AsExpression<Geometry> for &'expr Ewkb<B> {\r\n                          ^^^^^^^^^^- THIS IS A PROBLEM!!! ( my own annotation 😉 )\r\n    type Expression = Bound<Geometry, Self>;\r\n    fn as_expression(self) -> Self::Expression {\r\n        Bound::new(self)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\n \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nlet me know if the above isn't clear\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) and the [discussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions) for similar possible closed issues.\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are unsure if your issue is a duplicate of an existing issue please link the issue in question here\r\n--> \r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
