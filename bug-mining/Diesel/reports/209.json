Setup\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** 1.50.0\r\n- **Diesel:** master\r\n- **Database:** mysql\r\n- **Operating System** macOS 11\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:** mysql, r2d2, chrono\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\nThe `UndecoratedInsertRecord` marker [implementation is not included](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/commit/a2996ee4f7f399e7b66449afa98c910ab23867fb#diff-fa14d901408aeec9013f13ab3f012dc73ab9766d9caa5a4981da18694bb0c555R93) when using `#[diesel(serialize_as=\"...\")]`, it is skipped alongside the (correctly skipped) borrowed insert impl as discussed by @thomaseizinger [here](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/2553#issuecomment-720757757).\r\n\r\nAs such, this makes it impossible to [insert a `Vec<T>`](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/ccfc42a1e9098fd1e288d701b6a2a832a88a6f9a/diesel/src/insertable.rs#L224) of anything that uses `serialize_as`.\r\n\r\nIs this indeed a mistake, or am I missing some reason for why this isn't allowed?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nFollowing my [conversation on Gitter](https://gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel?at=60512153e8267a46f21cc28a), in a simple `Insertable` derived struct, using `serialize_as` like so:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Insertable)]\r\n#[table_name = \"...\"]\r\npub struct Example {\r\n  // ...\r\n  #[diesel(serialize_as = \"OptionalSQLUTCDateTime\")]\r\n  pub last_play: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...renders `impl<'insert> Insertable<...> for Example {`\r\n\r\nHowever, not using `serialize_as`, like so:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Insertable)]\r\n#[table_name = \"...\"]\r\npub struct Example {\r\n  // ...\r\n  pub last_play: OptionalSQLUTCDateTime,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...renders `impl<'insert> Insertable<...> for Example {`, `impl<'insert> Insertable<...> for &'insert Example {` and importantly `impl<'insert> UndecoratedInsertRecord<...> for Example {}`","closed_by":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
