If the relevant files are large, please consider linking to a public repository or a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). This includes normally the following parts:\r\n\r\n* The exact code where your hit the problem\r\n* Relevant parts your schema, so any `table!` macro calls required for the\r\n* Any other type definitions involved in the code, which produces your problem\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- `diesel migration generate example`\r\n- Add the following\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n# example/metadata.toml\r\nrun_in_transaction = false\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- example/up.sql\r\nBEGIN TRANSACTION;\r\nCOMMIT TRANSACTION;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- example/down.sql\r\nBEGIN TRANSACTION;\r\nCOMMIT TRANSACTION;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run `diesel migration run` and see it works as expected\r\n- Run `diesel migration revert` and see it works as expected\r\n- Run `diesel migration redo` and see it fail\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues)  and the [disussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions)  for similar possible closed issues.\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are unsure if your issue is a duplicate of an existing issue please link the issue in question here\r\n--> \r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
