so this is a super subtle interaction. Our build randomly started\r\nfailing somewhere around a week ago. The `cargo-metadata` crate started\r\nto fail to compile for no apparent reason. The failure came from\r\n`#[derive(Deserialize)]` and the fact that fields on the struct were\r\nprivate, which shouldn't ever happen.\r\n\r\nThis was specifically when we run clippy and compile-test, which is on a\r\npinned version of Rust. The version of `cargo-metadata` being resolved\r\nhadn't changed, so that meant it must be serde. The version of serde\r\nthat gets resolved *did* change between the last passing build and the\r\nfirst failing one. But I tried `cargo update` and then `bin/test`\r\nlocally and it passed, so I was really confused.\r\n\r\nThe difference between what we do in `bin/test` and the clippy run is\r\nenable the `unstable` feature on `diesel`. This enables the `nightly`\r\nfeature on `diesel_derives`, which enables the `nightly` feature on\r\n`proc-macros2`. This causes hygiene to come into play where it didn't\r\nbefore, and as far as I'm aware serde does not work with hygiene turned\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe thing that changed is that serde updated its dependencies on\r\nsyn and proc-macro2. Which means they're now pointing at the same\r\nversion that we are. Which means that us enabling that feature is now\r\naffecting that crate, since features are additive (and according to\r\ncargo, every crate is supposed to work with any combination of features\r\nboth on itself and its dependencies even though that's not really\r\npractical).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what to do about this long term. After 1.2 is released, I'm\r\nplanning on actively encouraging people to turn on the unstable feature\r\nfor development, since it so dramatically improves our error messages.\r\nBut doing that apparently makes us incompatible with serde now... So\r\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nShort term though, if we don't enable the unstable feature, we don't\r\nhave this problem. So let's not.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I'm really shocked that `cargo-metadata` is the only\r\ntransitive dependency anywhere in our graph that hit this. Also why the\r\nfuck does that crate have serde as a required dependency? Presumably the\r\nonly reason that it's the only crate that hit it is because everyone\r\nelse has it behind a feature *like they should*\r\n\r\nFixes #1602","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1542962238,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTU0Mjk2MjIzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/1542962238","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-27T11:15:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
