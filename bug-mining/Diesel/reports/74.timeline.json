is important to allow structs with types like `Option<i32>` for\r\n`id` to be used with `Insertable`, since the column has a default.\r\nIdeally we would only allow this to work with columns that have a\r\ndefault value. I may make that change in future, but at the moment we do\r\nnot have a way of knowing which columns have a default.\r\n\r\nI am OK with the additional incorrect queries that this allows, as they\r\nwere already possible. There's no reason that `struct NewUser { name:\r\nOption<String>, hair_color: Option<String>, }` shouldn't work if `struct\r\nNewUser { hair_color: Option<String> }` works, as they both generate\r\nincorrect queries (name is not null and has no default in this example).\r\n\r\nI've documented the change as only affecting columns with a default, as\r\nwe reserve the right to disallow using `Option<T>` with columns that\r\nhave no default value in the future.
