If you want to request a feature, feel free to remove all the irrelevant text. In addition to this [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues), you can also talk to Diesel maintainers and users on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/diesel-rs/diesel).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** rustc 1.36.0 (a53f9df32 2019-07-03)\r\n- **Diesel:** 1.4.2\r\n- **Database:** PostrgreSQL, psql (11.4 (Ubuntu 11.4-0ubuntu0.19.04.1), server 9.6.13)\r\n- **Operating System** Ubuntu 19.04\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:** `\"postgres\"`\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\n\r\nWhen an SQL fails in nested transactions, the connection gets corrupted and all the other transaction running as SERIALIZABLE fails in `AlreadyInTransaction`.\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nJust writing an application. Transaction is nested in an accident\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\n`Ok(1)`\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\n`Err(AlreadyInTransaction)`\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\n\r\npostgresql output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npostgresql_1     | ERROR:  column \"foo\" does not exist at character 8\r\npostgresql_1     | STATEMENT:  SELECT foo\r\npostgresql_1     | ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block\r\npostgresql_1     | STATEMENT:  RELEASE SAVEPOINT diesel_savepoint_1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nrun code below\r\n\r\nCargo.toml\r\n```toml\r\n[package]\r\nname = \"diesel-bug-report\"\r\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\r\nedition = \"2018\"\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\ndiesel = {version = \"1.4.0\", features = [\"postgres\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nsrc/main.rs\r\n```rust\r\nuse diesel::pg::PgConnection;\r\nuse diesel::prelude::*;\r\nuse diesel::result::Error;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let conn = PgConnection::establish(\"postgres://user:password@localhost/database\").unwrap();\r\n    // fail once\r\n    let ret = conn.transaction(|| {\r\n        conn.transaction(|| {\r\n            // handling error\r\n            match conn.execute(\"SELECT foo\") {\r\n                // do nothing\r\n                Ok(_) => (),\r\n                // ignore the error\r\n                Err(e) => eprintln!(\"error occurred: {}\", e),\r\n            };\r\n            Ok::<_, Error>(())\r\n        })\r\n    });\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", ret);\r\n    // other transaction\r\n    let ret = conn\r\n        .build_transaction()\r\n        .serializable()\r\n        .run(|| conn.execute(\"SELECT 1\"));\r\n    // must be Ok(1), but get Err(AlreadyInTransaction)\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", ret);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, gets output\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cargo run\r\nerror occurred: column \"foo\" does not exist\r\nErr(DatabaseError(__Unknown, \"current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block\"))\r\nErr(AlreadyInTransaction)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error occurs with only when you use `.build_transacion()`.\r\nHowever, internally, the connection is unsound: `TransactionManager`'s depth is `1` which should be `0` at that point.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) for similar issues.\r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel. (Your issue will be\r\n  closed if this is not the case)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your submission!  You're helping make Diesel more robust 🎉\r\n\r\nWe'll try to respond as quickly as possible.\r\n-->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2123/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
