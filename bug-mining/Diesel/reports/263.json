For example, if we have\n\n``` rust\ntable! {\n  users {\n    id -> Serial,\n    name -> VarChar,\n    email -> VarChar,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere's nothing to prevent\n\n``` rust\nlet source = users.select((id, email, name));\nconnection.query_all::<User>(&source)\n```\n\nwhich would read the fields into the wrong pieces of the struct. The obvious solution is to access by the name of the fields, but then we have to figure out more concrete aliasing behavior and couple to it which I don't want. Needs further investigation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
