were sending the right bytes, but we weren't properly setting the\r\n`is_unsigned` flag on the bind parameters, resulting in it always being\r\nsent as signed. This results in a client error about overflow when\r\ndeserializing large values, and either a server error or incorrect\r\nresults when serializing them.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tests for this all used `-1` should have been a huge\r\nred flag, but it slipped through.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's no way for us to reasonably fix this without a\r\nbreaking change or crazy hacks (we could do something like write an\r\nadditional byte at the end if it's unsigned, but that's probably not\r\nworth it to avoid a breaking change). For that reason, we will need to\r\nmake the next version of Diesel 2.0. We shouldn't go crazy with this\r\nchange, but this would also allow us to make #1457 happen as well.\r\n\r\nThe other alternative would be to introduce a `Mysql2` backend, and\r\ndeprecate the

were sending the right bytes, but we weren't properly setting the\r\n`is_unsigned` flag on the bind parameters, resulting in it always being\r\nsent as signed. This results in a client error about overflow when\r\ndeserializing large values, and either a server error or incorrect\r\nresults when serializing them.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tests for this all used `-1` should have been a huge\r\nred flag, but it slipped through.\r\n\r\nWhile changing the type of `Mysql::BindCollector` could technically be\r\nconsidered a breaking change under the strictest definition, I do not\r\nconsider this to be one. We have stated in the past that folks should\r\nnot rely on the exact types used in `impl Backend`. And unlike changing\r\n`RawValue`, there's literally no reason for anybody to have depended on\r\nthe exact value of this type, unless they're implementing their own\r\nConnection.\r\n\r\nIf we really want to avoid any potential source incompatibility, we can\r\nactually do this without the custom bind collector, if we have the\r\n`ToSql` implementations for `Unsigned` add an extra byte at the end, and\r\ncheck to see if the length of the buffer is 1 byte larger than the\r\nexpected length. However, this is super hacky and much more likely to\r\nbreak applications than this approach.\r\n\r\nFixes #1745.\r\nClose
