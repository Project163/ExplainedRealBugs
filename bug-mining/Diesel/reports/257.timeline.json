This is currently somewhat expected behaviour. The provided bindings only cover systems we can actively test on. As neither any contributor nor GitHub actions provide an easy way to test on NetBsd we unfortunately cannot provide official support for this platform. That means we cannot guarantee that anything works there or continues to work. We accept contributions that fixes problems for these platforms as long as that does not affect supported platforms. Otherwise we cannot really work on solutions for such problems due to missing access to such systems. \n\nThat all written: The error message con certainly be better an should point out that the target is the problem, not the version. That's the reason why I keep this issue open for now. \n\nYou can likely workaround that problem by enabling the `buildtime_bindgen` feature for the `mysqlclient-system` crate. This will generate bindings based on your local libmysqlclient version.

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>This release wouldn't be possible without the support of our contributors and sponsors. If you want to support diesels development, consider [joining the reviewer team](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1186), submitting [PR's](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen++label%3A%22help+wanted%22+), help writing documentation or [sponsor the maintainers](https://github.com/sponsors/weiznich).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* Support `[print_schema] exclude_custom_type_definitions = [\"Vector\"]`. If a `custom type` matches one element on the list it's skipped.\r\n* Added automatic usage of all sqlite `rowid` aliases when no explicit primary key is defined for `print-schema`\r\n* Added a `#[dsl::auto_type]` attribute macro, allowing to infer type of query fragment functions\r\n* Added the same type inference on `Selectable` derives, which allows skipping specifying `select_expression_type` most of the time, in turn enabling most queries to be written using just a `Selectable` derive.\r\n* Added an optional `#[diesel(skip_insertion)]` field attribute to the `Insertable` derive macro, allowing fields which map to generated columns to be skipped during insertion.\r\n* Support for connection instrumentation. This allows to inspect any query run by your application\r\n* Logging in diesel-cli\r\n* Support for libsqlite3-sys 0.28\r\n* Add `sqlite-integer-primary-key-is-bigint` configuration option, usable with SQLite 3.37 or above, allowing to use `BigInt` for `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` columns in SQLite for tables without the `WITHOUT ROWID` attribute ([SQLite doc](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid)).\r\n* Support for multiple `print_schema` entry in `diesel.toml` (e.g. `[print_schema.user1]`), which allows generating multiple schema.rs files\r\n* Add support for `COPY TO` and `COPY FROM` statements\r\n* Add support for mapping `chrono::Duration` to postgresql's `INTERVAL` sql type\r\n* Added `serialize_database_to_buffer` and `deserialize_readonly_database_from_buffer` methods in `SqliteConnection` to support serialization/deserialization of SQLite databases to and from byte buffers.\r\n* Added `SerializedDatabase` wrapper type for a serialized database that is dynamically allocated by calling `serialize_database_to_buffer`. This RAII wrapper deallocates the memory when it goes out of scope with `sqlite3_free`.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* The minimal officially supported rustc version is now 1.78.0\r\n* Deprecated `sql_function!` in favour of `define_sql_function!` which provides compatibility with `#[dsl::auto_type]`\r\n* Deserialization error messages now contain information about the field that failed to deserialize\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @tp-woven made their first contribution in https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/3650\r\n* @aumetra made their first contribution in
