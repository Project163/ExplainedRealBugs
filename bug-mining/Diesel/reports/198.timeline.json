this macro is clearly a workaround I'm not happy with adding something like this to diesel, as removing stuff that's in the public API is quite hard (= requires a major version bump). Additionally this is a feature that is not supported yet on already released diesel versions + it is \"easily\" possible to write the required impls outside of diesel with the new release I would rather not add such a macro as temporary workaround for a single version.

commit adds support for more kinds of `GROUP BY` clauses.\r\n\r\n* We implement now `ValidGrouping<table::primary_key, IsAggregate = Yey>` for each column\r\nof that table, as according to the postgres documentation it is\r\nsufficient to have only the primary key in the group by clause\r\n* We provide a basic infrastructure to handle `GROUP BY` clauses\r\nconsisting of more than one column by introducing a\r\n`IsContainedInGroupBy` helper trait. It is currently used to check if a\r\ncolumn is part of a composite `GROUP BY` clause by checking if the\r\ncorresponding tuple contains this column. As basic requirement an  `impl\r\nIsContainedInGroupBy<column_a> for column_b { type Output = No; }` is\r\nrequired for each pair `column_a` and `column_b` that should be allowed\r\nto appear together in a `GROUP BY` clause. This is automatically\r\nimplemented for all columns belonging to one table. For cross table\r\ncases the `allow_columns_to_appear_in_same_group_by_clause!` macro is\r\nprovided. (This macros just skips the default per table generated\r\nimpls). As future extension we may want to generate a call to that macro\r\nfor all columns in a generated schema, after checking the impact on\r\ncompile times of having that much impls.\r\n* Additionally this commit adds a bunch of test cases that cover the old\r\nand new allowed usecases of `GROUP BY` clauses\r\n\r\nFixes #2370, CC #210","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/2549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3926229963,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5MjYyMjk5NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/3926229963","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"78b74aff70537dd636745917d1a10c948793f117","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weiznich/diesel/commits/78b74aff70537dd636745917d1a10c948793f117","created_at":"2020-10-27T14:25:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3931678689,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5MzE2Nzg2ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/3931678689","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9dc1ce4c0db980c4bf7b7d57d514c7d9fda79597","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weiznich/diesel/commits/9dc1ce4c0db980c4bf7b7d57d514c7d9fda79597","created_at":"2020-10-28T14:47:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3947708097,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk0NzcwODA5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/3947708097","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-02T11:47:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
