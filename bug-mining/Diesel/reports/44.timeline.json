`table!` in `src/schema.rs`.\n- The R2D2 connection pool is created in `src/server.rs`.\n- The code path that invokes all of this is in `src/api/r0/registration.rs`.\n- The helper for pulling a connection out of the pool is in `src/db.rs`.\n- The two Diesel models are in `src/user.rs` and `src/access_token.rs`.\n\nLet me know what other info I can provide to help narrow this

to this commit, the error will occur when you attempt to call\n`execute`, `get_result`, or `get_results`. The message will indicate\nthat those methods don't exist, because `InsertQuery` doesn't implement\n`QueryFragment`, with a very long generic type signature. The reason for\nthis being that `StructName` doesn't implement `Insertable`,\n`&StructName` does.\n\nThis now handles this common error as quickly and directly as possible.\nThe error message will now be:\n\n```\nerror: mismatched types:\n expected `&_`\n    found `StructName`\n```\n\nThis does cause a minor change in functionality, as it becomes\nimpossible to pass an owned value to `insert`. I don't think this is a\nproblem, as really the only thing this removes is the ability to\nconstruct an insert statement and the return the query without executing\nit, e.g.:\n\n``` rust\nfn build_insert_query(name: &str) -> Box<QueryFragment<Pg>> {\n    let new_user = NewUser { name: name };\n    insert(new_user).into(users::table)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this case just doesn't seem like it matters, and I'm fine with\nlosing support for it.\n\nFixes #249.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":610219999,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDYxMDIxOTk5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/610219999","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5d8f3e97cc528f12bbddf8cab71bca2ab03ae4b0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/5d8f3e97cc528f12bbddf8cab71bca2ab03ae4b0","created_at":"2016-03-31T18:22:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":610313059,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NjEwMzEzMDU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/610313059","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-03-31T19:32:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
