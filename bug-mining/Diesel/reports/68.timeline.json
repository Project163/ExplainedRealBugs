pull request allows the `table!` macro and codegen to handle tables\nwhich use more than one column for their primary key. At the moment they\nare fairly useless, but they will compile.\n\nThe methods in question are primarily used for `FindDsl` and\nassociations. Things like update are defined in terms of `FindDsl` and\n`Identifiable`. Since the generators for those traits don't handle\ncomposite primary keys, none of that can be used (yet).\n\nWorking on this also made me realize a bit of a hole in our type system.\nWe implement `Expression` for a tuple of expressions as a comma\ndelimited list. However, a comma delimited list isn't always valid. In\nparticular a composite table _does_ actually implement `FindDsl` for an\nexpression that matches it's primary key -- and would generate invalid\nSQL like `pk1, pk2 = $1, $2`. Luckily, we're saved by the fact that\ntuples don't implement `AsExpression`, so trying to do `.find((1, 2))`\nwon't compile.\n\nI'm not sure if we should fix this or not, but the fix would basically\nmean separating out \"arbitrary expression\" from \"expression valid as a\nselect or returning clause\", and potentially other places where tuples\nappear such as set clauses and in expressions. For now though, as long\nas the inproper code doesn't compile for the reasonable cases, I'm not\nsuper worried. We should fix this eventually though, as I don't like\nsomething that we can statically determine is invalid SQL compiling.\n\nRef
