Using the feature `exclude_custom_type_definitions` introduced with https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/4002 and documented with https://diesel.rs/guides/configuring-diesel-cli.html#the-exclude_custom_type_definitions-field.\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nNo custom definition and an import of the postgis-diesel type(s).\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\nThe custom definition is created and rather than saving output to `src/schema.rs` a new file is created with the name of the value of `exclude_custom_type_definitions`.\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\n\r\nNo additional errors. Patching the documentation or the CLI configuration to align would be great. Diesel CLI saving to a filename other than configured is also worthwhile fixing. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUse a `diesel.toml` configured as below. Then run `diesel migration redo`.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[print_schema]\r\nfile = \"src/schema.rs\"\r\ncustom_type_derives = [\"diesel::query_builder::QueryId\"]\r\nimport_types = [\"diesel::sql_types::*\", \"postgis_diesel::sql_types::*\"]\r\nexclude_custom_type_definitions = [\"Geometry\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the desired output `except_custom_type_definitions` has to be used rather than `exclude_custom_type_definitions`. This will properly save output to `src/schema.rs` and will use the postgis-diesel type.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) and the [discussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions) for similar possible closed issues.\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are unsure if your issue is a duplicate of an existing issue please link the issue in question here\r\n--> \r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
