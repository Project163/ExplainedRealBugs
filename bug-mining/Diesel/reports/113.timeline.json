recently I noticed that the `krate::download` test would fail for me if I was running them while I was in a different day than UTC was (that is, after 8pm EDT). This test never fails on travis because travis' machines have their system clocks in UTC.\r\n\r\nBeing in PDT last week gave me 3 extra hours where I could easily test this :) I discovered that what was happening was the version download made by [the request to the `/download` route in the test](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/blob/master/src/tests/krate.rs#L977-L986) was being recorded as happening in the date in my current timezone, but the queries were asking for dates [based on yesterday in UTC](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/blob/master/src/tests/krate.rs#L1011) (which was today in my current timezone!)\r\n\r\nThis changes the default value of the date column in the version_downloads table so that it's always using the current date in UTC.\r\n\r\nThis might cause some weirdness in the download graphs for a crate by day when we deploy it since it'll abruptly change how we're recording things, but oh well. I would argue the old way is incorrect and now we're fixing it :)\r\n\r\nAlso obligatory:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://memecrunch.com/meme/BSJOG/timezones/image.jpg?w=400&c=1\" alt=\"khan timezones meme\"

Setup\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n- **Rust:** 1.59.0\r\n- **Diesel:** 1.4.4\r\n- **Database:** mysql\r\n- **Operating System** CentOS Stream 8\r\n\r\n### Feature Flags\r\n\r\n- **diesel:**\r\n\r\n## Problem Description\r\n\r\nThe mysql configuration file sets the default time_zone\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# cat /etc/my.cnf | grep time_zone -C 1\r\n[mysqld]\r\ndefault-time_zone = '+8:00'\r\nport            = 3306\r\n```\r\nBut I found that diesel resets the time_zone for every link:\r\n```rs\r\nimpl MysqlConnection {\r\n    fn prepare_query<T>(&self, source: &T) -> QueryResult<MaybeCached<Statement>>\r\n    where\r\n        T: QueryFragment<Mysql> + QueryId,\r\n    {\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    fn set_config_options(&self) -> QueryResult<()> {\r\n        self.execute(\"SET sql_mode=(SELECT CONCAT(@@sql_mode, ',PIPES_AS_CONCAT'))\")?;\r\n\r\n       // here\r\n        self.execute(\"SET time_zone = '+00:00';\")?;\r\n\r\n\r\n        self.execute(\"SET character_set_client = 'utf8mb4'\")?;\r\n        self.execute(\"SET character_set_connection = 'utf8mb4'\")?;\r\n        self.execute(\"SET character_set_results = 'utf8mb4'\")?;\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nDo not overwrite `my.cnf` when linking by default, or how to override how `set_config_options` is executed\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\n`time_zone = '+8:00'`\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n`time_zone = '+00:00'`\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\nnull\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nnull\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I comment out `self.execute(\"SET time_zone = '+00:00';\")?;` I get the correct time after data insert\r\n\r\n```rs\r\n    fn set_config_options(&self) -> QueryResult<()> {\r\n        self.execute(\"SET sql_mode=(SELECT CONCAT(@@sql_mode, ',PIPES_AS_CONCAT'))\")?;\r\n        // self.execute(\"SET time_zone = '+00:00';\")?;\r\n        self.execute(\"SET character_set_client = 'utf8mb4'\")?;\r\n        self.execute(\"SET character_set_connection = 'utf8mb4'\")?;\r\n        self.execute(\"SET character_set_results = 'utf8mb4'\")?;\r\n        Ok(())\r\n
