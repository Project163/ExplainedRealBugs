{\r\n    use diesel::sql_types::*;\r\n    use diesel_ltree::sql_types::*;\r\n\r\n    chunks (id) {\r\n        id -> Int8,\r\n        parent_id -> Nullable<Int8>,\r\n        path -> Ltree,\r\n        label -> Text,\r\n        estimated -> Int4,\r\n        nchildren -> Int4,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease include as much of your codebase as needed to reproduce the error.
