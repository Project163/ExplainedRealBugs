Unlike some other ORMs, Diesel has chosen to override the previous value for all query builder operations besides `filter`. (For example, `.order(:foo).order(:bar)` in Ruby on Rails will generate `ORDER BY foo, bar`).\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is that it's unclear whether the order given last by the user should be considered more important or less important. Most members of the Rails team consider the behavior of order to be a mistake. The only reason `filter` is given special treatment here is that it is the only query builder method where we can combine its arguments in an associative fashion.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't want to discount this use case, it is definitely one that is less common, which is why it was de-prioritized in favor of the tuple-based API that is causing pain here. I don't have any ideas on what this API should look like. Perhaps it'd make sense to have an API that takes a `Vec`, and applies it in the manner that this PR is attempting to do (I would actually love to have a vec passed to `order` behave in exactly this fashion)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/347365176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-30T15:32:33Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T15:32:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1322","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1322/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1322/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1322/events","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1322","id":278019752,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzgwMTk3NTI=","number":1322,"title":"creating
