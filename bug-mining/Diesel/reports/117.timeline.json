Enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThis project is slowly growing big and we're facing the death threat, we have no unit test!\r\n\r\nThis is a gold mine! You can open as many pull request as you can to cover all of the code we have in unit tests. But remember, each pull request must be done for a whole module (for example, one model per pull request is ok, but if you open 4 pull requests for 4 random function, it will be rejected right away).\r\n\r\nGood luck
