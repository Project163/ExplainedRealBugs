client library puts the responsibility on us to clear the\r\nnetwork buffers before continuing. This is problematic in cases where we\r\nexecute a query that returns results (and thus has additional frames\r\nthat need to be flushed), but in a context where we're ignoring them.\r\n\r\nThe old implementation used `mysql_next_result`, which advances to the\r\nnext result in the query, and returns whether we just advanced to the\r\nfinal result or not. Because it returns false on the last result, and\r\nnot if there are no more results to advance to, we had to call\r\n`mysql_store_result` a final time after the last call to\r\n`mysql_next_result`.\r\n\r\nThe problem case is when a query only has a single result. In MySQL 6\r\nand earlier, the second call to `mysql_store_result` would return a null\r\npointer. In MySQL 8, it will return an error instead. To fix this, I've\r\nseparated out the \"more results\", which will give us the behavior we\r\nwish `mysql_next_result` had.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure why migrations weren't affected by this, as I'd\r\nexpect to get the same behavior in a migration that contained only a\r\nsingle statement with no results, but apparently this only occurs if\r\nthere is a statement that does have results.\r\n\r\nI have not updated the version of MySQL on Travis, because I want a CI\r\nrun to make sure I didn't break things on 6.x. I will update it to point\r\nat 8.0 before merging.\r\n\r\nThis change does not require additional tests, as we already have\r\nregression tests in place for this case.\r\n\r\nThis fix justifies a patch release backported to 1.3.\r\n\r\nFixes #1826.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1841459382,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg0MTQ1OTM4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/1841459382","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T15:24:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4043925467,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQwNDM5MjU0Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/4043925467","actor":{"login":"disconsented","id":1381469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE0Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented","html_url":"https://github.com/disconsented","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disconsented/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4d98afbfa032ce0727ab857f85635a245e601e90","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NarrativeApp/diesel/commits/4d98afbfa032ce0727ab857f85635a245e601e90","created_at":"2020-11-26T21:41:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
