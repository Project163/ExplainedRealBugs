used to be the case that _everything_ had to go through `Connection#query_all` and `Connection#query_one`. I found it was annoying, and added too many parenthesis, which is why `load` and `first` were added. (`connection.query_all(users.filter(name.eq(\"Sean\")))` vs `users.filter(name.eq(\"Sean\")).load(&connection)`.\n\nI want to give the same treatment to these (technically `load` actually works fine, but I think that `update(users.filter(id.eq(1))).set(name.eq(\"Sean\")).load(&connection)` reads really strangely). We should add some new methods (the names are up for debate):\n- `run(&connection)`: We often know that we will return exactly one row. The should return `QueryResult<T>`, and will basically be `load(&connection).map(|mut r| r.nth(0).unwrap())`.\n- `run_all(&connection)`: Alias for `load`. Probably a better name for this, but I want it to imply that we're doing a command that happens to return.\n- `execute(&connection)`: Alias for `Connection#execute_returning_count`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/29/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":477980905,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDc3OTgwOTA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/477980905","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"caea99a34e7846f4f1536c1454e94340ece256c0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/commits/caea99a34e7846f4f1536c1454e94340ece256c0","created_at":"2015-11-30T17:28:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
