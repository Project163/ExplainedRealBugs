After having spend some time to dig into this I fear there is no much we can do here. From a technical point of view there are two possibilities to generate this \"nicer\" error message\":\r\n\r\n1. The proc macro itself generates the diagnostic. Unfortunately this is nothing that is possible yet using stable rust. See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54140. Even with that API implemented it wouldn't be possible to emit the additional `help` line, as again there is no API to query if such a similar named field exists. Having both API's would be really nice, but that's unfortunately nothing that can be fixed on diesels side only. Consider working on the compiler side of things here, if you want work on improvements.\r\n2. The proc macro itself can generate \"valid\" rust code, where the compiler itself emits the corresponding error message, as this would be done for any other rust code. Unfortunately this is not possible here, as `type` is never a valid identifier. Technically speaking we could likely emit code containing `type` as field name, but this will generate an error message just stating that `type` is no valid identifier which would at least point to the correct span. Unfortunately this comes with an really large cost: We couldn't use `syn` anymore, which would mean we need to implement support for parsing and generating rust code all on our own. That is not something I consider to do, at least not without much larger gains.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that could actually be done is to improve [this error message](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/e78ae2311f087d56b7c371b0a203f00bb04583be/diesel_derives/src/meta.rs#L79) to say something more meaningful. We are happy to receive a PR doing that.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/847925988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4793193043,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ3OTMxOTMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/4793193043","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-25T14:38:55Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4793193045,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ3OTMxOTMwNDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/4793193045","actor":{"login":"weiznich","id":1674512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzQ1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1674512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich","html_url":"https://github.com/weiznich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiznich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-25T14:38:55Z","label":{"name":"good
