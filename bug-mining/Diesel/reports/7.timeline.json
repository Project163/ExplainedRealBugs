far `update` is the hardest to wrap my head around, and I was hoping for some clarification/guidance.\n\nIn the context of an HTTP API, with a users table that looks like:\n\n``` Rust\ntable! {\n    users {\n        id -> Serial,\n        first_name -> VarChar,\n        last_name -> VarChar,\n        email -> VarChar,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nhow would you go about implementing a Users#update action?\n\nMy first instinct is to have something like:\n\n``` Rust\n#[changeset_for(users)]\npub struct UserChanges {\n    id: i32,\n    first_name: Option<String>,\n    last_name: Option<String>,\n    email: Option<String>,\n}\n\nfn update(req: SomeHTTPReq) -> SomeHTTPRes {\n  let changeset = UserChanges {\n    first_name: req.body.get(\"first_name\"),\n    // etc\n  }\n\n  changeset.save_changes(&connection)\n}\n```\n\nSuch that you end up updating whatever valid params the user sends, but that requires having `Nullable` columns in the table macro, when the columns aren't actually nullable.\n\nKeep up all the great work!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/26/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/26/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":477210694,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ3NzIxMDY5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/477210694","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-29T23:07:10Z","label":{"name":"accepted","color":"009800"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":477235781,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQ3NzIzNTc4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/477235781","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-30T00:45:24Z","milestone":{"title":"0.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":477235782,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50NDc3MjM1Nzgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/477235782","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-30T00:45:24Z","milestone":{"title":"0.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/160496032","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/29#issuecomment-160496032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/29","id":160496032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDQ5NjAzMg==","user":{"login":"mfpiccolo","id":3249825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDk4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3249825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo","html_url":"https://github.com/mfpiccolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com
