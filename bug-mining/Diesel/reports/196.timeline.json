Description\r\n\r\nThe following query gives some errors, mixing aggregate and non-aggregate expressions\r\n```rust\r\ndiesel::table! {\r\n    foo (uuid, date) {\r\n        uuid -> Uuid,\r\n

accomplish?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to translate this valid SQL query to diesel dsl\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE foo (\r\n    uuid uuid PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,\r\n    date timestamp DEFAULT now() NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n\r\nSELECT uuid, max(date) date FROM foo GROUP BY uuid;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\nBeing able to mix such expressions when it's valid sql\r\n\r\n### What is
