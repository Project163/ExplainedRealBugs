I've started to give this some serious thought. @tafia has started some of the work on this in #72. Here's a rough overview of what has to change, in order of easiest to hardest, along with what I think might be possible solutions, but I'm not yet sure.\n\nJust as a note, while I haven't decided if I will support MySQL in the long term, I do want whatever changes we make here to make it possible to _theoretically_ support MySQL, as that will help ensure that we can truly support N adapters and not just 2. In an ideal world, this is done in a way that additional adapters can be added as third party crates.\n\nI'm writing this up to help clarify my thoughts, get some eyes on it to see if I'm missing anything, and give a roadmap for anyone who wants to take on a piece of this. I would prefer that we solve the harder bits (or at least have a strong indication that we have a solution that will work) before we bother with the easier pieces.\n- `Connection` needs to become generic. Should be trivial, but need to audit the public API for anything that doesn't translate.\n- `Cursor` somehow needs to become generic.\n  - This one is a pain in the ass, and I wish we didn't have to do it. Any way that we end up doing this will basically mean that users who want to point at this as a return type will have to put connection specific information in their signatures.\n  - This will eventually just be replaced by [impl trait](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1305) in whatever form it eventually lands, as I want the return type here to be `impl Iterator<Item=T>`. The current direction that's heading seems like it'll be useable for our needs (basically anything that doesn't require us to state the concrete type higher than the function level, as that would end up requiring HKTs to work here).\n    - I don't expect that feature to be in stable pre-1.0, so I expect that we'll just have to bite the bullet here, and bump to 2.0 at some point to change to impl trait.\n- Many of the types we support right now are specific to PG.\n  - The easy answer is to move everything that isn't also supported by Sqlite to a separate diesel-postgres crate, or under a config flag.\n    - I am comfortable treating Sqlite as the \"lowest common denominator\" for SQL implementations and leaving those in the main crate. To my knowledge there is no type that is supported by sqlite (without extensions) that isn't supported by all backends. \n    - There is definitely value in leaving these types non-backend specific. The vast majority of schemas are dominated by strings, integers, dates, and their variants. We want crates to be able to add functionality around those without caring about backend when possible\n  - We should change the constraint on `Connection` to be `trait Connection where {all std lib primitives and all fundamental sql types}: ToSql<Type, Self>`.\n    - We should also constrain that an impl is required for the nullable versions of all of those. If we ever see Higher Ranked Types, what we should write instead is `for <ST: NativeSqlType, T: ToSql<ST, Self>> Nullable<T>: ToSql<ST, Self>`\n    - An unresolved question here is whether or not we should also require implementations of optional 3rd party crates that we've deemed important enough to support in the core adapter (e.g. `chrono`). I'm leaning towards no, since those won't be in the core crate when compiled w/ no features, which is what crates abstracting over us would depend on.\n  - Array is an unfortunate loss here, as it's the only other type that is generic besides `Nullable`, and might be painful to abstract over without coupling to the backend (Oracle and SQLServer also support arrays).\n    - As far as I can tell, there is no other generic type in PG or any other backend that is unbounded. Range is the closest, but even it's restricted to a known subset.\n    - I'd like to resolve the question of \"is there any unbounded generic type supported by any backend other than array?\"\n  - JSON is an additional unfortunate loss. 2 of the 3 cases I'm looking at (MySQL and PG) have a JSON data type, and it would be nice to eventually write `impl<T: serde::Deserialize> FromSql<Backend, JSON> for T where String: FromSql<Backend, JSON>`, since that would not be backend dependent. I'm not sure we can ever do that though, since with these API changes that impl _could_ access backend specific code. We might need some sort of `MappedFromSql` trait.\n- `ToSql`, `FromSql`, `Expression`, and `Query` need to become generic over the backend, as do _any_ traits generic over them.\n  - This is going to include things like `AsExpression`, `AsQuery`, `Queryable`, `FromSqlRow`, and likely more.\n  - Are we sure that `Expression` and `Query` need to be generic? `Query` does if `Expression` does to be sure, but are there any fundamental SQL statements that change based on the back end?\n    - As I wrote that, `Bound` becomes the obvious case.\n  - Again, this shouldn't be too hard, but I'd like to canvas our existing users to see how often any of these traits show up in their code for internal abstractions they've built.\n- `NativeSqlType` is coupled to PG\n  - `oid` and `array_oid` are the trouble cases here.\n  - The best solution that comes to mind is to have it be `NativeSqlType<Backend>`, giving `Backend` an associated `Metadata` type, and having a `metadata` function that returns that struct.\n    - We should try to eliminate the `new` function if we go this route\n    - Is the compiler smart enough to eliminate some copying if I only use one field of the returned struct, and the function impl is just a struct literal?\n      - Is this still true if it's going through a trait object?\n      - Does it even matter? Is our worst case for a performance hit a few extra `i32` copies? We should benchmark regardless\n- Note for the last 2 points: This is making it clear to me that I want the \"backend\" type to be different from the connection. So we would have `Connection<Backend> where i32: ToSql<Integer, Backend>, ...` and we'd have `impl Connection<PG> for PgConnection`. This is because there's a lot of structs that will need to become generic over the backend which need to remain 0-size, and I'd like to avoid using `PhantomData` any more than we are, as it tends to be an indication that you're doing something which cannot be made object safe.\n- Our handling of bind params is fundamentally at odds with SQLite's API.\n  - Just to clarify:\n    - PG's API takes a query, an array of oids, an array of `char*`s (for the data), an array of lengths, and an array of booleans indicating whether it's text or binary\n      - As such, our `push_bind_param` function takes a type and an `Option<Vec<u8>>`. We can calculate the lengths ourselves, we get the oid from the type, and we always pass binary.\n    - MySQL is similar. They take an array of `MYSQL_BIND` structs, which consists of an enum for the type, a `void *` for the data, and a length. Whether the data is binary or text is dictated by the type. Text data still fits into our `Vec<u8>` fine.\n    - SQLite instead has several functions that you call, based on the type of the bind param. These functions in general take a statement pointer, the index of the bind param, the data itself _which is usually by value and a specific type, not a pointer_, and a length in places where it makes sense.\n      - What's important to note here is that the requirement of a statement pointer means that we can't actually call these functions in the place where we currently call `to_sql`.\n      - Our code related to constructing bind params currently does not know or care about the index.\n      - SQLite is unique in that it has no IO protocol that you can use (which is sorta the point), so we are bound to its C API.\n  - This is by far the hardest one to solve\n  - One potential solution (I think I prefer the one proposed later) would basically be to create a `BoxToSql<Backend>` trait, take the type on _construction_, and return that. This would mean `ToSql` falls to dynamic dispatch. This is potentially a catastrophic perf hit.\n  - This is potentially awful, but there's actually no reason we can't just continue to use our current API. We can read a `Vec<u8>` back into an `i32`. We lose all guarantees of type safety at that layer of abstraction, but we should in theory be guaranteed that we're fine by the layer above. Since we have a very small subset of types that we need to worry about, we can just match on a type identifier to determine what to do. If we see performance hits in the read, we can even do some unsafe casts from `Vec<u8> -> &u8 -> *const u8 -> *const i32` and dereference it _if we really need to_.\n    - This seriously sounds so horribly dirty, but the more I think about it the more it could actually work, and is starting to be my favored option as it doesn't require significant changes to the API for other adapters, and won't cause a performance hit for them either.\n    - This is all dependent on the fact that SQLite has a _known set_ of types that we have to deal with. As far as I can tell, no extensions add types which affect the C API, particularly in the handling of bind parameters. We need to confirm that this is true, otherwise we need to provide an API that crates can hook into.\n- A scorched earth solution if we truly can't find a type safe solution that abstracts over multiple backends is to just take the traits or structs that need to change, and just put them under `#[cfg(feature = \"postgresql\")]`. This would mean we don't have to find an _actually_ generic API for different backends, but would be incredibly harmful to the ability for third party crates to provide additional abstractions, and would mean that Diesel would _never_ be able to be used with more than one type of database in the same application.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/172110839/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":516695331,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE2Njk1MzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/516695331","actor":{"login":"tafia","id":7351502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia","html_url":"https://github.com/tafia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-15T22:15:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":516695332,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNjY5NTMzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/516695332","actor":{"login":"tafia","id":7351502,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE1MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia","html_url":"https://github.com/tafia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tafia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-15T22:15:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/172111808","html_url":"https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/39#issuecomment-172111808","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/39","id":172111808,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjExMTgwOA==","user":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-15T22:21:03Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T22:21:03Z","body":"@mfpiccolo @samphippen @mcasper It's long, and pretty technical, but I'd like to get thoughts on the above. Also if any of you are interested in helping tackle some of this, have at it.\n\n@tenderlove, @rafaelfranca, @senny, @metaskills -- I know none of you are involved in this project or Rust, but I think you guys would be able to provide some valuable insight as well. I'm happy to clarify our API and how these problems relate to it in ways that don't require knowledge of the language if you'd like.\n\n@metaskills: In addition, I'd be interested to hear if you think this will be enough for SQL Server. I've more or less looked at this from a high level WRT MySQL as the third case, but knowing that it can handle another DB is a good indication that we will in fact be generic after this.\n\nAfter writing this up, I _think_ I've got my thoughts organized enough that I can see a reasonable path to implementing this. From what I can tell, the proposed solutions will also put us in a place for others to write additional database adapters without having to have them in the primary crate. We can essentially put this to the test by having postgres and sqlite live in separate crates. @e-oz, you've expressed interest in having MySQL support in the past. It'd be great if you were interested in working on that as a third party crate, as well.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/comments/172111808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":516699296,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE2Njk5Mjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/516699296","actor":{"login":"mfpiccolo","id":3249825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDk4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3249825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo","html_url":"https://github.com/mfpiccolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-15T22:21:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":516699298,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNjY5OTI5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/516699298","actor":{"login":"mfpiccolo","id":3249825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDk4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3249825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo","html_url":"https://github.com/mfpiccolo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfpiccolo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-15T22:21:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":516699299,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE2Njk5Mjk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/events/516699299","actor":{"login":"fables-tales","id":96662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales","html_url":"https://github.com/fables-tales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fables-tales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-15T22:21:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":516699300,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNjY5OTMwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/d
