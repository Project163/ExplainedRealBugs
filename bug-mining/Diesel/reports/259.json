[`SerializedDatabase::drop()`](https://docs.diesel.rs/2.2.x/src/diesel/sqlite/connection/serialized_database.rs.html#39) always passes that pointer to [`sqlite3_free()`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/free.html).  That means that the following call will cause heap corruption:\r\n```rust\r\ndiesel::sqlite::SerializedDatabase::new(&mut 0, 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to accomplish?\r\n\r\nSafely serialize and deserialize a SQLite database. \r\n\r\n### What is the expected output?\r\n\r\n### What is the actual output?\r\n\r\n### Are you seeing any additional errors?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n`cargo run` segfaults when I put the above example into `main()`:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cat Cargo.toml\r\n[package]\r\nname = \"diesel-unsoundness\"\r\n[dependencies]\r\ndiesel = { version = \"2.2.1\", default-features = false, features = [\"sqlite\"] }\r\n$ cat src/main.rs\r\nfn main() {\r\n    diesel::sqlite::SerializedDatabase::new(&mut 0, 1);\r\n}\r\n$ cargo run\r\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s\r\n     Running `target/debug/diesel-unsoundness`\r\nzsh: segmentation fault  cargo run\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have already looked over the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/issues) and the [discussion forum](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/discussions) for similar possible closed issues.\r\n<!--\r\nIf you are unsure if your issue is a duplicate of an existing issue please link the issue in question here\r\n--> \r\n- [x] This issue can be reproduced on Rust's stable channel.
