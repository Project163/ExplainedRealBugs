The first is [this code](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/pull/1165/files#diff-0f3c021dc67b888eef8a6619689208cbR19). It's a papercut, but I don't like the fact that if you get the argument to `insert` wrong, the message is going to be that you passed the wrong number of arguments to `into`. Maybe this isn't a big deal (I don't think it's ever come up in gitter), but it's a paper cut I'd like to avoid, and I think it will be easier to run into once #789 is done.\r\n\r\nThe second is that I've been thinking about an API to represent `INSERT INTO table (column_list) SELECT ...`. The best idea I've seen based on our current API is `insert(select_statement).into(column_list)`, but that feels a little implicit to me. If we changed the insert API, I could see something like `insert_into(table).columns(column_list).values(select_statement)` or `insert_into(table).from_select(column_list, select_statement)` being much more reasonable.","closed_by":{"login":"sgrif","id":1529387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjkzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1529387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif","html_url":"https://github.com/sgrif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1167/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diesel-rs/diesel/issues/1167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
