The handler set with `setNotFoundHandler` is not called\r\n2. The handler set with `setErrorHandler` _is_ called, but the error passed in does not have a `statusCode` property, nor `name: \"FastifyError\"` etc, so it's not reliably distinguishable from an unhandled error from somewhere else.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/9b1877626bb345f3a4746d678bc56b0bb23b7f2a/lib/handleRequest.js#L57-L58\r\n\r\nIf possible, calling the notFoundHandler seems like the most intuitive approach to me. Otherwise I think calling `reply.send(new FST_ERR_NOT_FOUND())` instead of a plain `Error` would be acceptable.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can clarify anything. Thank you!\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nSay I want a plain text response instead of JSON:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst fastify = require('fastify')();\r\n\r\nfastify.setNotFoundHandler((request, reply) => {\r\n  reply.status(404).send(\"Resource not found\");\r\n});\r\n\r\nfastify.setErrorHandler((error, request, reply) => {\r\n  reply.status(error.statusCode || 500).send(error.message);\r\n});\r\n\r\nfastify.listen(3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl -vX PURGE localhost:3000\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nResponse status: 404\r\nResponse body: `Resource not found`","closed_by":{"login":"Eomm","id":11404065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDA0MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11404065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm","html_url":"https://github.com/Eomm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3702/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
