I checked out [`fastify-compress`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-compress) to see how it handles this problem and found that it [serializes the payload itself](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-compress/blob/671d3731d1e32f5572d52abf1413107850a19fc4/index.js#L103-L105) using `reply.serialize()` if it is not already a stream or string. Unfortunately, that particular solution isn't complete because to be fully compatible with the current version of Fastify it would need to duplicate most of [Fastify's serialization code](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/c76e366b1d1dc4b10ceb679e0a25cf6bc19bb814/lib/reply.js#L140-L159).\r\n\r\nThis means that any `onSend` hook that needs the serialized payload would also need to duplicate Fastify's serialization code, or alternatively, require users to serialize the payload and set the right headers themselves before calling `reply.send()`. It doesn't seem right to put that burden on developers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the documentation for [Hooks](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/c76e366b1d1dc4b10ceb679e0a25cf6bc19bb814/docs/Hooks.md) currently includes the following information:\r\n\r\n> If you are using the onSend hook you can update the payload, for example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfastify.addHook('onSend', (request, reply, payload, next) => {\r\n  var err = null;\r\n  payload.hello = 'world'\r\n  next(err, payload)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdating the payload in this way does not seem very useful and could actually be considered bad practice. If anyone needs to modify a payload in that way, they could use a custom serializer or set a response schema to be used by `fast-json-stringify`.\r\n\r\nWith this information in mind, I'd like to propose that the order of serialization and `onSend` hooks be switched so that serialization happens before running the hooks. With this format, `onSend` hooks will receive the serialized payload—which can still be modified just like it can be now. This will also allow the `onSend` hooks to see the right `Content-Type` header (which is set when the payload is serialized).","closed_by":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
