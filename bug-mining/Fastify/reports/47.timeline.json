🐛 Bug Report\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Testing.md claims that this is legal syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfastify\r\n  .inject()\r\n  .get('/')\r\n  .headers({ foo: 'bar' })\r\n  .query({ foo: 'bar' })\r\n  .end((err, res) => { // the .end call will trigger the request\r\n    console.log(res.payload)\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there are only two available types for inject():\r\n\r\n```\r\n    inject(opts: HTTPInjectOptions | string, cb: (err: Error, res: HTTPInjectResponse) => void): void\r\n    inject(opts: HTTPInjectOptions | string): Promise<HTTPInjectResponse>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence builder-style inject fails to compile in TypeScript.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n        const response: fastify.HTTPInjectResponse = await app\r\n          // @ts-ignore\r\n          .inject()\r\n          .get('/endpoint')\r\n        expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTypeScript compiler correctly accepts inject() without parameters and expects builder to be returned.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n- *fastify version*:

Currently, the information about the pandemic is highly fragmented, especially at the local level. Whereas one can find global information and trackers, it is difficult to find information that is relevant to your community. Furthermore, it is difficult for organizations, funders, companies, volunteers and local leaders to coordinate responses. This puts humanity and local communities at risk.
