Instead the error is unhandled and propagated to the Node runtime which kills the app. Removing the hook all together or using a synchronous approach (with `done()`) resolves the issue.\n\nThis issue seems similar to https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/2707\n\n### Link to code that reproduces the bug\n\nhttps://github.com/jakedipity/scratchspace/tree/main/fastify-bug\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nError handler should be called (we should see a `setErrorHandler <Error>` logged), the client is given a response, and the instance continues running. Instead the handler is not called, the connection socket hangs up, and the instance crashes.","closed_by":{"login":"Eomm","id":11404065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDA0MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11404065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm","html_url":"https://github.com/Eomm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/6214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/6214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
