🐛 Bug Report\r\n\r\nI add a custom error handler to add some extra data to my api answer (stack, ...).\r\n- I send a request too an elasticsearch server, which reply an answer (an error) with a content-length of 335 bytes.\r\n- In my error handler, I answer with bigger body (more than 335 bytes content-length).\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nIf a thrown error have headers.'content-length' properties it is propagated to the fastify answer like #2214 but with an errorHandler.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport fastify from 'fastify';\r\n\r\nconst server = fastify();\r\n\r\nserver.get('/', async (request, reply) => {\r\n  const error = new Error('MY_ERROR_MESSAGE');\r\n  error.headers = {\r\n    'content-length': 2,\r\n  };\r\n  throw error;\r\n});\r\n\r\nserver.setErrorHandler((error, request, reply) => {\r\n  reply.code(500).send({ error: 'longer than 2' });\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst start = async () => {\r\n  await server.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');\r\n};\r\n\r\nstart();\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -v http://127.0.0.1:3000/\r\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1...\r\n* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 3000 (#0)\r\n> GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: 127.0.0.1:3000\r\n> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n> \r\n< HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\r\n< content-length: 2\r\n< content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n< Date: Tue, 08 Sep 2020 13:33:51 GMT\r\n< Connection: keep-alive\r\n< Keep-Alive: timeout=5\r\n< \r\n* Excess found in a non pipelined read: excess = 23, size = 2, maxdownload = 2, bytecount = 0\r\n* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAnswer generated by my error handler should have the right content length.\r\nIt has the following side effects : \r\n- if my answer is smaller than 2 bytes : it hangs for 5secs\r\n- if my answer is bigger than 2 bytes : my answer is truncated and my json is not valid.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n- *node version*: 14\r\n- *fastify version*: >=3.3.0\r\n- *os*: Linux\r\n\r\nThx","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-11T12:18:48Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T12:18:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paulohp/api.gwei.live/issues/6","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paulohp/api.gwei.live","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paulohp/api.gwei.live/issues/6/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paulohp/api.gwei.live/issues/6/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paulohp/api.gwei.live/issues/6/events","html_url":"https://github.com/paulohp/api.gwei.live/pull/6","id":829099287,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTkwODE5MDg4","number":6,"title":"Bump
