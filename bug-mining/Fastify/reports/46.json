I would like to have this changed and make it act like `express` does. What express does is: set the status code to `302` when `redirect` is called. You can still sent an other code by providing it in the redirect like so: `res.redirect(404, '/login')`.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nRight now I'm using the [nestjs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. Nest currently supports multiple routing libraries such as `express` and `fastify`. `nestjs` is setting the http status code default to `200` or `201` depending on the type of request (`GET`, `POST`). When I'm redirecting the request with `redirect` it returns it with a status of `200` instead of `302` this forms an issue because the browser won't redirect.\r\n\r\nI hope we could change `fastify` to set the status to `302` by default when `redirect` is called. You could still sent a custom code by putting it like: `res.redirect(404, '/not-found')`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1592/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1592/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
