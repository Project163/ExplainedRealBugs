Additionally, both libraries are being maintained with intent to support legacy webpack versions (all the way to webpack v1). As a result, they contain a lot of bloat that makes them slower and harder to maintain.\r\n> \r\n> `fastify-webpack-hot` is built from the ground up leveraging the latest APIs of Fastify and webpack, and it encompasses functionality of both libraries. It is faster and easier to maintain.","closed_by":{"login":"RafaelGSS","id":26234614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjM0NjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26234614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS","html_url":"https://github.com/RafaelGSS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RafaelGSS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3792/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
