in https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/642 we have decided to not encapsulate `onRoute` and `onRegister`, almost two years after, the use of this hooks in our plugins has changed, and make this two hooks encapsulated is now the right choice.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, doing so will introduce a breaking change, since the behavior of those hooks will change slightly.\r\n\r\n**`onRoute`**\r\nThe hook will be called asynchronously, in v1/v2 it's called as soon as a route is registered. This means that if you want to use it, you should register this hook as soon as possible in your code.\r\n\r\n**`onRegister`**\r\nSame as the `onRoute` hook, the only difference is that now the very first call will no longer be the framework itself, but the first registered plugin.\r\n\r\nFixes: #1970\r\n\r\nI'll keep this as a draft pr until https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/1954 is merged, then I'll rebase on `next`.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] run `npm run test` and `npm run benchmark`\r\n- [x] tests and/or benchmarks are included\r\n- [x] documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] commit message and code follows [Code of conduct](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/comments/563137260","html_url":"https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/1970#issuecomment-563137260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1970","id":563137260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MzEzNzI2MA==","user":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-09T09:14:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T09:14:15Z","body":"Hello!

in https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/642 we have decided to not encapsulate `onRoute` and `onRegister`, almost two years after, the use of this hooks in our plugins has changed, and make this two hooks encapsulated is now the right choice.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, doing so will introduce a breaking change, since the behavior of those hooks will change slightly.\r\n\r\n**`onRoute`**\r\nThe hook will be called asynchronously, in v1/v2 it's called as soon as a route is registered. This means that if you want to use it, you should register this hook as soon as possible in your code.\r\n\r\n**`onRegister`**\r\nSame as the `onRoute` hook, the only difference is that now the very first call will no longer be the framework itself, but the first registered plugin.\r\n\r\nFixes: #1970\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] run `npm run test` and `npm run benchmark`\r\n- [x] tests and/or benchmarks are included\r\n- [x] documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] commit message and code follows [Code of conduct](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2910969775,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTA5Njk3NzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/2910969775","actor":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"80d87c959fcbb2ae00295bebbd1d912c97f64184","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/commits/80d87c959fcbb2ae00295bebbd1d912c97f64184","created_at":"2019-12-27T16:02:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/comments/569297251","html_url":"https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/1970#issuecomment-569297251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1970","id":569297251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTI5NzI1MQ==","user":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-27T16:03:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-27T16:03:10Z","body":"Closed
