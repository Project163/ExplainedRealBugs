If anyone does have a good use case for modifying an unserialized payload though, then I would rethink my stance on this proposal.\r\n\r\n@delvedor Has a good [point](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/330#issuecomment-334081794) in #330 about how modifying the unserialized payload in an `onSend` hook can cause problems:\r\n\r\n> if the user is using `fast-json-stringify` the `onSend` could change the payload in unexpected ways, causing lot headaches.\r\n\r\nAs of right now, here are the main use cases I see for the `onSend` hook:\r\n\r\n1. Saving application state (i.e. sessions)\r\n2. Setting extra headers before the response is sent\r\n  • This sometimes requires the serialized payload (i.e. to generate an ETag header)\r\n3. Changing the format of the payload (i.e. turning it into a stream)\r\n  • This should include clearing the payload to send an empty body if the hook decides that a `304 - Not Modified` response should be sent, but there are complications with this if serialization happens during or after the hooks\r\n\r\nNotice how case 1 doesn't care about the payload, case 2 sometimes requires the serialized payload, and  case 3 always requires the serialized payload.\r\n\r\n@mcollina's Idea of exposing the serialization logic through `reply.serializer` could work, although I think this could make things a little more complicated and a bit of performance may be lost because:\r\n\r\n+ Hooks that need the serialized payload will always need to call the `reply.serializer` logic\r\n  + Reason: If the hook is passed a string as the payload, it won't know if it's the serialized payload or a string that still needs to be serialized (JSON string)\r\n+ `onSend` hooks that serialize the payload will need to remember to call `next(null, serializedPayload)` or else the payload will need to be serialized again later on\r\n+ The full type-checking/serialization logic will always need to be run after the `onSend` hooks because the payload may or may not have been serialized during the hooks\r\n  + (If serialization happened before the hooks, the code after the hooks would only need to make sure the payload is the right type to send)\r\n+ Some of this could be avoided with an `alreadySerialized` flag, but flags usually make code more difficult to maintain\r\n  + It probably isn't even possible to have a flag like this because if the `reply.serializer` logic is a public API, users will expect to be able to call it whenever they want even if it's already been called to serialize the payload\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/comments/358806986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nwoltman","id":5128013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjgwMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5128013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman","html_url":"https://github.com/nwoltman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwoltman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1431447171,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQzMTQ0NzE3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/1431447171","actor":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-18T22:45:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1431447172,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MzE0NDcxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/1431447172","actor":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-18T22:45:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1431447174,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQzMTQ0NzE3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/1431447174","actor":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-18T22:45:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1431447175,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MzE0NDcxNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/even

now happens before the `onSend` hooks, so the hooks receive the serialized payload.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a feature where an `onSend` hook can replace the payload with `null` to send a response with an empty body without having the `Content-Type` header get set to `0`. This was not possible before because `null` would either get serialized as JSON or be considered an unserialized value and cause an error to be thrown. (It would be preferable to do this by setting the payload to `undefined` in the hook, but `undefined` currently means that the payload was not changed.)\r\n\r\nFixes #672 \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Benchmarks</summary>\r\n\r\n**master**\r\n```\r\n[1] Stat         Avg     Stdev   Max\r\n[1] Latency (ms) 3       10.65   354\r\n[1] Req/Sec      32459.2 6549.24 37215\r\n[1] Bytes/Sec    4.89 MB 984 kB  5.77 MB\r\n[1]\r\n[1] 162k requests in 5s, 24.2 MB read\r\n...\r\n[1] Stat         Avg     Stdev   Max\r\n[1] Latency (ms) 2.98    10.58   376\r\n[1] Req/Sec      32734.4 6533.01 37695\r\n[1] Bytes/Sec    4.89 MB 984 kB  5.77 MB\r\n[1]\r\n[1] 164k requests in 5s, 24.4 MB read\r\n```\r\n\r\n**this PR**\r\n```\r\n[1] Stat         Avg     Stdev   Max\r\n[1] Latency (ms) 3       10.45   341\r\n[1] Req/Sec      32497.6 6392.17 37535\r\n[1] Bytes/Sec    4.84 MB 964 kB  5.77 MB\r\n[1]\r\n[1] 162k requests in 5s, 24.2 MB read\r\n...\r\n[1] Stat         Avg     Stdev   Max\r\n[1] Latency (ms) 3.01    10.63   295\r\n[1] Req/Sec      32372.8 6272.62 37503\r\n[1] Bytes/Sec    4.78 MB 940 kB  5.77 MB\r\n[1]\r\n[1] 162k requests in 5s, 24.1 MB read\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] run `npm run test` and `npm run benchmark`\r\n- [x] tests and/or benchmarks are included\r\n- [x] documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] commit message and code follows [Code of conduct](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1433745260,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQzMzc0NTI2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/1433745260","actor":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-20T16:02:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
