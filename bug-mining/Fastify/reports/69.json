If one is trying to investigate an incident multiple requests now share the same id.\r\n\r\nThis is of low impact I'd assume, still I think it would be nice to disable this behaviour in a proper way instead of relying on obfuscation.  \n\n### Example\n\n```\r\nconst fastify = require('fastify')({\r\n  requestIdHeader: false // (disabled instead of default value)\r\n})\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"Eomm","id":11404065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDA0MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11404065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm","html_url":"https://github.com/Eomm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eomm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
