When this symbol is received from a hook, or any function in the request life _prior_ to the defined request handler, Fastify should issue a `res.send()` that sends any headers and content currently attached to `res` to the requesting client.\r\n\r\nThis should also take the place of returning `undefined` to signal the same thing. Thus, when `undefined` is received from such a function, a deprecation notice/error/warning should be logged.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAs highlighted in https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/2070 and https://github.com/fastify/help/issues/135 , it is unclear how one should terminate a request response before reaching the handler.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfastify.addHook('onRequest', () => {\r\n  // do something\r\n  return Symbol.for('fastify.end-request')\r\n})\r\n\r\n// or\r\n\r\nfastify.addHook('onRequest', (req, res, next) => {\r\n  // do something\r\n  next(null, Symbol.for('fastify.end-request'))\r\n})\r\n\r\n// or\r\n\r\nfastify.addHook('onRequest', async (req, res) => {\r\n  // do something\r\n  return Symbol.for('fastify.end-request')\r\n})\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
