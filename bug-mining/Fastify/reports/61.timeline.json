#3652.\r\n\r\nAs I am going through the process of getting this PR together, I am more convinced that this is the right path. I have had to jump through several hoops to cover cases of \"was this signature provided? That one? This one?\", and deal with adding/removing coverage from tests. Once we get past the deprecation phase, the listen code will be simplified by virtue of completely removing that `normalizeListenArgs` function and the ceremony around feeding it.\r\n\r\nTechnically, as implemented, the signature is still variadic since it accepts a second, optional, parameter for the callback. Should we require the callback in the options object? This would be slightly odd in that it isn't a typical pattern. But we already internally support (and actually require) `listenOptions.cb` be defined when a callback is to be used.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] run `npm run test` and `npm run benchmark`\r\n-

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I have written a descriptive issue title\n- [X] I have searched existing issues to ensure the feature has not already been requested\n\n\n### 🚀 Feature Proposal\n\nAdd `.listenIPC(path[, backlog])` method to listen on a named pipe or an UNIX domain socket.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn fasitfy@4 it is possible to create an [IPC server](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/net.html#ipc-support) (i.e. server listening on a named pipe or an UNIX domain socket).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true })\r\n\r\n// https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/net.html#serverlistenpath-backlog-callback\r\nfastify.listen('/path/to/socket.sock')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this behavior is not documented, there are [type definitions](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/2601) and [tests](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/3709671b73c9109ef54fa1e85de0d7b7f7946226/test/listen.test.js#L186-L204).\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that we will not be able to use this method in v5 because variadic listen method is deprecated and will be removed. (#3652)\r\n\r\n```\r\n[FSTDEP011] FastifyDeprecation: Variadic listen method is deprecated. Please use \".listen(optionsObject)\" instead. The variadic signature will be removed in `fastify@5`.\r\n```\n\n### Example\n\nCreate a Docker plugin:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst fastify = require('fastify')({ logger: true })\r\n\r\nfastify.get('/', async () => {\r\n  return { status: 'TODO' }\r\n})\r\n\r\nfastify.listenIPC('/run/docker/plugins/myplugin.sock')\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"joshwlewis","id":917672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNzY3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/917672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis","html_url":"https://github.com/joshwlewis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshwlewis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-24T18:00:05Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T18:00:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/sf-fx-runtime-nodejs/issues/393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/sf-fx-runtime-nodejs","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/sf-fx-runtime-nodejs/issues/393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/sf-fx-runtime-nodejs/issues/393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/forcedotcom/sf-fx-runtime-nodejs/issues/393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/forcedotcom/sf-fx-runtime-nodejs/pull/393","id":1349822245,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCbqZRc49vUWo","number":393,"title":"Silence
