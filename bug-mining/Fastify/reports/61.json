Start with a deprecation notice for v4, but remove the variadic signature for v5.\r\n>\r\n> _Originally posted by @jsumners in https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/3606#discussion_r790275606_\r\n\r\nThe Fastify code is quite difficult to follow and maintain in a lot of places. We should be taking every opportunity we can to simplify the code, and to make the public interfaces less confusing. We emulated Node core's `.listen` method in an effort to retain as much familiarity as possible. I am quite certain I made the argument to do such. But at this point I think:\r\n\r\n1. Variadic interfaces are confusing for developers and should be avoided now that object destructuring, and parameter defaults, are widely available.\r\n2. Many newcomers to Fastify have likely never touched Node core's `net.Server`.\r\n3. We owe it to ourselves to make the code we maintain easier.","closed_by":{"login":"jsumners","id":321201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners","html_url":"https://github.com/jsumners","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3652/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
