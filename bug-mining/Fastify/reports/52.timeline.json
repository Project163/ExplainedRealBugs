routes, one that has a trailing slash and the prefix and the other without the trailing slash it will also auto generate generate `HEAD` routes (if `exposeHeadRoute` is set to `true`) for both of the new endpoints which was the primary source of the duplication bug, setting `exposeHeadRoute` to `false` when attempting to add the second route seems to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nif `prefixTrailingSlash` is set to `'no-slash'` then fastify will create a `GET` route and (if `exposeHeadRoute` is set to `true`) fastify will generate one `HEAD` route however it actually create a route where the prefix is concatenated twice, this is due to the fact that the path passed is an empty string `''` and the options object used to create the `HEAD` route is the \"same\" one that was used to create the original route, `''` empty strings are not truthy so the `path` string which is found on the `GET` options object is used to create the `HEAD` route, this is fixed by using `/` as a path to create the the `HEAD` route instead of of `''`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2790/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/2790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4244637655,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI0NDYzNzY1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/4244637655","actor":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-25T09:49:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4244637902,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyNDQ2Mzc5MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/4244637902","actor":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f3d5742f5398e37401d9ea0766d9a37d6f38f08a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/commits/f3d5742f5398e37401d9ea0766d9a37d6f38f08a","created_at":"2021-01-25T09:49:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
