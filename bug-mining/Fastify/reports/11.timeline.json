this example in the docs will help other noobs like me. :)\r\n\r\nThere is a note in [Reply Header](http://www.fastify.io/docs/v0.27.x/Reply/#header) documentation:\r\n_Note that if you are using a custom serializer that does not serialize to JSON, you must set a custom 'Content-Type' header._\r\n\r\nIt is better if the documentation include an additional example to that note.\r\nFor example this simple code:\r\n\r\n`reply.send('OK');`\r\nwill output \r\n\r\n> \"OK\"\r\n\r\nDouble quoted because by default fastify will do JSON serialization, while\r\n`reply.header('Content-Type', 'text/html').send('OK');`\r\nor using shortcut\r\n`reply.type('text/html').send('OK');`\r\nwill output\r\n\r\n> OK\r\n\r\nwithout the double quote.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-22T17:57:08Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T17:57:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1937","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1937/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1937/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1937/events","html_url":"https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/1937","id":521545958,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzM5OTA0OTcz","number":1937,"title":"Skip
