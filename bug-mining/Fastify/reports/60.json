When we look at the CI results for commit https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/3712/commits/5a77a6b9a93d0b1e1c830a8c9bce997b2bcc7646 we can see that Coveralls is suggesting coverage remains at 100% for all OSes, but `tap` is saying otherwise:\r\n\r\nhttps://coveralls.io/jobs/94867280\r\n![fastify - Vivaldi 2022-02-20 18-57-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/321201/154870207-1abffa81-21bf-4d6e-b6a6-7297c8ba1437.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fastify/fastify/runs/5267302531?check_suite_focus=true\r\n![fastify - Vivaldi 2022-02-20 18-58-03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/321201/154870226-abfc2622-d256-4933-b3cb-5f476dfa44c1.png)\r\n\r\nWith #3717 and #3719, we will have coverage reports attached to the GitHub Actions panel itself. We'd have to download the artifacts to inspect what coverage is missing, instead of browsing a hosted website (Coveralls), but at least it'd be consistent and accurate(?).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jsumners","id":321201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners","html_url":"https://github.com/jsumners","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsumners/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
