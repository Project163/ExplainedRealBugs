Prerequisites\n\n- [X] I have written a descriptive issue title\n- [X] I have searched existing issues to ensure it has not already been reported\n\n\n### Fastify version\n\n3.17.0\n\n### Plugin version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Node.js version\n\n14.16\n\n### Operating system\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating system version (i.e. 20.04, 11.3, 10)\n\n11.4\n\n### Description\n\nwhen receiving a http request that contains invalid url encoding I get the following log output\r\n\r\n```\r\n07:48:34 ✨ incoming request GET xxx /%C0\r\n07:48:34 ⚠️  the default handler for 404 did not catch this, this is likely a fastify bug, please report it\r\n07:48:34 ⚠️  └── / (ACL)\r\n    / (BIND)\r\n    / (CHECKOUT)\r\n    / (CONNECT)\r\n    / (COPY)\r\n    / (DELETE)\r\n    / (GET)\r\n    / (HEAD)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs stated in #1884, the result should actually be a 400 and we should not log errors to the log.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nSetup an empty default project\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir my-app\r\ncd my-app\r\nnpm init fastify\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen send the following request (e.g. via `httpie`)\r\n```bash\r\nhttp 'localhost:3000/%c0'\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe server should return a 400 and not log errors to the log.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/3127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/comments/857503660","html_url":"https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/1884#issuecomment-857503660","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1884","id":857503660,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NzUwMzY2MA==","user":{"login":"rburgst","id":22971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst","html_url":"https://github.com/rburgst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rburgst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-09T08:37:54Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T08:37:54Z","body":"@Eomm
