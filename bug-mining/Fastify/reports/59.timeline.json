#3702\r\n\r\nIn the case of an HTTP method that's unsupported by Fastify, call the default or custom not found handler instead of calling `reply.send` with an error.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that since there's no way of registering an unsupported method on the router, when the bottom of `handleRequest` is reached, the context is guaranteed to be a 404. So I can't see any reason why the existing approach is preferable to just calling the context's handler as normal.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your pull request.
