We could simply remove the reference to the generic `<T>` and improve the separation between the TypeScript-specific parts and the rest.\n\n2. Another option would be to move the TypeScript content to a dedicated section in the TypeScript docs and link to it. Personally, I believe it's valuable to keep some TypeScript explanations here, as it helps users to understand how to combine early dependency checks with typing in the same place, while avoiding module augmentation. Those not interested can keep the TypeScript parts.\n\n3. Since @mcollina recently proposed creating an official blog in an internal discussion, `getDecorator` could be a great candidate for an article. On a more general note, referencing articles would help keep the documentation simpler and less opinionated, while offering a deeper dive for those looking for implementation guidance.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/comments/2981101563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jean-michelet","id":110341611,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpOt6w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110341611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet","html_url":"https://github.com/jean-michelet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jean-michelet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18194882873,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBCRpgs679eAkzwAAAAQ8f-E5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/18194882873","actor":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:53:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18194882891,"node_id":"SE_lADOBCRpgs679eAkzwAAAAQ8f-FL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/18194882891","actor":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:53:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18207793678,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBCRpgs679eAkzwAAAAQ9ROIO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/events/18207793678","actor":{"login":"emicovi","id":1388987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg5ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi","html_url":"https://github.com/emicovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emicovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"50fd80e89dbb07aed92a1ecc3716e0e52157555f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emicovi/fastify/commits/50fd80e89dbb07aed92a1ecc3716e0e52157555f","created_at":"2025-06-18T10:38:18Z","performed_via_github_
