💬 Questions and Help\r\n\r\nI try to encapsule the rate-limit plugin to its own fastify instance.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst fastify = require(\"fastify\");\r\nconst fastifyRateLimit = require(\"fastify-rate-limit\");\r\nconst ioredis_1 = require(\"ioredis\");\r\nconst server = fastify();\r\nconst start = async () => {\r\n    server.get('/', async (request, response) => {\r\n        return { hello: 'world' };\r\n    });\r\n    server.register(async (instance, opts) => {\r\n        instance.register(fastifyRateLimit, {\r\n            max: 1,\r\n            timeWindow: 10 * 1000,\r\n            redis: new ioredis_1.default()\r\n        });\r\n        instance.get('/limit1', async (request, response) => {\r\n            return { limit: 1 };\r\n        });\r\n        instance.get('/limit2', async (request, response) => {\r\n            return { limit: 2 };\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n    server.get('/broken', async (request, response) => {\r\n        return { broken: true };\r\n    });\r\n    await server.listen(3000);\r\n};\r\nstart()\r\n    .catch((e) => {\r\n    throw e;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOnly the routes `/limit1` and `/limit2` should have the rate-limit plugin \"attached\".\r\nBut currently the route `/broken` is also limited by the rate-limiter, while the `/` is without any rate-limit.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understood the `.register` function it shall gave you a new scope of fastify that you can modify without effecting the \"outer\" fastify instance.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n- *node version*: 13.3.0\r\n- *fastify version*: 2.11.0\r\n- *fastify-rate-limit version*: 3.0.1\r\n- *os*: Linux","closed_by":{"login":"delvedor","id":4865608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjU2MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4865608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor","html_url":"https://github.com/delvedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/delvedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1970/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
