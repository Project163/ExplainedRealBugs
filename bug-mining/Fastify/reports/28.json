However, as far as I know, Fastify could have couple additional properties like `statusCode` or `validation`.\r\n\r\nSo it's better to introduce custom interface or class that extends `Error` and use it. Also it will be easier to extend that interface in plugins if they add some new fields to the Error type.\r\n\r\nI could try make PR, but I don't know if there are any other properties. So that would be great if someone will help with listing all available error properties.\r\n\r\n- *fastify version*: latest\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
