to track migration to the reusable workflows, as well as anything extra:\r\n\r\n-   Snyk badge can be removed as the dependency-review job does the same thing as Snyk, see https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/3883\r\n-   Coveralls badge can be removed as these workflows (and the workflows in the main repo) don't use it, see https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/3720\r\n\r\nThe main blocker to migrating plugins is that the reusable workflows use `npm test` and `npm run lint` to perform testing and linting respectively. Some plugins use `npm run test:ci`, `npm run test:tap`, and `npm run lint:ci`, or some variations of them for their CI testing.\r\n\r\n| Plugin                      | Moved to Reusable Workflow
