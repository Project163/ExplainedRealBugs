I am not wrong and `RequestRouteOptions` is its actual type. It exists, but if you use it in typescript, you will get `any`.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if the type is similar to [RouteHandler](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/c3a9f49d534026eb0305c2948a0d99fc05692f96/types/route.d.ts#L162-L175), but `this`w will be typed as `never`, because trying to access it will
