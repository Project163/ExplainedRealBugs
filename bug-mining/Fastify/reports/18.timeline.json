🐛 Bug Report\r\n\r\nWhen calling `reply.send` within an async preValidation hook, this does not abort the request and thus emits a `Response has already been sent` error. Related: #677\r\n\r\nAccording to the linked issue and pr, it should have been fixed, however it doesn't seem to be (At least for me):\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\nHook:\r\n```js\r\nfastify.addHook(\"preValidation\", async function (request, reply) {\r\n  reply.code(403).send({error: \"unauthenticated\"});\r\n});\r\n```\r\nHandler:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = function (fastify, opts, next) {\r\n   fastify.get(\"/\", {}, async (request, reply) => {\r\n       // This gets still executed, and reply.sent is true here\r\n   });\r\n   next();\r\n}\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe handler should not get called.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n- *node version*: 10.16.0\r\n- *fastify version*: >=2.5.0\r\n- *os*: Windows,
