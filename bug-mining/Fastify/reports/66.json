This broke one of our tests, since in v4.14.0, aborted requests only caused `onRequestAbort` to be called, but not also the error handler, which is behavior that we depended on.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I found out that the error handler isn't even called reliably:\r\n\r\n* When `onRequestAbort` hook is registered, the error handler is called\r\n* When `onRequestAbort` hook isn't registered, the error handler is never called\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the error passed to the error handler is not `instanceof Error` and doesn't have a `statusCode` property, unlike indicated by TypeScript types for `FastifyError`, which the parameter is. In fact, the error given is the response object returned from the route handler. This poses a problem for us because we're logging errors, but the response objects can contain sensitive data, which we don't want to log.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCode sample for reproduction:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { fastify } from 'fastify'\r\nimport net from 'node:net'\r\nimport { setTimeout } from 'node:timers/promises'\r\n\r\nconst app = fastify()\r\napp.setErrorHandler(async (error, request, reply) => {\r\n  console.log(error, error instanceof Error, error.statusCode)\r\n})\r\napp.get('/', async (req) => {\r\n  console.log('receive start', req.id, req.raw.destroyed)\r\n  await setTimeout(500)\r\n  console.log('receive end', req.id, req.raw.destroyed)\r\n  return { hello: 'world' }\r\n})\r\n\r\n// Comment out the following line, the error handler will not be invoked\r\napp.addHook('onRequestAbort', async (req) => console.log('abort', req.id))\r\n\r\nawait app.listen({ port: 0 })\r\n\r\nconst socket = net.connect(app.server.address().port)\r\nsocket.write('GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: example.com\\r\\n\\r\\n')\r\nawait setTimeout(200)\r\nsocket.destroy()\r\n\r\nawait setTimeout(1000)\r\nawait app.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen invoked as stated above, the output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> node index.js\r\nreceive start req-1 false\r\nabort req-1\r\nreceive end req-1 true\r\n{ hello: 'world' } false undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the line commented out:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> node index.js\r\nreceive start req-1 false\r\nreceive end req-1 true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPreferrably, I wouldn't want aborted requests be considered errors, even when a response is sent (i.e. revert #4611). But I do understand the intent of that PR, so if it's not an option, I'd expect the following:\r\n\r\n* Call the error handler no matter if `onRequestAbort` hook is registered\r\n* Pass an instance of `FastifyError` to the error handler, with a generic error message, instead of the response body","closed_by":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4626/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
