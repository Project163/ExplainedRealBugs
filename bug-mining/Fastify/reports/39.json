Add the code from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ericmacfa/e5331a632464ec4530c7a42617b67f45) to index.js\r\n    <details>\r\n    <summary>Bare-bones snippet</summary>\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    const fastify = require('fastify')();\r\n\r\n    // This issue occurs with both callback and promise based `onSend` hooks\r\n    fastify.addHook('onSend', (request, reply, payload, done) => {\r\n        setTimeout(() => {\r\n            done(null, payload);\r\n        }, 50);\r\n    });\r\n    fastify.route({\r\n        method: 'GET',\r\n        path: '/',\r\n        preHandler: async function(request, reply) {\r\n            console.log('GET / -> preHandler()');\r\n            reply.redirect('/login');\r\n        },\r\n        handler: function(request, reply) {\r\n            console.log('GET / -> handler() !! This should never be shown !!');\r\n            reply.send({ hello: 'world' });\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    fastify.route({\r\n        method: 'GET',\r\n        path: '/login',\r\n        handler: function(request, reply) {\r\n            console.log('GET /login -> handler()');\r\n            reply.send('Please log in\\n');\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    fastify.listen(3000);\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    </p>\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n3.  `node ./index.js`\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `curl -L localhost:3000` (Or via a browser, postman, etc.)\r\n2. Notice that the `/` route handler was called, even though we responded in the `preHandler` hook.\r\n    ```\r\n    server listening on port 3000\r\n    GET / -> preHandler()\r\n    GET / -> handler() !! This should never be shown !!\r\n    GET /login -> handler()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Additional notes (from gist code comments)\r\n\r\n-   This issue occurs when either the callback or the promise based `onSend` hook is used.\r\n-   This issue occurs when the promise based `preHandler` hook is used, but not when the callback based version is used.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n1. `curl -L localhost:3000`\r\n2. The handler for the `/` route should not be called.\r\n    ```\r\n    server listening on port 3000\r\n    GET / -> preHandler()\r\n    GET /login -> handler()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n-   _node version_: `10.16.0`\r\n-   _fastify version_: `2.6.0`\r\n-   _os_: Mac\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mcollina","id":52195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina","html_url":"https://github.com/mcollina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcollina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/1733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
