When it was linked in a discussion, I was very confused about what document I was reading. I thought I was reading our TypeScript specific document, but I wasn't. I was particularly confused because the code snippets didn't show what the `<T>` thing was doing or why it is necessary.\n\nI think this section of the documentation should be updated to match its surroundings. It should simply document the method in the same style as the other decorator access methods:\n\nhttps://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/93d51eaa326245b6b58724f14b315c70cb2e0c36/docs/Reference/Decorators.md?plain=1#L268-L293","closed_by":{"login":"Uzlopak","id":5059100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5059100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak","html_url":"https://github.com/Uzlopak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/6222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/6222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
