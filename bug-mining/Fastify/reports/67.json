(Well, `id` value is supposed to be provided by `genReqId` in the first place)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe type definition should be something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ngenReqId?: <...>(req: RawRequest) => string,\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"Uzlopak","id":5059100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5059100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak","html_url":"https://github.com/Uzlopak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Uzlopak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4748/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/4748/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
