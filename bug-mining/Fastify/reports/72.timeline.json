Would you be open to a PR to help with this? I was thinking:\n\nDocumentation - add some warnings/examples about returning {error} vs throwing, especially with async hooks\nTests - cover this scenario so it doesn't regress\nBug fix - make the error handling consistent between sync/async hooks\nThe thrown errors causing unhandled rejections is pretty nasty since it crashes the whole app instead of hitting the error handler.\n\nWhich would be most useful?

@Eomm—\n\nQuick recap of what I pushed:\n\n• **Docs PR** – clarified the “return `{ error }` instead of throw” pattern and added examples that show the difference between sync and async `preValidation`.\n\n• **Code PR** – wrapped the internal `validateSchema()` call in a small `try/catch` inside `preValidationCallback`.  \n  - If a custom validator throws after an async `preValidation` hook, we now forward the exception with `reply.send(err)`, so the default error-handler returns a 500 (or whatever a custom handler sets) instead of crashing the process.\n\n• **Regression test** – `test/async-prevalidation-validation-error.test.js` reproduces the original bug and confirms the fix.\n\nRan the full suite on Node 22: all 2 k-plus tests pass.\n\nBecause the new `try/catch` both fixes the unhandled rejection and ensures a proper 5xx response, it satisfies the “bug-fix + test” and “handle the error” bullets in one go—so I combined them into a single PR to keep the history clean. Let me know if you’d prefer it split out or want any

Description\r\n\r\nFixes inconsistent error handling between sync and async validation contexts when custom validators throw errors instead of returning `{error}` objects.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen using async preValidation hooks with custom validators, if the validator throws an error (instead of returning `{error}`), the error would not be caught by the error handler and would result in an unhandled promise rejection, potentially crashing the application.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency meant:\r\n- **Sync context**: Thrown errors were caught and handled properly by the error handler\r\n- **Async context**: Thrown errors became unhandled promise rejections\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nModified the `validateParam` function in `lib/validation.js` to wrap the `validatorFunction` call in a try-catch block. This ensures that synchronous throws are caught and returned as validation errors, making error handling consistent across both sync and async validation contexts.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- **lib/validation.js**: Added try-catch block around `validatorFunction` call in `validateParam`\r\n- **test/validation-error-handling.test.js**: Added test case to verify error handling consistency\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- ✅ All existing tests pass\r\n- ✅ New test specifically validates the fix for async preValidation + custom validator error scenarios\r\n- ✅ Covers the exact issue described in #6214\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nNone. This change maintains backward compatibility while fixing the error handling inconsistency.\r\n\r\nFixes #6214","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/6247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/6247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/comments/3207468404","html_url":"https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/6214#issuecomment-3207468404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastify/fastify/issues/6214","id":3207468404,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBCRpgs6_LhV0","user":{"login":"riyap03","id":196741725,"node_id":"U_kgDOC7oKXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196741725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03","html_url":"https://github.com/riyap03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/riyap03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-20T17:49:39Z","updated_at":"2025-08-20T17:49:39Z","body":"🌸 Hey @Eomm , I’m Riya. I was going through this issue and the linked PRs, and it seems most of the core fix is already done, but since the issue is still open I’d love to help out. Would it be useful if I add more test cases (like nested validators / larger payloads / async edge cases) or maybe expand the docs section so new users clearly see the { error } vs throw pattern? Happy to pick up whatever small piece would be most helpful here
