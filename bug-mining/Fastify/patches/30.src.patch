 1. All integrated CI services must be green, unless an agreement has been reached in the conversation about the exception, before a pull-request can be merged.
 1. Breaking changes or significant new features must be merged by a core member. Small pull-requests, e.g. documentation typo corrections, may be merged by any member with commit access.

 > ## Note
 > `.listen` binds to the local host, `localhost`, interface by default (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`, depending on the operating system configuration). If you are running Fastify in a container (Docker, [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), etc.), you may need to bind to `0.0.0.0`. Be careful when deciding to listen on all interfaces; it comes with inherent [security risks](https://web.archive.org/web/20170711105010/https://snyk.io/blog/mongodb-hack-and-secure-defaults/). 
 > See [the documentation](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Server.md#listen) for more information.
