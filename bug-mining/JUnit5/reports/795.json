Please provide us the version of JUnit you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). Please also mention where it's a regression compared to a previous version. -->\n\nJUnit supports public, protected and package-private test methods.\nJUnit supports test class inheritance.\nPublic and protected methods can be overridden in JLS sense. JUnit recognizes this situation and runs the test only once. In test source code this is indicated with `@Override` (in any reasonably managed project).\nPackage-private methods do not override each other in JLS sense. Both parent and child classes can declare `@Test void testFoo` method without any warning and without need for `@Override`.  It is expected that such test methods are considered unrelated by JUnit and both are run. Observed behavior is different: only the parent class test is run. The child test is silently ignored.\n\nUsing JUnit 6.0.0\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n```java\npackage a;\n\npublic abstract class TestParent {\n    @Test\n    void testParent()\n    {\n        System.out.println(\"TestParent.testParent\");\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testPublicNameCollision() {\n        System.out.println(\"TestParent.testPublicNameCollision\");\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void testPackagePrivateNameCollision() {\n        System.out.println(\"TestParent.testPackagePrivateNameCollision\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```java\npackage b;\n\npublic class TestChild extends a.TestParent {\n    @Test\n    void testChild() {\n        System.out.println(\"TestChild.testChild\");\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    @Override // clear source-level indication of test overriding. As expected, only the child test code is run.\n    public void testPublicNameCollision() {\n        System.out.println(\"TestChild.testPublicNameCollision\");\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    // no source-level indication of test overriding. This test code does not run, i.e. is silently skipped.\n    void testPackagePrivateNameCollision() {\n        System.out.println(\"TestChild.testPackagePrivateNameCollision\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>maven setup</summary>\n\n```xml\n    <dependencyManagement>\n        <dependencies>\n            <dependency>\n                <groupId>org.junit</groupId>\n                <artifactId>junit-bom</artifactId>\n                <version>6.0.0</version>\n                <type>pom</type>\n                <scope>import</scope>\n            </dependency>\n        </dependencies>\n    </dependencyManagement>\n\n    <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>\n            <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>\n            <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>\n            <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>\n            <scope>test</scope>\n        </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n`mvn test` prints\n\n```\nTestParent.testPackagePrivateNameCollision\nTestParent.testParent\nTestChild.testChild\nTestChild.testPublicNameCollision\n```\n\nNote that there is no `TestChild.testPackagePrivateNameCollision` in the output.\n\n\n## Context\n\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): junit-bom `6.0.0`\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/5098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/5098/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
