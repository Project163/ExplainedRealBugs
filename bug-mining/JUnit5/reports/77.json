Overview\r\nI believe I stumbled on a bug, my use case is the following:\r\n\r\nI have an abstract class containing tests and a constructor:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.Test;\r\n\r\npublic abstract class BugTest {\r\n\r\n    public BugTest(int x) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test() {}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that currently it's using the JUnit 4 `@Test` and a sub class extending this class providing the constructor argument: \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class SubBugTest extends BugTest {\r\n    public SubBugTest() {\r\n        super(2);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are various interactions with this construct between gradle and maven.  The outputs are shown below. The build.gradle and pom.xml are copies of the sample projects.\r\n\r\n## Running the tests through maven ##\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n T E S T S\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nApr 05, 2017 10:30:45 AM org.junit.jupiter.engine.discovery.JavaElementsResolver resolveClass\r\nWARNING: Class 'com.BugTest' could not be resolved\r\nRunning com.BugTest\r\nApr 05, 2017 10:30:45 AM org.junit.jupiter.engine.discovery.JavaElementsResolver resolveClass\r\nWARNING: Class 'com.BugTest' could not be resolved\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.026 sec <<< FAILURE! - in com.BugTest\r\ninitializationError  Time elapsed: 0.006 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.Exception: Test class should have exactly one public zero-argument constructor\r\n\r\nRunning com.SubBugTest\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0 sec - in com.SubBugTest\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nFailed tests: \r\n  BugTest »  Test class should have exactly one public zero-argument constructor\r\n\r\nTests run: 2, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Changing the annotation in the super class to org.junit.jupiter.api.Test the error goes away:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n T E S T S\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nApr 05, 2017 10:33:33 AM org.junit.jupiter.engine.discovery.JavaElementsResolver resolveClass\r\nWARNING: Class 'com.BugTest' could not be resolved\r\nRunning com.BugTest\r\nApr 05, 2017 10:33:33 AM org.junit.jupiter.engine.discovery.JavaElementsResolver resolveClass\r\nWARNING: Class 'com.BugTest' could not be resolved\r\nTests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.006 sec - in com.BugTest\r\nRunning com.SubBugTest\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.006 sec - in com.SubBugTest\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running with gradle ##\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning with the JUnit 4 `@Test` the results are:\r\n\r\nTest run finished after 20 ms\r\n[         2 containers found      ]\r\n[         0 containers skipped    ]\r\n[         2 containers started    ]\r\n[         0 containers aborted    ]\r\n[         2 containers successful ]\r\n[         0 containers failed     ]\r\n[         0 tests found           ]\r\n[         0 tests skipped         ]\r\n[         0 tests started         ]\r\n[         0 tests aborted         ]\r\n[         0 tests successful      ]\r\n[         0 tests failed          ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning it through gradle gives slightly different results, using the jupiter api `@Test` everything works beautifully, \r\n\r\n```\r\nTest run finished after 30 ms\r\n[         3 containers found      ]\r\n[         0 containers skipped    ]\r\n[         3 containers started    ]\r\n[         0 containers aborted    ]\r\n[         3 containers successful ]\r\n[         0 containers failed     ]\r\n[         1 tests found           ]\r\n[         0 tests skipped         ]\r\n[         1 tests started         ]\r\n[         0 tests aborted         ]\r\n[         1 tests successful      ]\r\n[         0 tests failed          ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Update `VintageTestEngine` so that it no longer attempts to execute abstract test classes but rather simply logs a warning when an abstract test class is _discovered_.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/769/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
