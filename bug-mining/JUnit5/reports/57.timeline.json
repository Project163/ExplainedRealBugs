Great stuff!\n\nI quite agree that we should make this functionality available to extensions. However, I'm not convinced that making `AnnotationUtils` a public API is the way to go. An alternative would be to add additional methods to `ExtensionContext`, e.g. `getAnnotations(Class<A extends Annotation>)`. The benefit would be more control over what is public API and what isn't. If we made parts of `AnnotationUtils` public API I'm pretty sure all of it will end up being used and we would have problems fixing even small bugs in it because it might break an extension.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/217633449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":653433575,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjUzNDMzNTc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/653433575","actor":{"login":"smoyer64","id":328333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64","html_url":"https://github.com/smoyer64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-05-07T12:53:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":653433576,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDY1MzQzMzU3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/653433576","actor":{"login":"smoyer64","id":328333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64","html_url":"https://github.com/smoyer64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-05-07T12:53:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/217633606","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/246#issuecomment-217633606","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/246","id":217633606,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNzYzMzYwNg==","user":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-0

way is fine with me ... and I certainly know the value of limited the surface area of the actual API (leaving more code as the proverbial \"black box\").  I think the spirit of the proposal by @nicolaiparlog would be met by exposing that functionality elsewhere.\n\nAs an aside, since (at the moment) the upREST framework's two primary goals are to create dynamic tests (the example above would actually produce four tests) and to execute the tests having already sent the HTTP request and received the HTTP response, most of the work is done behind the scenes as a means of satisfying one or more MethodParameterResolvers.  This involves a chaining of dependent resolvers where everything is dependent upon resolving the HTTP request even though many times it's not \"injected\" into the method call.\n\nIn any case, I guess what I'm really looking for is a little guidance on when using the ExtensionContext is more appropriate than the MethodInvocationContext.\n\nI'd also like to extend the use of the JUnit5 @API tag to the upREST extension(s).  Assuming JUnit5 users learn to \"honor\" the status of the API (using only maintained?), it seems like they'd understand or even expect the same from
