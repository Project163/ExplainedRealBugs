Status Quo\n\n`ClasspathScanner.processClassFileSafely()` _eagerly_ loads candidate classes without applying any filtering (other than the recently adding filtering for `package-info`). Consequently, every single class in the classpath is loaded even if it will never be needed for the current test plan.\n\nAlthough `ClassFilter.includeClassNamePattern(String)` can be used to filter out scanned classes, this unfortunately occurs after classpath scanning has occurred, meaning that even unused test classes are unnecessarily eagerly loaded.\n\nThis leads to unnecessary loading of classes, and since classes may have `static` initialization blocks, this also potentially leads to unnecessary execution of code.\n## Worst Case Scenario\n\nDue to the recently added support for scanning JARs in the classpath (see #399), the `ClasspathScanner` can now potentially _load every single class in the entire JVM_ if all classpath roots are scanned _and_ the user selects the default package as the base package from which to begin scanning.\n## Related Issues\n- #313 \n- #314 \n## Deliverables\n- [x] Apply filtering to classpath scanning candidates before loading the class (i.e., based solely on the file name of the `.class` file).\n  - [x] Supply class name patterns registered via `ClassFilter.includeClassNamePattern(String)` to the classpath scanning algorithms\n- [x] Change includeClassNamePattern(String pattern) to includeClassNamePatterns(String... patterns) and combine the patterns within a single filter using OR semantics\n- [x] Do the same for the `@IncludeClassNamePattern` annotation.\n- [x] Create follow-up ticket for M4 to delete deprecated `ClassFilter.includeClassNamePattern(String)` and `@IncludeClassNamePattern`\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
