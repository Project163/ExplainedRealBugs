I am running the same set of tests concurrently (this is a hard requirement for my application). I believe if the tests are run in a single threaded environment this issue does not happen. \r\n\r\nInitially I explored using a single `TestPlan` so that I could perform test discovery once and avoid the cost of having to do test discovery multiple times for the same test suite.

@marcphilipp, amazingly what you suggested with the `UniqueIdSelector` works. \r\n\r\nI followed your advice and collected unique ids from a discovered test plan. I was not sure which TestIdentifiers were needed so I collected all of them from starting at the root. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Initial Request\r\nfinal LauncherDiscoveryRequest request = LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder.request()\r\n                .selectors(\r\n                        selectPackage(\"com.oscar.samplelib\"),\r\n                        selectClass(SampleJavaClass.class)\r\n                ).filters(\r\n                        includeClassNamePatterns(\".*SampleJavaClass\")\r\n                ).\r\n                build();\r\n\r\n// Test plan to do discovery once and get unique ids \r\nfinal TestPlan testPlan = launcher.discover(request);\r\n\r\n// Collect all unique ids\r\nfinal List<UniqueIdSelector> selectors = testPlan.getRoots()\r\n            .stream()\r\n            .flatMap(testIdentifier ->\r\n                    Stream.concat(testPlan.getDescendants(testIdentifier)\r\n                            .stream(), Stream.of(testIdentifier))\r\n                            .map(x -> DiscoverySelectors.selectUniqueId(x.getUniqueId()))\r\n            ).collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n\r\n// Permanent request (for all subsequent calls)  \r\nlauncherDiscoveryRequest = LauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder.request()\r\n                .selectors(selectors)\r\n                .build();\r\n```\r\nAfter I followed the build steps again and reused the discovery request upon calling `Launcher.execute` the warnings no longer appear. \r\n\r\nMy only question is about the safety of the approach? I understand doing test discovery like this is not exactly the standard approach outlined in the JUnit documentation. \r\n\r\nDoing it the way you suggested has also netted a > 10% performance improvement in my limited performance testing done so far. It still remains to be seen how a single discovery request will actually fit into my application. Thank you again for showing me this :)
