Overview\r\n- (x ) **Bug report.**\r\n\r\nJunit5 Version: **5.1.1**\r\n\r\nWhen using the VerboseTreePrintingListener by setting the `--details` argument of the ConsoleLauncher to `verbose` the exceptions are not printed in the tree.\r\nWhen setting `--details` to `tree` they are. My expectation is that the `verbose` setting does print the exceptions and the stacktraces of exceptions thrown within a `beforeAll` method.\r\n\r\n### Acutal:\r\nExceptions thrown in the `beforeAll` method of extensions are not printed when using the `VerboseTreePrintingListener`\r\n\r\n### Expected:\r\nExceptions thrown from the `beforeAll` method of extensions shall be printed similar to when using the `TreePrintingListener`.\r\nThe full stacktrace should be printed.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\nIn the class `VerboseTreePrintingListener` move the following line from line 104 up before the `if` to line 97.\r\n```\r\ntestExecutionResult.getThrowable().ifPresent(t -> printDetail(Color.FAILED, \"caught\", readStackTrace(t)));\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Before\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n\tpublic void executionFinished(TestIdentifier testIdentifier, TestExecutionResult testExecutionResult) {\r\n\tif (testIdentifier.isContainer()) {\r\n\t\tLong creationMillis = frames.pop();\r\n\t\tprintVerticals(theme.end());\r\n\t\tprintf(Color.CONTAINER, \" %s\", testIdentifier.getDisplayName());\r\n\t\tprintf(NONE, \" finished after %d ms.%n\", System.currentTimeMillis() - creationMillis);\r\n\t\treturn;\r\n\t}\r\n\ttestExecutionResult.getThrowable().ifPresent(t -> printDetail(Color.FAILED, \"caught\", readStackTrace(t)));\r\n\tprintDetail(NONE, \"duration\", \"%d ms%n\", System.currentTimeMillis() - executionStartedMillis);\r\n\tString status = theme.status(testExecutionResult) + \" \" + testExecutionResult.getStatus();\r\n\tprintDetail(Color.valueOf(testExecutionResult), \"status\", \"%s%n\", status);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- After\r\n```\r\npublic void executionFinished(TestIdentifier testIdentifier, TestExecutionResult testExecutionResult) {\r\n\ttestExecutionResult.getThrowable().ifPresent(t -> printDetail(Color.FAILED, \"caught\", readStackTrace(t)));\r\n\tif (testIdentifier.isContainer()) {\r\n\t\tLong creationMillis = frames.pop();\r\n\t\tprintVerticals(theme.end());\r\n\t\tprintf(Color.CONTAINER, \" %s\", testIdentifier.getDisplayName());\r\n\t\tprintf(NONE, \" finished after %d ms.%n\", System.currentTimeMillis() - creationMillis);\r\n\t\treturn;\r\n\t}\r\n\tprintDetail(NONE, \"duration\", \"%d ms%n\", System.currentTimeMillis() - executionStartedMillis);\r\n\tString status = theme.status(testExecutionResult) + \" \" + testExecutionResult.getStatus();\r\n\tprintDetail(Color.valueOf(testExecutionResult), \"status\", \"%s%n\", status);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
