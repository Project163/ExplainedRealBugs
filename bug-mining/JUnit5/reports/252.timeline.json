, @marcphilipp @sbrannen, thank you guys for the quick answers!\r\nI'm really appreciate that you will add this information to the JavaDoc and to the user-guide as well.\r\n\r\nBut I still have only one question, do you think that this behavior and I'm talking only about callback methods from extensions **should be like this**? I have one example when I've faced it and why I actually raised this ticket.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nWe have `EnvVariablesExtension` which is changing environment variables in the `beforeEach` callback method and restoring them to original ones in the `afterEach` callback method.\r\nI've tried to test `EnvVariablesExtension` with the second extension. Let's name it `AcceptanceExtension`  and, of course, this extension is saving original environment variables in the `beforeEach` callback and asserting that environment variables which was fetched in `afterEach` callback method equals original environment variables. \r\n\r\nOrder of the extensions is \r\n\r\n1. `AcceptanceExtension` \r\n2. `EnvVariablesExtension`\r\n\r\nAs you already understood, `beforeEach` part works fine, but the second one `afterEach` part does not work, because `AcceptanceExtension` is called first and assertion failed. \r\n\r\nMy question is, why you've chosen this approach for execution order of callback extension's methods?\r\nWhy not just calling every callback extension's methods in that order which you've provided in the `@ExtendWith({AcceptanceExtension.class, EnvVariablesExtension.class})` annotation?\r\n```\r\nAcceptanceExtension.beforeEach -> \r\nEnvVariablesExtension.beforeEach -> \r\nTest's body -> \r\nAcceptanceExtension.beforeEach -> \r\nEnvVariablesExtension.beforeEach\r\n```\r\nThank you in advance.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/427604020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"apodkutin","id":2204430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDQ0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2204430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin","html_url":"https://github.com/apodkutin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodkutin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1888733925,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4ODczMzkyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1888733925","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-06T20:30:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1888733926,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4ODg3MzM5MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1888733926","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-06T20:30:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1888733927,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg4ODczMzkyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1888733927","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-06T20:30:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1888733928,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFd
