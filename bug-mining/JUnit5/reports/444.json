JUnit Jupiter, the `public` modifier is optional in test classes and methods.\r\n\r\nI see test classes in JUnit, Spring projects, etc apply this no `public` modifier pattern.\r\nOnce I get used to this style, it feels very redundant when I encounter tests that have `public` all over.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a good practice to follow.\r\n\r\nHowever, in JUnit documentation, I only find this line regarding the `public` modifier:\r\n\r\n>  Test classes, test methods, and lifecycle methods are not required to be public, but they must not be private. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be great if JUnit documentation mentions that leaving off the `public` modifier is preferred unless visibility is required. (e.g. base class shared by different packages)\r\n\r\nI understand this is a bit of _opinionated_ aspect, but it would be nice to mention the principle of _[\"less is more\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55215949/why-junit-5-default-access-modifier-changed-to-package-private/55230350#55230350)_ in the documentation.\r\nSo that, a person like me can encourage this pattern to other devs with the backup of JUnit good practice.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2626/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
