am using JUnit 5 RC2 to execute the following simple test case, both with Maven and Gradle:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage io.github.bonigarcia;\r\n\r\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nclass PlayingWithReportingTest {\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void successTest() {\r\n        assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void failureTest() {\r\n        assertTrue(false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void errorTest() {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"This test is broken!\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running with Maven, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> mvn clean test\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n...\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n T E S T S\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nRunning io.github.bonigarcia.PlayingWithReportingTest\r\nTests run: 3, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.106 sec <<< FAILURE! - in io.github.bonigarcia.PlayingWithReportingTest\r\nerrorTest()  Time elapsed: 0.021 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: This test is broken!\r\n        at io.github.bonigarcia.PlayingWithReportingTest.errorTest(PlayingWithReportingTest.java:37)\r\n\r\nfailureTest()  Time elapsed: 0.003 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:\r\n

broken!\r\n  PlayingWithReportingTest.failureTest:32\r\n\r\nTests run: 3, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which I think is incorrect, since I would expect that 1 test (`failureTest`) is declared as failure (assertion error), other one (`errorTest`) is declared and error (exception in the test), and the other one as success. Instead, the Maven output says there are 2 failures.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when running the same test with Gradle:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> gradle clean test\r\n:clean\r\n...\r\n\r\nFailures (2):\r\n  JUnit Jupiter:PlayingWithReportingTest:errorTest()\r\n    MethodSource [className = 'io.github.bonigarcia.PlayingWithReportingTest', methodName = 'errorTest', methodParameterTypes = '']\r\n    => java.lang.RuntimeException: This test is broken!\r\n  JUnit Jupiter:PlayingWithReportingTest:failureTest()\r\n    MethodSource [className = 'io.github.bonigarcia.PlayingWithReportingTest', methodName = 'failureTest', methodParameterTypes = '']\r\n    => org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:\r\n\r\nTest run finished after 128 ms\r\n[         2 containers found      ]\r\n[         0 containers skipped    ]\r\n[         2 containers started    ]\r\n[         0 containers aborted    ]\r\n[         2 containers successful ]\r\n[         0 containers failed     ]\r\n[         3 tests found           ]\r\n[         0 tests skipped         ]\r\n[         3 tests started         ]\r\n[         0 tests aborted         ]\r\n[         1 tests successful      ]\r\n[         2 tests failed          ]\r\n\r\n:junitPlatformTest FAILED\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilaryly, there are 2 tests declared as failure and besides, the output says there that 2 containers found, but if I'm not wrong there should be just one, since there is only one test class in the project.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or I am misinterpreting something here?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. Keep up with great work!\r\n\r\nPS: Source code [here](https://github.com/bonigarcia/mastering-junit5/tree/master/junit5-reporting).","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
