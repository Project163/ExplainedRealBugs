Discussed in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/discussions/2909\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **skohlmann** May  6, 2022</sup>\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nthe [`@Order`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/r5.8.2/junit-jupiter-api/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/Order.java) annotation is marked as `EXPERIMENTAL` where the type annotation value `OrderAnnotation` implementation is not marked as `EXPERIMENTAL`. So I guess, it‘s stable. The documentation of `OrderAnnotation` also refers to `@Order.` \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if `OrderAnnotation` implicitly takes the API state of `@Order`, this indirection is semantically difficult to detect. This also in view of the fact that `@Order` has been in the `EXPERIMENTAL` state for many versions, and within this time period certainly\r\n\r\n1. a realization with regard to 👍 or 👎 has arisen.\r\n2. the use in projects is certainly established, after 4 minor releases.\r\n\r\nI would be happy if the situation is clarified by the team in the next minor release. Whereby I plead for `@Order` to be transferred to the state `STABLE`.\r\n\r\nHave fun :-) \r\n\r\n-sascha </div>","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
