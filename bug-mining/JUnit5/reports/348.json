recently been fiddling with Junit Jupiter in order to migrate some of our custom Junit 4 runners into appropriate Jupiter extensions.\r\n\r\nDue to different reasons we need to write custom `ExecutionCondition` which would enable or disable running of certain tests under different JREs. We can't use the `@DisabledOnJre` feature since we are using a `@TestTemplate` which based on the passed information would later on decide if it can execute the test on the current JRE.\r\n\r\nIn our case we are running some compiler tests with Eclipse JDT and Javac. When running under Java 11 we need to disable the Eclipse JDT tests. We are using a template since the same test is executed twice, once with Eclipse and once with Javac.\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to do\r\n\r\n```java\r\n static final JRE CURRENT_VERSION;\r\n\r\n    static {\r\n        JRE currentVersion = JRE.OTHER;\r\n        for ( JRE jre : JRE.values() ) {\r\n            if ( jre.isCurrentVersion() ) {\r\n                currentVersion = jre;\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        CURRENT_VERSION = currentVersion;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be better if this can be provided by the `JRE` class itself. for example `JRE.currentVersion()`.\r\n\r\nIf the JUnit team is OK with such addition to the `JRE` API I can provide a PR for adding it\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
