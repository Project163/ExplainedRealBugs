[description](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertTimeoutPreemptively(java.time.Duration,org.junit.jupiter.api.function.Executable)) in the various `Assertions.assertTimeoutPreemptively` methods is vague. It states\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, execution of the `executable` will be preemptively aborted if the timeout is exceeded.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what is meant by \"aborted\". Looking at the source code of both JUnit and JDK, I can see what happens is that the thread is interrupted. I suggest that the description be changed to something like\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, it will be attempted to preemptively abort execution of the `executable` by calling `interrupt()` on the thread if the timeout is exceeded. If the `executable` does not return when interrupted, the thread will be left running.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
