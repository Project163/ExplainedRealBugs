executing in parallel using a fixed number of threads, when several tests attempt to acquire a read/write lock against the `GLOBAL_KEY`, threads are likely to be assigned in a sub-optimal manner.\r\n\r\nThis issue was originally reported as https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/2910. The key to this issue is the low max-pool size. This is a common, if crude, way to limit the number of active web drivers.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/mpkorstanje/junit5-scheduling for a minimal reproducer.\r\n\r\n```\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=concurrent\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=3\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.max-pool-size=3\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Isolated\r\nclass SerialATest {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void simulateWebDriver() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Serial A: \" + Thread.currentThread().getName() );\r\n        Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n   ... Several tests\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Isolated\r\nclass SerialBTest {\r\n\r\n   ... Copy of SerialATest\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ParallelTest {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void simulateWebDriver() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Parallel: \" + Thread.currentThread().getName() );\r\n        Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ... Several tests\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting these tests will likely result in an output similar to this:\r\n\r\n```log\r\nParallel: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2\r\nParallel: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2\r\nParallel: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2\r\nParallel: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2\r\nParallel: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2\r\nSerial A: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3\r\nSerial A: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3\r\nSerial B: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1\r\nSerial B: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output implies that  `worker-1` and `worker-3` are waiting to acquire the `ExclusiveResource.GLOBAL_KEY`, leaving only `worker-2` to process the parallel section on its own. Once done, the other workers can then acquire the lock in turn. In the ideal scenario, the parallel section would be executed with the maximum number of workers.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Jupiter: 5.10.3\r\n - Java 17\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\nTo be determined.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3928/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
