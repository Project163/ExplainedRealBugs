[JUnit Jupiter does not guarantee that the number of concurrently executing tests will not exceed the configured parallelism](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution-config). The advice is to provide a custom [`ParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.platform.engine/org/junit/platform/engine/support/hierarchical/ParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy.html). And through https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/2792 it is now possible to configure whether or not the pool should be saturated.\r\n\r\nHowever implementing a custom strategy to replicate the behaviour of the existing `fixed` or `dynamic` strategy with saturation is non-trivial. On the other hand, ensuring a maximum number of concurrent tests is a common need e.g: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2545, https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1675, https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1858, https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10113, https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/2512, https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/2602.\r\n\r\nWe can stream line the experience for end-users by providing `*.dynamic.saturate` and `*.fixed.saturate` properties. When set to `true` the `DefaultParallelExecutionConfiguration.getSaturatePredicate` would return `__ -> true` and `null` otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Update `DefaultParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy` to read `*.dynamic.saturate` and `*.fixed.saturate` properties.\r\n- [x] Update the documentation to explain this.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3026/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3026/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
