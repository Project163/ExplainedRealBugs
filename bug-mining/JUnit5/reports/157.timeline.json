Overview\r\n\r\nCommit 77c0f9a5002c52ca0f9d363a77a674137f5ae66e accidentally introduced a Maven `compile` scope dependency on the `apiguardian-api` artifact in all published JUnit artifacts; whereas, the dependency should **ideally** be listed as `optional` in the generated Maven POMs since there are in fact zero runtime dependencies on `@API` within published JUnit artifacts.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-178888\r\n- #1064 \r\n- #1105\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove `compile` dependency on `apiguardian-api` in generated Maven POMs.\r\n- [x] Consider including an `optional` dependency on `apiguardian-api` in generated Maven POMs.\r\n  - AFAIK, it is not possible to generate an `optional` dependency with the standard Gradle infrastructure. For that we will likely have to use a third-party tool such as the [propdeps-plugin](https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/propdeps-plugin) from the Spring team.\r\n- ❌ Consider backporting this change to `1.0.1`, `5.0.1`, and `4.12.0.1` releases.\r\n  - Team decision: do not backport unless such branches are created due to other needs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1065/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/338001038","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1105#issuecomment-338001038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1105","id":338001038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODAwMTAzOA==","user":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-19T18:45:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T18:45:41Z","body":"Team
