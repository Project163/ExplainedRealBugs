in the reference documentation in the [Configuring the JUnit Gradle Plugin](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build-gradle-junit-configure) section exists this example:\r\n\r\n`logManager 'org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager'`\r\n\r\nIs not clear:\r\n\r\n* If that `org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager` is mandatory or not\r\n* If we are able to change to `logback`, if yes, what is the value?\r\n\r\nI am working with `Jenkins`, when I execute the test for a module, my `@Test` pass but I get\r\n\r\n```\r\n:junit-01-infrastructure:junitPlatformTestCould not load Logmanager \"org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager\"\r\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager\r\n\tat java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)\r\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)\r\n\tat sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:338)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have in my classpath `SLF4J` and `Logback`, I did a research for the latter and there is no nothing similar than `LogManager` but the former has [org.apache.log4j.LogManager](https://www.slf4j.org/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/LogManager.html) (different package), thus if I use now:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//logManager 'org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager'\r\nlogManager 'org.apache.log4j.LogManager'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen again the `@Test` pass but I get now:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:junit-01-infrastructure:junitPlatformTestCould not load Logmanager \"org.apache.log4j.LogManager\"\r\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.log4j.LogManager\r\n\tat java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381)\r\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)\r\n```\r\nThus I am not able to see the `Gradle Report` (the `reports` directory within the `build` directory), but I know that all the `@Test` pass due the `JUnit` plugin in `Jenkins`\r\n\r\nIf I comment both lines\r\n\r\n```\r\n//logManager 'org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager'\r\n//logManager 'org.apache.log4j.LogManager'\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe `reports` directory within the `build` directory does not appear\r\n\r\nNot sure how handle correctly this situation.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n-
