was working on [JUnit-pioneer #131](https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/131), which is about making some extensions thread safe, e.g. due using the `@ResourceLock` annotation.\r\n \r\nFor testing purposes I set the execution to the most parallel execution possible (Test classes and methods inside each class are executed in parallel):\r\n\r\n```properties\r\n#  Enable parallel execution of JUnit tests\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true\r\n# Run all tests methods inside a class in parallel as default\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=concurrent\r\n# Run all tests classes in parallel as default\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default=concurrent\r\n# Explicit set the execution strategy to dynamic (default strategy)\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=dynamic\r\n# Explicit set the factor of dynamic strategy to its default value \r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.factor=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that by current default the `TestEngineKit` also picks up those settings for parallel execution(_, which results in a large amount of flaky tests, when you verify your tests using the engine kit_).\r\n@marcphilipp thinks this is unexpected, when using EngineTestKit and JUnit should not do this be default. So he [asked](https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/131#issuecomment-622953047) me to open an issue for further investigation and decision.\r\n\r\nNote: He also mentioned that a workaround for the current behavior is so disable the parallel execution at the `TestEngineKit` using `.configurationParameter(\"junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled\", \"false\")`.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
