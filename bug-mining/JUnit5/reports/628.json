to [a bug in Kafka](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-17121), we currently see several warnings in our build that look like this:\r\n`Discovered 2 'junit-platform.properties' configuration files in the classpath; only the first will be used.`\r\n\r\nWhile this is certainly true, I had to write code to find out what's actually going on and pinpoint the issue to Kafka.\r\n\r\nThis could have been prevented if the warning message would have also included the multiple URLs.\r\n\r\nThis is not a big thing but a low-hanging fruit to slightly enhance the user experience in such a situation.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3898/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
