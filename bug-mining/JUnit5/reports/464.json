Overview\r\n\r\nHaving `autoCloseArguments` default to `true` is a breaking change for arguments that are shared between parameterized test invocations.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring Framework test suite, we have three `@ParameterizedTest` methods (in `PathMatchingUrlHandlerMappingTests` and `ClientHttpConnectorTests`) that hang indefinitely while running against JUnit 5.8 snapshots.\r\n\r\nDeclaring `@ParameterizedTest(autoCloseArguments = false)` solves the problem, but this is technically a regression and, more importantly, the average user will not even know where to begin debugging such failures.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\nDocument that `autoCloseArguments` in `@ParameterizedTest` is a potentially breaking change in:\r\n\r\n- [x] Javadoc\r\n- [x] Release Notes\r\n- [x] User
