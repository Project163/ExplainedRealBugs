Overview\n\nCurrently, the target of `@ParameterizedTest` is constrained to methods. When creating technology compatibility kits, it would be awesome to be able to apply this (or a similar annotation) to the test class so that all tests in that class are parameterized the same

feature2() { ... }\n}\n```\n\nSomething like:\n\n```java\n@ParameterizedTest\n@ArgumentSource(...)\nclass MyTest {\n   @Test // ?\n   void feature1() { ... }\n   \n   @Test\n   void feature2() { ...

using TestTemplate, JUnit will perform executions grouped by the test method.  For example, if I have a test class that defines 2 test methods (m1, m2) as TestTemplate and provide 2 invocation contexts (c1, c2) - JUnit will perform this in the following order:\r\n\r\n````\r\n    * m1:c1\r\n    * m1:c2\r\n    * m2:c1\r\n    * m2:c2\r\n````\r\nBut what I really need is:\r\n\r\n````\r\n    * m1:c1\r\n    * m2:c1\r\n    * m1:c2\r\n    * m2:c2\r\n````\r\n\r\nMy use case is that the invocation context describes a particular database schema layout.  So c1 and c2 define the same schema, but slightly differently (one adds extra columns to a given table and defoines others).  Given that JUnit wants to group these invocations by method (iterating the context within that) we are forced to recreate that schema before each invocation.  Effectively this becomes:\r\n\r\n````\r\n    * create schema1 (c1) \r\n    * run m1\r\n    * drop schema1\r\n    * create schema2 (c2) \r\n    * run m2\r\n    * drop schema2\r\n    * create schema1

Overview\r\n\r\nI started to write some dynamic tests, and now it would be handy to reuse some `@ParameterizedTest` functionality I already implemented.\r\n\r\nTake a look at this example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @ParameterizedTest(name = \"{0}\")\r\n  @ArgumentsSource(ClassArgumentsProvider.class)\r\n  @TestFactory\r\n  Stream<DynamicTest> apiGuards(Class<?> c) {\r\n    return ApiGuardHelper.checkGuards(() -> EnhancedRandom.random(c));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should generate some dynamic tests for each class found in the package, but sadly the `@ParameterizedTest` annotation is not supported with a `@TestFactory` method.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #871\r\n-

regard to generic support for iteratively executing an entire container (test class), something like `@RepeatedContainer` would be very useful for frameworks such as Spring.\r\n\r\nThinking out

I am concerned that `@ParameterizedTest` be experimental, it means that it would be disappear. Am I correct? If yes, how would be replaced? It would be complicated for many Test classes, consider the long refactor.\r\n2. `@MethodSource` can works with either `data` or `dataa` methods, thus the documentation should explain if is mandatory use a method returning a `Stream` or not.\r\n3. For `@MethodSource` is mandatory use it together with `@ParameterizedTest` and not with `@Test`, if the latter is used, I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolutionException: No ParameterResolver registered for parameter [com.manuel.jordan.domain.Persona arg0] in executable [void com.manuel.jordan.repository.jdbc.PersonaJdbcRepositoryTest.saveOneTest(com.manuel.jordan.domain.Persona)].\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.engine.execution.ExecutableInvoker.resolveParameter(ExecutableInvoker.java:191)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.engine.execution.ExecutableInvoker.resolveParameters(ExecutableInvoker.java:174)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.engine.execution.ExecutableInvoker.resolveParameters(ExecutableInvoker.java:135)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.engine.execution.ExecutableInvoker.invoke(ExecutableInvoker.java:116)\r\n\tat \r\n```\r\nConsider add a new feature about use `@Test` working with and without `@MethodSource`. It because consider the complications about do a migration of `@Test` to `@ParameterizedTest` from many Test classes according JUnit 4 to 5 working in a Parameterized scenario\r\n\r\n4. Even when is possible reduce some code (see the commented lines in **Beta**), seems is mandatory add a parameter for each test method, when `@MethodSource` and `@ParameterizedTest` are used. In some way would be verbose, but I am OK with this new approach until some point. Just curious if `@MethodSource` (or a new annotation variation) would be added to work with a constructor and in this way avoid add a new parameter for each test method. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        @MethodSource(\"data\")\r\n\tpublic PersonaJdbcRepositoryTest(Persona persona){\r\n\t\tthis.persona = persona;\t\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\t@Sql(scripts={\"classpath:/com/manuel/jordan/db/delete.sql\"})\r\n\tvoid saveOneTest(){\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPractically the same approach that `@Parameters` in JUnit 4. I hope you see my point\r\n\r\nThanks in advance by your support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kiryl-naurotski","id":32316230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzE2MjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32316230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski","html_url":"https://github.com/kiryl-naurotski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiryl-naurotski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-08T13:21:13Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T13:21:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1411","id":321178738,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjExNzg3Mzg=","number":1411,"title":"Add

Overview\r\n\r\nAs requested in issue #681 (```Introduce junit-platform-suite-api module```), the annotations used for test discovery and selection in the ```JUnitPlatform``` runner have been refactored into the ```junit-platform-suite-api```.  This allows a purely JUnit 5 test suite to be defined declaratively, though it currently requires an alternate engine (as opposed to an extension).\r\n\r\nThis issue describes a generalized JUnit platform suite that's suitable for the Jupiter test engine as well as any others that might be chosen.  It's my opinion that unit tests rarely require test suites, but it becomes far more common when integration, system and acceptance tests are being executed due to the very common integration with external systems that should only be initialized before the entire test run.  Examples of resources that can be safely shared among tests are database connection pools (or really any connection pool), test frameworks that require significant set-up time (e.g. GWT test suites eliminate 20s of HtmlUnit set-up time for each test - it's only incurred once at the beginning of each suite).\r\n\r\nThe examples shown below indicate how the ```@Suite``` annotation can be used in conjunction with those already in the ```junit-platform-suite-api``` module.  Originally I'd also defined the ```@BeforeSuite``` and ```@AfterSuite``` annotations but after further consideration decided that since suites are really just an arbitrary collection of indeterminately nested test containers, it would be better if the ```@BeforeAll``` and ```@AfterAll``` annotations were contextual (nested in the same way the hierarchy would be presented in the test tree).  I've also assumed that these annotations no longer require the static modifier as discussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nImagine if you will a set of acceptance tests that have a custom reporting mechanism that should be configured for the entire test run.  Included within this outer suite is a set of tests that require a database connection pool and a different set of tests that require an LDAP connection pool.  The top-level suite definition for the acceptance tests might look something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Suite\r\n@IncludeEngines(\"jupiter-engine\") // not required if there's only one engine on the classpath\r\n@IncludeClassNamePatterns(\".*AcceptanceTestSuite$\")\r\npublic class AcceptanceTestSuite {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeAll\r\n    void setUp() {\r\n        ... // code to set-up custom test reporting\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterAll() {\r\n    void tearDown() {\r\n        ... // code to tear-down custom test reporting\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two notable characteristics of this test suite:\r\n\r\n1. It specifies which engine will be used for the entire container/test hierarchy (assuming there is more than one).\r\n2. It includes potentially numerous other test suites as sub-containers which can each have their own contextual set-up and tear-down.\r\n\r\nA child suite for tests that require a database connection pool might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Suite\r\n@IncludeTags({\"integration\", \"database\"})\r\n@IncludeClassNamePatterns(\".*IT$\")\r\npublic class DatabaseAcceptanceTestSuite {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeAll\r\n    void setUp() {\r\n        ... // code to set-up the database connection pool\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterAll() {\r\n    void tearDown() {\r\n        ... // code to tear-down the database connection pool\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf run under Maven, test classes that end in \"IT\" would be run using the ```maven-failsafe-plugin```.  If there are other classes of integration tests not run during acceptance testing it would also be necessary to make sure the acceptance test classes were not run (as they'd fail without the suite's set-up methods).\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\nProvide the means for arbitrarily nested, declarative tests suites in JUnit 5 including the execution of set-up and tear-down methods\r\n\r\n##

want here, `codeQuality` runs twice, once for each plugin class list (this works). `hasSourceSets` runs *4* times. The `@Nested` runs twice for each plugin class, and then `hasSourceSets` would run twice fore each of those with each extension given. If this is currently possible perhaps an example could be added to the docs. If it isn't possible, I think being able to do this somehow would be a great feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"xenoterracide","id":5517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide","html_url":"https://github.com/xenoterracide","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenoterracide/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T19:49:55Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T19:49:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1457","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1457/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1457/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1457/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1457","id":330008065,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzAwMDgwNjU=","number":1457,"title":"Deprecate
