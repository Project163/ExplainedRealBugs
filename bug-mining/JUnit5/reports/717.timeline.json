Overview\n\nA change in 5.13.0 led to inner classes being discovered during class\npath scanning which caused them to be added to their parent descriptors\nbefore their sibling test methods. This made the order of execution in\nclasses containing nested test classes dependent on how they were\ndiscovered.\n\nThe change in this commit avoids inner classes from being discovered\nduring classpath scanning so they won't be added earlier than their\nsibling test methods again.\n\nResolves #4600.\n\n---\n\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License

Overview\n\nIn order to validate them, classpath scanning was changed to find them\nin 5.13.0. However, that caused `@Nested` classes to be added to their\nparent descriptors before their sibling test methods. This made the\norder of execution in classes containing nested test classes dependent\non how they were discovered unless a `MethodOrderer` was configured in\nwhich case `MethodOrderingVisitor` ensured test methods came before\n`@Nested` test classes on the same level.\n\nThis commit changes `MethodOrderingVisitor` to also ensure this\nordering constraint in case no `MethodOrderer` is configured.\n\nResolves #4600.\n\n---\n\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License

in:\n\n```\ntest 1\ntest 2\ntest 3\n```\n\nSelect all test classes (including nested test classes) via classpath scanning like this:\n\n```java\n@Suite\n@SelectPackages(\"example\")\nclass NestedTestsSuite {\n}\n```\n\nRunning that suite results in:\n\n```\ntest 3\ntest 2\ntest 1\n```\n\nThus, the tests are executed in inverted order, and I've updated the title of this issue to reflect that.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/2927274239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17914461546,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAbwRH864_LNbzwAAAAQryP1q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/17914461546","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-01T14:07:30Z","rename":{"from":"`@Nested`
