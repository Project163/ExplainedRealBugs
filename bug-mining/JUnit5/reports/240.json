Overview\r\n\r\nIDEs and build tools use the `org.junit.platform.launcher.Launcher` interface to discover and run tests. However, the interface does not provide a means to run rests with a previous discovered test plan. This results, at least for IntelliJ, in that test engines will be asked twice to come up with the same test plan. See: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-203173 for details.\r\n\r\nSince discovery often involves classpath scanning this can be a real performance hit in large projects.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd interface method `void execute(TestPlan)` to the interface to allow reuse of already discovered test plan.\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\n\r\nIf the suggestion above is difficult to realize. Cache a discovered test plan that results from an identical `LaunchDiscoveryRequest` object.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce a new `void execute(TestPlan)` method in the `Launcher` API.\r\n  - [x] Implement appropriate tests.\r\n- [x] Add checks to `TestPlan` that throw an exception if the _user_ attempts to modify the state of the `TestPlan` after discovery has completed.\r\n  - [x] For the above, we will need some form of _state_ within the `TestPlan` to track if discovery has completed.\r\n  - [x] Implement appropriate tests.\r\n- [x] Document in User Guide.\r\n- [x] Document in Release Notes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
