I agree that it's kind of disadvantage that it's executed for each test class, though I did \"lazy initialization\" ex: \r\n```java\r\nif (my_report == null) {\r\n    //perfom init here\r\n}\r\nreturn my_report\r\n``` \r\nand I don't care about executing per class

don't get me wrong, your snipped helped me to solve the issue, so props for that. But as it is it does not work as expected (executed only 1 after all tests) in case, when you have more than 1 test class. And if you don't have more than 1 test class `afterAll` would the the trick way better.\r\n\r\nAs I said, thanks for the snippet!
