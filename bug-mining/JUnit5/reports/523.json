Overview\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2191#issuecomment-1297746235, prior to Jupiter 5.9 if an overloaded method that accepts arguments also met the criteria for a factory method (based on the return type), that method would _not_ have been considered a factory method.\r\n\r\nHowever, as of Jupiter 5.9 (including 5.9.1) such an overloaded method will be considered a _candidate_ factory method. Consequently, if that method is an overload for the intended `@MethodSource` factory method an exception will be thrown stating that multiple competing factory methods were discovered.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n`WorkingTests` succeeds. `FailingTests` fails because it extends `Base`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage example;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.stream.Stream;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Nested;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.MethodSource;\r\n\r\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;\r\n\r\nclass MethodSourceFactoryTests {\r\n\r\n\t@Nested\r\n\tclass WorkingTests {\r\n\r\n\t\t@ParameterizedTest\r\n\t\t@MethodSource(\"data\")\r\n\t\tvoid test(String value) {\r\n\t\t\tassertEquals(1, value.length());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// legitimate factory method.\r\n\t\tstatic Stream<String> data() {\r\n\t\t\treturn Stream.of(\"a\", \"b\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Nested\r\n\tclass FailingTests extends Base {\r\n\r\n\t\t@ParameterizedTest\r\n\t\t@MethodSource(\"data\")\r\n\t\tvoid test(String value) {\r\n\t\t\tassertEquals(1, value.length());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// legitimate factory method.\r\n\t\tstatic Stream<String> data() {\r\n\t\t\treturn Stream.of(\"a\", \"b\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tstatic class Base {\r\n\r\n\t\t// Jupiter 5.8: not considered a factory method.\r\n\t\t// Jupiter 5.9: considered a factory method.\r\n\t\tstatic Stream<String> data(String first) {\r\n\t\t\treturn Stream.of(first);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #2191 \r\n- #2993\r\n- #3001\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Determine if there are any improvements that can be made and otherwise document the status quo (including workarounds).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
