Overview\n\n`TestClassPredicatesTests.StandaloneTestClasses.recursiveHierarchies()` currently passes when run with the Gradle build or in IntelliJ IDEA; however, it fails in Eclipse IDE.\n\nSpecifically, the assertion on the first line of that test method does not throw an exception in Eclipse.\n\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/3c5b457564d559fb0f396d7f303f8effe291daa3/jupiter-tests/src/test/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/discovery/predicates/TestClassPredicatesTests.java#L221-L224\n\nThe reason is twofold:\n\n1. `ReflectionUtils.visitNestedClasses(...)` short-circuits the search algorithm once a `@Nested` test class has been detected.\n2. The order in which nested classes are returned from `java.lang.Class.getDeclaredClasses()` apparently differs between the OpenJDK/IntelliJ compilers and the Eclipse compiler.\n\nThe result is that `ReflectionUtils.detectInnerClassCycle()` only gets invoked on nested classes until the first `@Nested` class is encountered (or until there are no more nested classes to inspect).\n\nThus, if a `@Nested` class is detected **before** a nested class with a class hierarchy cycle, the cycle is not detected/reported.\n\nIn Eclipse, if you rename `TestClassPredicatesTests.TestCases.OuterClass.InnerClass` to `TestClassPredicatesTests.TestCases.OuterClass.XXXInnerClass`, the test then passes because `TestClassPredicatesTests.TestCases.OuterClass.RecursiveInnerClass` is encountered first, resulting in the expected `JUnitException` stating that it \"detected [a] cycle in [the] inner class hierarchy\".\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #242 \n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
