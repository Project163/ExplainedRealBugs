is related to #636 but takes a different approach: instead of upgrading testcontainers core to JUnit 5 APIs, this introduces a new module containing a JUnit 5 extension that uses testcontainers core.\r\n\r\nStatic fields are shared among test methods (started only once and stopped at the end), while instance fields are started and stopped for every method. This approach has the advantage that it is relatively easy to implement. However, the downside of this is, that shared containers can't be used inside of `@Nested` test cases since these must not be declared as static inner classes and hence can not have static fields.\r\n\r\nFeedback welcome @kiview, @sormuras, @nicolaiparlog,

Overview\r\n\r\nA comment in [SPR-15366](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-15366?focusedCommentId=157903&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-157903) has made me aware of a potential bug in JUnit Jupiter's handling of `@BeforeEach` methods with regard to the `ExtensionContext` supplied to a `ParameterResolver` registered for an enclosing test class when executing a test method within a `@Nested` test class.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Jupiter invokes a `@BeforeEach` method in the enclosing class using the `ExtensionContext` for a `@Test` method in a `@Nested` class. The same may be true for other lifecycle callback methods as well, but I have not investigated that.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the cause of this behavior is due to a combination of how `ClassTestDescriptor.invokeMethodInExtensionContext(Method, ExtensionContext, ExtensionRegistry)` and `TestMethodTestDescriptor.invokeBeforeEachMethods(JupiterEngineExecutionContext)` operate. The latter invokes each synthesized `BeforeEachMethodAdapter` using the `ExtensionContext` for the current test method instead of supplying the `ExtensionContext` for the context in which the method is declared. Consequently, if a `ParameterResolver` is asked to resolve a parameter for a `@BeforeEach` method in an enclosing class and the resolver needs the test class (or information tied to the test class via annotations) to resolve the parameter, then the resolver gets the test class for the currently executing `@Nested` test class when invoking `extensionContext.getRequiredTestClass()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this _behavior_ does not appear to apply to the invocation of `TestInstancePostProcessor` implementations as can be seen in `TestInstancePostProcessorTests`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the behavior is different for a `ParameterResolver` applied to the constructor of an enclosing class for the currently executing `@Nested` test class.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Determine which lifecycle callback methods are affected by this.\r\n  - [ ] Ensure appropriate tests are in place for `@BeforeAll`\r\n  - [ ] Ensure appropriate tests are in place for `@AfterAll`\r\n  - [ ] Ensure appropriate

Quo\r\n\r\nSpring's support for JUnit Jupiter already supports detection of test configuration (e.g., (`@ContextConfiguration`) on `@Nested` classes.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a `@Nested` class does not declare its own test configuration, Spring will not find the configuration from the enclosing class.\r\n\r\nSee also [this discussion on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44203244/transaction-roll-back-is-not-working-in-test-case-in-nested-class-of-junit5/44227179) regarding nested test classes and `@Transactional`.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nInspired by [issue 8](https://github.com/sbrannen/spring-test-junit5/issues/8) from the `spring-test-junit5` project, it would perhaps be desirable if the _Spring TestContext Framework_ would discover test configuration on an enclosing class for a `@Nested` test class.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables \r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce `@NestedTestConfiguration` with `EnclosingConfiguration` enum supporting `INHERITED` and `OVERRIDE` modes.\r\n- [x] Make the default `EnclosingConfiguration` mode globally configurable via `SpringProperties`\r\n- [x] Switch the default `EnclosingConfiguration` mode to `INHERITED`\r\n- [x] `@ContextConfiguration` / `@ContextHierarchy`\r\n- [x] `@ActiveProfiles`\r\n- [x] `@TestPropertySource` / `@TestPropertySources` \r\n- [x] `@WebAppConfiguration`\r\n- [x] `@TestConstructor`\r\n- [x] `@BootstrapWith`\r\n- [x] `@TestExecutionListeners`\r\n- [x] `@DirtiesContext`\r\n- [x] `@Transactional`\r\n- [x] `@Rollback` / `@Commit`\r\n- ❌  `@Sql` / `@SqlConfig` / `@SqlGroup`\r\n  - see #25913\r\n- ❌  Document `@NestedTestConfiguration` support in the reference manual\r\n  - see #25912\r\n- ❌  Document `@NestedTestConfiguration` support and the switching of the default mode to `INHERITED` in the upgrade notes in the wiki\r\n  - see #25912\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Affects:** 5.0\r\n\r\n**Issue Links:**\r\n- #18722 Support nested test classes with SpringClassRule & SpringMethodRule\r\n- #21136 JUnit Jupiter `@Nested` class cannot share enclosing class's ApplicationContext if nested class is deemed to be a configuration candidate\r\n\r\n6 votes, 10

Testing Problem\r\n\r\nWe are currently looking to upgrade our application from Java 17 to Java 21.\r\nWhile our application starts up without issues on Java 21, our unit tests do not complete successfully.\r\nMore specifically, most (not all) of our _jqwik_ unit tests fail.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction\r\nI could, however, reproduce the issue with a simple test case:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass JqwikJdk21Test {\r\n    @Group\r\n    class InGroup {\r\n\r\n        @Property\r\n        void runsWithAnnotations(@ForAll @NumericChars @StringLength(9) String input) {\r\n            assertThat(input).hasSize(9).containsOnlyDigits();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        @Property\r\n        void runsWithProvideFromOuterClass(@ForAll(\"numericStrings\") String input) {\r\n            assertThat(input).hasSize(9).containsOnlyDigits();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Property\r\n    void runsWithProvideFromSameClass(@ForAll(\"numericStrings\") String input) {\r\n        assertThat(input).hasSize(9).containsOnlyDigits();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Provide\r\n    static Arbitrary<String> numericStrings() {\r\n        return Arbitraries.strings().numeric().ofLength(9);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am using following versions:\r\n- openjdk 21.0.1 2023-10-17 LTS\r\n- org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.10.0\r\n- org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.10.0\r\n- net.jqwik:jqwik:1.8.1\r\n- net.jqwik:jqwik-engine:1.8.1\r\n- org.assertj:assertj-core:3.24.2\r\n\r\nWhen running this test, `runsWithProvideFromOuterClass` fails. However, the same test `runsWithProvideFromSameClass` succeeds.\r\nAdditionally, **when reverting to Java 17, all tests succeed.**\r\n\r\nFollowing stacktrace is printed for `runsWithProvideFromOuterClass` ran with Java 21.\r\n```java\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Method [static net.jqwik.api.Arbitrary org.jqwik.jdk21.JqwikJdk21Test.numericStrings()] cannot be

`JqwikReflectionSupport#getOuterInstance` is called. This method calls the deprecated private method `makeAccessible`, but swallows any exceptions, returning an empty `Optional` instead. \r\nProbably the stacktrace of the swallowed exception will give a clue to fix this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jqwik-team/jqwik/issues/528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jqwik-team/jqwik/issues/528/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
