Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `JUnitPlatformPlugin` has logic to be applied `afterEvaluate` which makes it so users must also do some lazy evaluation logic to be able to also configure it.\r\n\r\nFor example, is a user wants to apply configuraiton to the `'junitPlatformTest'` task, they might try this by:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ntasks.getByName('junitPlatformTest').dependsOn(myTask)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will fail at configuration time with an NPE.\r\n\r\nA user will have to work around this by making the configuration more lazy. One workaround for a user would be something like:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ntasks.whenTaskAdded {\r\n  if (it.name == \"junitPlatformTest\") {\r\n    it.dependsOn(myTask)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Make the `JUnitPlatformPlugin` applied at configuration time rather than `afterEvaluate`\r\n- [x] Change is documented in the User Guide and Release Notes","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/708/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
