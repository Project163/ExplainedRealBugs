cases where `assertThrows` cannot be used as the test setup is more intricate than a single operation there is still the need to assert that expected exceptions are of a certain `instanceof` type. \r\n\r\nThe naive way to test this would be for example:\r\n```java\r\nassertTrue(e instanceof IllegalStateException);\r\n```\r\nas I had used it here\r\nhttps://github.com/jbee/purejin/pull/137/files#diff-567a735adbd51f614bf6f2beb67d86ff5ec9d3c7933d59cd0a49b89a6742e39eR68-R71\r\n\r\nThe downside of this is clearly that the message of this assertion isn't useful.\r\nA custom message could be assembled to improve that but I basically would want to rebuild what `assertThrows` already does https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/7f5e22536b26a99b310f565de7df9d8a0518b079/junit-jupiter-api/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/AssertThrows.java#L63-L65\r\n\r\nSo I think this could be extracted to a method in the API either especially for exceptions or more generally to assert that a value is an instance of some specific type.\r\n\r\nFor completeness the API I imagine would be:\r\n```java\r\nvoid assertInstanceOf(Class<?> expected, Object actual);\r\n// and/or\r\nvoid assertExceptionOfType(Class<? extends Throwable> expected, Throwable actual);\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
