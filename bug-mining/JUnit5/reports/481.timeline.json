Marc Philipp implemented the `@TempDir` extension in Pioneer, it was later also added to Jupiter. It didn't (and as of September 2020 doesn't) support custom file systems, but other than that is more feature-rich than Pioneer's variant. This creates an unpleasant situation where there are two extensions that solve the same problem with the same approach, but slightly different feature sets (and an identical name to boot).\r\n\r\nThat said, there are a lot of feature requests for Jupiter's variant (⚠️ _some of these are already implemented!_ ⚠️):\r\n\r\n* [Multiple declarations of `@TempDir` in same parameter list or class declaration should fail](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2219)\r\n* [Support @TempDir on constructor parameters](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1754)\r\n* [Introduce cleanup mode in @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1814)\r\n* [Multiple @TempDirs should result in multiple directories](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1967)\r\n* [Provide support for setting a custom parent directory for @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2088)\r\n* [Support disabling cleanup for @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2159)\r\n* [Support custom file system for `@TempDir`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2400)\r\n* [Make `@TempDir` restore mint permissions before closing context to avoid `AccessDeniedException`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2609)\r\n\r\nAfter evaluating the situation in #277, we decided to remove the extension before the 1.0 release with the goal to look for a better solution to the problem in the future (i.e. this issue). So the task is to come up with a temporary directory (or, more generally temporary resource) extension that covers _more_ than what Jupiter does, possibly with an approach that makes different trade-offs (so users of Jupiter and Pioneer have more choices to solve their specific problem).\r\n\r\nOne interesting proof of concept to look at is @sormuras': [1](https://github.com/sormuras/brahms#temporary-directory-as-resource), [2](https://github.com/sormuras/brahms/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/resource/ChickenAndEggTests.java)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/348/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/850836034","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2159#issuecomment-850836034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2159","id":850836034,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MDgzNjAzNA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-29T13:44:43Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T13:44:43Z","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Overview\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/862, the `TempDirectory` may fail to clean up the temporary directory due to various reasons, but sometimes the user would prefer that the extension not cause the test to fail if certain files or folders within the temporary directory cannot be deleted.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a configurable clean up mode would help to support such use cases.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nProposal by @marcphilipp:\r\n\r\n> I think it should be strict by default in order to catch subtle bugs in the code under test, e.g. an unclosed stream. But changing to a lenient mode via the annotation (sth. like `@TempDir(cleanupMode = LENIENT)`) or a configuration parameter is certainly sth. we can consider for 5.4.1.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Introduce a means to opt out of test failure when the temporary directory cannot be cleaned up automatically.\r\n- [ ] Document in Javadoc.\r\n- [ ] Document in User Guide.\r\n- [ ] Document in Release

The annotation has a single CleanupMode enum field that can have a value of ALWAYS or NEVER. If the field is NEVER, then a test class's TempDirs are not cleaned up after the test completes. The annotation also works on nested classes, and a config parameter for the default cleanup mode has been added.
