But I find myself regularly having to test suspending functions, so I have to wrap my function with a `runBlocking()`. This is a lot of repeating code if your entire codebase is heavily based on coroutines. \r\n\r\n### Proposed fix\r\n\r\nI couldn't possibly have made this issue without also thinking about a solution.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this is what I came up with:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nprivate inline fun <reified T : Throwable> assertThrows(\r\n        noinline executable: suspend () -> Unit\r\n    ) = assertThrows(T::class.java) {\r\n        runBlocking {\r\n            executable()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way you can pass suspending functions as parameter `executable`, which will be invoked in a `runBlocking()` to make sure the suspending function joins before continuing.\r\n\r\n### tl;dr\r\n\r\nI think it would be a good addition to JUnit Jupiter to have functions that allow easy testing of suspending functions.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
