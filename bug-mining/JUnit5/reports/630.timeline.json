Feature Request\r\n\r\nWhen using the available extension contexts in test runs with extensions like `BeforeAllCallback` and `BeforeTestExecutionCallback`, it only seems possible to use these contexts during one test and lose all context information in following test runs.\r\n\r\nTrying to use the parent context of an instance of `ContainerExtensionContext` in a `beforeAllCallback` leads to an empty `Optional` object, thus no information can be used or set.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.BeforeAllCallback;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.BeforeTestExecutionCallback;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ContainerExtensionContext;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.TestExtensionContext;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @author Simon Ebner\r\n */\r\npublic class ParentAwareExtension implements BeforeAllCallback, BeforeTestExecutionCallback {\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void beforeAll(ContainerExtensionContext context) throws Exception {\r\n\t\t/**\r\n\t\t * Issue - no parent context during test execution available to act on\r\n\t\t * or use any global context information\r\n\t\t */\r\n\t\tcontext.getParent().ifPresent(parent -> {\r\n\t\t\tLogger.getLogger(\"JUnit5-Issue\").info(\"'before all' has parent context \" + parent.getDisplayName());\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void beforeTestExecution(TestExtensionContext context) throws Exception {\r\n\t\tcontext.getParent().ifPresent(parent -> {\r\n\t\t\tLogger.getLogger(\"JUnit5-Issue\").info(\"'before test' has parent context \" + parent.getDisplayName());\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great to be able to set and use context information for an entire test run, especially when needing to execute time and resource expensive operations, that could be reduced to one call per entire test run.\r\n\r\n## Suite Considerations\r\n\r\nI am not sure as to how it would be necessary to look also at `@SelectClasses` and `@SelectPackages` in this case, because they also may create a distinct series of tests and thus a logical unit, that might need its own context to be able to separate tests that run in a suite and others. I would like to know your opinion in this respect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"smoyer64","id":328333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64","html_url":"https://github.com/smoyer64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-22T21:43:34Z","updated_at":"2017-03-22T21:43:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/744","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/744/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/744/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/744/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/744","id":216217535,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTYyMTc1MzU=","number":744,"title":"Introduce

Overview\r\n\r\nAs requested in issue #681 (```Introduce junit-platform-suite-api module```), the annotations used for test discovery and selection in the ```JUnitPlatform``` runner have been refactored into the ```junit-platform-suite-api```.  This allows a purely JUnit 5 test suite to be defined declaratively, though it currently requires an alternate engine (as opposed to an extension).\r\n\r\nThis issue describes a generalized JUnit platform suite that's suitable for the Jupiter test engine as well as any others that might be chosen.  It's my opinion that unit tests rarely require test suites, but it becomes far more common when integration, system and acceptance tests are being executed due to the very common integration with external systems that should only be initialized before the entire test run.  Examples of resources that can be safely shared among tests are database connection pools (or really any connection pool), test frameworks that require significant set-up time (e.g. GWT test suites eliminate 20s of HtmlUnit set-up time for each test - it's only incurred once at the beginning of each suite).\r\n\r\nThe examples shown below indicate how the ```@Suite``` annotation can be used in conjunction with those already in the ```junit-platform-suite-api``` module.  Originally I'd also defined the ```@BeforeSuite``` and ```@AfterSuite``` annotations but after further consideration decided that since suites are really just an arbitrary collection of indeterminately nested test containers, it would be better if the ```@BeforeAll``` and ```@AfterAll``` annotations were contextual (nested in the same way the hierarchy would be presented in the test tree).  I've also assumed that these annotations no longer require the static modifier as discussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nImagine if you will a set of acceptance tests that have a custom reporting mechanism that should be configured for the entire test run.  Included within this outer suite is a set of tests that require a database connection pool and a different set of tests that require an LDAP connection pool.  The top-level suite definition for the acceptance tests might look something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Suite\r\n@IncludeEngines(\"jupiter-engine\") // not required if there's only one engine on the classpath\r\n@IncludeClassNamePatterns(\".*AcceptanceTestSuite$\")\r\npublic class AcceptanceTestSuite {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeAll\r\n    void setUp() {\r\n        ... // code to set-up custom test reporting\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterAll() {\r\n    void tearDown() {\r\n        ... // code to tear-down custom test reporting\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two notable characteristics of this test suite:\r\n\r\n1. It specifies which engine will be used for the entire container/test hierarchy (assuming there is more than one).\r\n2. It includes potentially numerous other test suites as sub-containers which can each have their own contextual set-up and tear-down.\r\n\r\nA child suite for tests that require a database connection pool might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Suite\r\n@IncludeTags({\"integration\", \"database\"})\r\n@IncludeClassNamePatterns(\".*IT$\")\r\npublic class DatabaseAcceptanceTestSuite {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeAll\r\n    void setUp() {\r\n        ... // code to set-up the database connection pool\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterAll() {\r\n    void tearDown() {\r\n        ... // code to tear-down the database connection pool\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf run under Maven, test classes that end in \"IT\" would be run using the ```maven-failsafe-plugin```.  If there are other classes of integration tests not run during acceptance testing it would also be necessary to make sure the acceptance test classes were not run (as they'd fail without the suite's set-up methods).\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\nProvide the means for arbitrarily nested, declarative tests suites in JUnit 5 including the execution of set-up and tear-down methods\r\n\r\n##

currently migrating a project from JUnit4 to JUnit5 (Branch: https://github.com/casid/mazebert-ladder/tree/junit5). \r\n\r\nA feature of the JUnit4 tests is that I can run all unit tests in parallel. This is an essential feature since it a) chops down the test execution time significantly and b) prevents developers from adding shared state to unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn JUnit4 with the help of junit-toolbox:\r\n```java\r\n@RunWith(ParallelSuite.class)\r\n@SuiteClasses(\"**/*Test.class\")\r\npublic class UnitTestSuite {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wished JUnit5 to support something like this:\r\n```java\r\n@Suite(parallel = true)\r\n@SuiteClasses(\"**/*Test\")\r\npublic class UnitTestSuite {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't find anything that looked even slightly like it.\r\n\r\nI think suites could greatly improve configuration options for test executions. In fact, it would remove the need for external tools to implement the same features (e.g. parallel execution / test discovery). You could simply point maven-surefire, gradle or IntelliJ to the TestSuite(s) you want to execute.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests could benefit from this too:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Suite(parallel = true)\r\n@SuiteClasses(\"**/*IT\")\r\n@IncludeTags(\"parallel\")\r\npublic class ParallelIntegrationTestSuite {\r\n    @BeforeClass\r\n    public static void setUp() throws Exception {\r\n        TestDataSourceProvider.instance.prepare();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterClass\r\n    public static void tearDown() throws Exception {\r\n        TestDataSourceProvider.instance.dispose();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would love to have something like this in JUnit5!
