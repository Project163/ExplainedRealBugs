have one test that changes the global state, for example\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\nvoid localeTest() {\r\n  Locale.setDefault(Locale.FRENCH);\r\n  assertEquals(\"Bunjour\", getMessage());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand hundreds of tests that reads the state:\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\nvoid someTest() {\r\n  assertEquals(\"Hello\", getMessage());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter enabling parallel test execution our tests start to fail at random locations with messages like that:\r\n`[ERROR]   message 0 expected:<...Annotation.java:17: [Annotation 'AnnotationAnnotation' have incorrect indentation level 2, expected level should be 0].> but was:<...Annotation.java:17: [Die Annotation 'AnnotationAnnotation' hat eine unerwartete Einrückungstiefe von 2 (erwartet: 0)].>`\r\n\r\n`@Execution(ExecutionMode.SAME_THREAD)` for the test `localeTest` won't help us, since the all other tests are able to run concurrent with every other test and with `localeTest` too.\r\n\r\nThis can be solved with `@ResourceLock`:\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\n@Execution(ExecutionMode.SAME_THREAD)\r\n@ResourceLock(value=\"global\", mode=READ_WRITE)\r\nvoid localeTest() {\r\n  Locale.setDefault(Locale.FRENCH);\r\n  assertEquals(\"Bunjour\", getMessage());\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\n@Execution(ExecutionMode.CONCURRENT)\r\n@ResourceLock(value=\"global\", mode=READ)\r\nvoid test1() {\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n@Test\r\n@Execution(ExecutionMode.CONCURRENT)\r\n@ResourceLock(value=\"global\", mode=READ)\r\nvoid test100500() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this is error prone, since adding a new Test without this annotation will produce a flaky tests which may fail.\r\n\r\nIt will be much better to mark some tests as \"incompatible with parallel execution at all\":\r\n ```java\r\n@Test\r\n@Execution(ExecutionMode.ALONE) // no other this will be executed in parallel \r\nvoid localeTest() {\r\n  Locale.setDefault(Locale.FRENCH);\r\n  assertEquals(\"Bunjour\", getMessage());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, it is possible to turn such a test into Junit 4 test, which will be executed in other universe, isolated from all other.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
