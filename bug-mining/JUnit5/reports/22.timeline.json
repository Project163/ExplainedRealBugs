In my opinion, it's significantly more tedious to write `Optional.ofNullable(target)` than just `target` or `null` as a user of such an API.\n\nIf a `ParameterResolver` impl were to use `Optional` internally, I'd expect it to be an implementation detail only, and for the `ParameterResolver` impl to have in its constructor a line like `this.target = Optional.ofNullable(target)`, so that it deals
