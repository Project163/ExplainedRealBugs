initially developing tests against legacy code that utilizes the filesystem extensively, I often find myself creating using `@TempDir`, which is fantastic. But oftentimes when debugging and/or initially writing the test I need to capture the outputs to get a \"golden file\" that I can regression test against on future runs. As such, currently I just use a non-TempDir folder to capture them, then need to update my test using TempDir later.\r\n\r\nIt would be super helpful if instead the TempDir annotation provided an option so that I could disable cleanup for a couple of runs then re-enable cleanup later in the development lifecycle. I'm envisioning something like the following\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@TempDir(cleanup=false)\r\nprivate Path outputFolder;\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2159/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
