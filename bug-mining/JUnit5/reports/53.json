This problem is also seen when ```assertAll()``` throws a ```MultipleFailuresError```.  The example below demonstrates both these failure conditions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertAllExample() {\r\n\tassertAll(\r\n\t\t() -> { throw new AssertionError(new Throwable(\"first thing went wrong\")); },\r\n\t\t() -> { throw new AssertionError(new Throwable(\"second thing went wrong\")); },\r\n\t\t() -> assertThat(\"ERROR! - something is broke\", not(containsString(\"ERROR!\")))\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertOneExample() {\r\n\tassertTrue(false, \"Wasn't expecting that!\\n\\nNow I've broken the tree\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output from when these tests are run via Gradle is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n│  ├─ example.testrule.ErrorCollectorJupiterDemo\r\n│  │  ├─ assertAllExample ✘ Multiple Failures (3 failures)\r\n        java.lang.Throwable: first thing went wrong\r\n        java.lang.Throwable: second thing went wrong\r\n        \r\nExpected: not a string containing \"ERROR!\"\r\n     but: was \"ERROR! - something is broke\"\r\n│  │  ├─ assertOneExample ✘ Wasn't expecting that!\r\n\r\nNow I've broken the tree\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Continue the tree structure across line breaks similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n│  ├─ example.testrule.ErrorCollectorJupiterDemo\r\n│  │  ├─ assertAllExample ✘ Multiple Failures (3 failures)\r\n│  │  │    java.lang.Throwable: first thing went wrong\r\n│  │  │    java.lang.Throwable: second thing went wrong\r\n│  │  │    \r\n│  │  │    Expected: not a string containing \"ERROR!\"\r\n│  │  │    but: was \"ERROR! - something is broke\"\r\n│  │  ├─ assertOneExample ✘ Wasn't expecting that!\r\n│  │  │    \r\n│  │  │    Now I've broken the tree\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
