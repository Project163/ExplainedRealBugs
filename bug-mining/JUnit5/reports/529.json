an arguments provider needs to be initialised with an annotation externally before you can call `provideArguments`. It has to implement something like `Consumer<A>` or [`AnnotationConsumer<A>`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.params/org/junit/jupiter/params/support/AnnotationConsumer.html). It'd be nice to have an extension point that merged `ArgumentsProvider` with `AnnotationConsumer<A>` (something like `AnnotationBasedArgumentsProvider<A>` so I could call `provideArguments(ExtensionContext extensionContext, A annotation)` instead of `accept(A annotation)` and then `provideArguments(ExtensionContext extensionContext)`.\r\n\r\nAn example extension that consumes an annotation is [CsvArgumentsProvider](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/main/junit-jupiter-params/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/CsvArgumentsProvider.java). It seems `AnnotationConsumer<A>` is only used by `ArgumentsProvider` implementations (?).\r\n\r\nMaybe this is too simple and doesn't add much value, other than a bit of convenience.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Another option is to not constrict the `ArgumentsProvider` in such a way (i.e.: `AnnotationConsumer` can only consume annotations) and have a more generic type parameter. This way the `ArgumentsProvider` can be initialised with anything - I recently used this approach with `Parameter`.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] A new (very simple) extension point merging `AnnotationConsumer<A>` and `ArgumentsProvider`\r\n- [ ] Alternatively: A new extension point merging `Consumer<T>` and `ArgumentsProvider`.","closed_by":{"login":"juliette-derancourt","id":28359762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzU5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28359762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt","html_url":"https://github.com/juliette-derancourt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
