Overview\r\n\r\n`ReflectionUtils.getOutermostInstance()` has been deprecated since JUnit 5.4 due to changes made in conjunction with #1650.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, since Java 18 one can no longer rely on the presence of a `this$0` field that holds a reference to the enclosing instance.\r\n\r\nIn light of that, the team has decided to remove this deprecated, internal method.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #1650\r\n- JDK issue: [Omit enclosing instance fields from inner classes that don't use it](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8271623)\r\n-
