can return a stream of `DynamicContainers` and `DynamicTest`.  It would be awesome if we could run containers in parallel, but the tests within containers on the same thread.\r\n\r\nThe `@Execution` seems to only allow you to switch from everything parallel/concurrent or everything on the same thread.\r\n\r\nThe configuration parameters `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default` and  `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default` also don't seem to allow such a configuration, probably because all test suites and test are coming from the same `class`.\r\n\r\nFor example: the following should allow tests `test1` and `test2` that are in `suite1` to be run on the same thread, and the tests in `suite2` to be run on a different, but consistent thread:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nstatic class Runner {\r\n\r\n    @TestFactory\r\n    Stream<DynamicNode> systemTest() {\r\n        final Stream<DynamicNode> tests1 = Stream.of(\r\n                        DynamicTest.dynamicTest(\"test1\", () -> {System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + \" -test1\");}),\r\n                        DynamicTest.dynamicTest(\"test2\", () -> {System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + \" - test2\");}));\r\n\r\n        final Stream<DynamicNode> tests2 = Stream.of(\r\n                        DynamicTest.dynamicTest(\"test3\", () -> {System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + \" -test3\");}),\r\n                        DynamicTest.dynamicTest(\"test4\", () -> {System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + \" - test4\");}));\r\n\r\n        return Stream.of(\r\n                DynamicContainer.dynamicContainer(\"suite1\", tests1),\r\n                DynamicContainer.dynamicContainer(\"suite2\", tests2));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be achieved via one or more of:\r\n  * a new `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.container.default` property\r\n  * a field on `@TestFactory` to control execution\r\n  * an enhancement to `@Execution`\r\n  * a parameter to `DynamicContainer`\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n  \r\n  ","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2497/reactions","total_count":21,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2497/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
