developing a test library I am torn on the composition of extension. Users of the library should only need to list one extension but often that extension has multiple responsibilities that would otherwise be broken down into multiple classes.\r\n\r\nFor example, a library might perform different tasks as different stages in the life cycle as well support parameter injection for different types. It would be helpful if the library developer could implement multiple extensions, one per task/responsibility, and use a Junit natively supported way of combining those into a single extension for the user. This makes the extensions less complex, more testable, and eases maintenance because of the separation of responsibilities.\r\n\r\nOne solution could be to add a CompositeExtension class to Junit that handles multiple extensions in the same way that Junit would when multiple extensions are listed using `@ExtendWith`. Developers could extend CompositeExtension and implement some method `protected List<Object> getExtensions()` with all extensions that should be included. This gives test library developers the flexibility of small single purpose extension without expecting users to explicitly list them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n``` java\r\npublic abstract class CompositeExtension implements <all-junit-extension-interfaces> {\r\n  \r\n  protected abstract List<Object> getExtensions();\r\n  \r\n  @Override\r\n  public void afterEach(ExtensionContext context) throws Exception {\r\n    getExtensions().forEach(e -> e.afterEach(context));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ... implement remaining methods in similar fashion\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2372/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2372/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
