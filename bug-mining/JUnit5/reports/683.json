it is not possible to order children without first removing all children and then adding them back in order. E.g:\n\n```java\nvar children = new ArrayList<>(testDescriptor.getChildren());\nCollections.shuffle(children);\nchildren.forEach(testDescriptor::removeChild);\nchildren.forEach(testDescriptor::addChild);\n```\n\nBy adding `orderChildren(UnaryOperator<List<TestDescriptor>> orderer)` would become possible to write:\n\n```java\ntestDescriptor.orderChildren(children -> {\n\tCollections.shuffle(children);\n\treturn children;\n});\n```\n\nI've made https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/4289 to explore this solution.\n\nAnd I found two items worth discussing:\n\n* `TestDescriptor` is an interface, adding a method requires a sensible default. What should that default be?\n* Should that default implementation be functional, because `TestDescriptor` is an interface a default implementation must still use `removeChild` and `addChild`. Is it necessary to add a more optimized implementation in `AbstractTestDescriptor`?\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
