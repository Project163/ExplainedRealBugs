#2217, configuration has been done to ensure Reproducible Build by building 2-times on the same machine and comparing results, as checked with https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/main/gradle/scripts/checkBuildReproducibility.sh\r\n\r\nIt works fine, great\r\n\r\nThere is a second level of expectation from https://reproducible-builds.org/ : **a third party** should be able to rebuild and get the same output\r\n\r\nFor this, we have 2 issues with the current setup:\r\n1. `Created-By:` the detailed JVM info is stored in `META-INF/MANIFEST` for example `Created-By: 17.0.8 (Azul Systems, Inc. 17.0.8+7-LTS)`, which forces the rebuilder to install the exact same JVM distribution (if feasible)\r\n2. `Build-Time` and `Build-Date` are stored in `META-INF/MANIFEST`: perhaps we can extract the value from `META-INF/MANIFEST` and inject as `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` env variable, but it is really cumbersome\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n- In theory: \r\nthe binaries published to Maven Central are reproducible, because when rebuilding in Reproducible Central https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/blob/master/content/org/junit/junit5/README.md , these 2 differences are the only differences found: then in theory, the build environment can be worked out to match expectations to get the same output\r\n\r\n- In practice:\r\nthis is really hard to rebuild to get the same output: it would be nice to drop these 2 aspects, or give an easy way to override detected values when
