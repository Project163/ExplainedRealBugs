5.10.0.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a custom extension that implements `BeforeEachCallback`.\r\n- In its `beforeEach()` method make the extension put a `CloseableResource` into context's store.\r\n- Make this `CloseableResource` throw a (runtime) exception on closing.\r\n\r\nResult: JUnit logs the exception _and_ fails the current test.\r\n\r\nExpected: the test fails, but exception is not logged.\r\n\r\nRationale: (apparently) all other exceptions simply make the test fail, but are not logged additionally. We use logging configuration that normally writes to a file (for later investigation), but _additionally_ writes all messages with WARN and ERROR levels to console, for maximum visibility. This is very helpful in most cases, but here it makes the output contain duplicated stacktraces: once from the log (as said, ERRORs are duplicated to stderr by our configuration) and once from normal JUnit output, once the test fails.\r\n\r\nAlso, logging exceptions is practically a must when you \"eat\" them (i.e. don't rethrow, but also don't really handle), so they don't just get lost; and a possibility when said exception might get clobbered by something. But here it's not the case, because exception will make the current test fail and its stacktrace will be properly preserved.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): JUnit 5.10.0\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Gradle (irrelevant)\r\n\r\nIf really needed I could create a reproducer, but would prefer to avoid this. I cannot use our codebase for this, as it is very complex and contains a lot of completely irrelevant stuff.\r\n\r\nIn JUnit's code the problem is here:\r\n\r\n\t\tExtensionContext extensionContext = getExtensionContext();\r\n\t\tif (extensionContext instanceof AutoCloseable) {\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\t((AutoCloseable) extensionContext).close();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tcatch (Exception e) {\r\n\t\t\t\tlogger.error(e, () -> \"Caught exception while closing extension context: \" + extensionContext);\r\n\t\t\t\tthrow e;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nAs far as I see, you could just drop exception catching+logging+rethrowing and that would be it.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
