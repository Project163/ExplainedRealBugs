templates are a great way to create extensions that generate test cases per method. If an extension wants to generate suites of tests per class, though, this is not easily possible. I propose to implement a container template extension point that functions similarly to test template:\r\n\r\n* it defines the number of executions `n` - but in this case per container, which makes Jupiter work all its \"execute tests in this class\" magic not once but `n` times\r\n* each invocation is called with a context, which most importantly contains the index of the current iteration\r\n* additional extensions can be registered\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to consider whether other extensions should be allowed to easily access the container invocation context, maybe from the `ExtensionContext` they already receive. (Thinking about that, wouldn't it make sense to do the same for test templates, i.e. give `ExtensionContext` a method that returns the invocation context?)\r\n\r\nWhere parameterized test methods were the canonical example of how to use test templates, theories would be the canonical example for container templates. With this extension point the theories extension would use reflection to find out how many parameters were defined and then have the class be executed so many times, each time dropping a different set of parameters into all test methods:\r\n\r\n* `a = 0; b = 0`\r\n    * `testAddition(a, b)`\r\n    * `testSubtraction(a, b)`\r\n* `a = 0; b = 1`\r\n    * `testAddition(a, b)`\r\n    * `testSubtraction(a, b)`\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #878 \r\n- #1141 \r\n- #723 \r\n- #1239\r\n- #2092\r\n  ","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/871/reactions","total_count":34,"+1":34,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
