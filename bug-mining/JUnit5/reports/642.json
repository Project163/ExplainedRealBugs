JUnit 5 documentation in the [2.5.

The explanation would be valuable for a better understanding and to know explicitly when use mandatorily an approach over the other. Currently in the complete/full documentation only appears through a sample code the `() -> \"something\"` approach just twice, but not more. Some example(s) is/are appreciate showing the two approaches together and to understand clearly the difference of use of one over the other. Therefore I want to know when would be mandatory use the _lambda_ approach. So far, the current official documentation does not cover this explicitly\r\n\r\nI already wrote a question on SO about this question at:\r\n\r\n* [JUnit 5: What does \"Assertion messages can be lazily evaluated\" mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75348941/junit-5-what-does-assertion-messages-can-be-lazily-evaluated-mean)\r\n\r\nThe answer has sense, but if it can be covered and _expanded_ from the official source documentation would be nice for the community\r\n\r\nThanks for your understanding","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3153/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
