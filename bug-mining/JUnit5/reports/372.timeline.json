default test executer does not enforce an ordering of tests, which makes unit test execution indeterministic. In cases where tests leak their state (which is certainly undesirable, but not a rare occurrence), test ordering would affect the outcome. Reproducing these flakey conditions is extremely hard without the ability to replicate the test execution order.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the test executor should accept an optional seed for randomizing the order of the tests (with the default being, say, lexicographical order), and this seed should be declared as a task input. In the default case, the seed is undefined and tests run in a set order - which would guarantee that users get the same test results locally and in CI. A separate CI job may potentially run tests on random seeds to detect test ordering issues.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus, ordering tests enables the ability to shard test execution. The executor could then take two extra parameters, shard number and shard count, to allow for test execution be split for parallel execution.\r\n\r\nWe've used this configuration internally for several years by overriding the default executor to implement ordering and sharding, and it would be ideal if that was made available by default.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gradle/gradle/issues/8520/reactions","total_count":32,"+1":32,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gradle/gradle/issues/8520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
