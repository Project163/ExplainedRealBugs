The rationale varied from \"the coolness factor\" to \"something to be visibly proud of\" to \"something to impress my current employer and future potential employers\".\r\n\r\n### Benefits Above and Beyond Git History\r\n\r\nThe presence of `@author` tags has benefits above and beyond those provided by tools such as git history and git blame.\r\n\r\n- `@author` tags still tell you something about the history of a file even when tools such as git history and git blame cannot tell the whole story (e.g., because the information has been lost due to refactorings, renaming/moving projects, etc.)\r\n- See the following comments for further benefits of `@author` tags\r\n   - https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/914#issuecomment-312963347\r\n   - https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/914#issuecomment-312965419\r\n\r\n### Potential Legal Ramifications\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are potential legal ramifications associated with *not* including `@author` tags as pointed out [here](https://twitter.com/aalmiray/status/882255680530415618). Also, the Eclipse Public License version 1.0 contains the following requirement.\r\n\r\n> Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAvoid potential legal issues and honor all open source contributors by including `@author` tags in Java source code and including author information as part of the published Javadoc.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/914/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":4,"-1":4,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/914/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
