additional thoughts: \r\nLooking at the code and being used to work with ForkJoinPool, I can guess some benefits of using the ForkJoin framework. It would naturally focus on sub-tasks to complete the execution of a given class or parameterized tests before moving to other classes. \r\nHowever, IMO, the mistake is that a `ForkJoinTask` should only run CPU intensive tasks. JUnit cannot know the content of tests. Some may be real unit tests, only depending on the CPU. Some may be real unit tests but reading the disk. Some may be more integration tests, making network calls using whatever framework. In those cases, for defensive measures, users of the ForkJoin framework have to rely on [ManagedBlock](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/98fa48c330941efe6588a907b383802a11ed0e6b/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.java#L3718-L3726). The drawback of Managed blocker is that they start new threads.\r\n\r\nYet another solution could be to use a ForkJoinPool for scheduling of the tests and a standard executor for the execution of the tests.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1352738554/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OPeyrusse","id":29573092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTczMDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29573092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse","html_url":"https://github.com/OPeyrusse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1352933939","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3108#issuecomment-1352933939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3108","id":1352933939,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH85QpCIz","user":{"login":"OPeyrusse","id":29573092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTczMDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29573092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse","html_url":"https://github.com/OPeyrusse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OPeyrusse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-15T11:36:49Z","updated_at":"2022-12-15T11:36:49Z","body":"There is also a short snippet reproducing this behavior [here](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/3044#issuecomment-1290523279).\r\nHowever, the current choice was to say that the doc will be update to say the configuration limits the number of threads, not the number of tests.

@marcphilipp , nope it will not help. The feature advertised was already one we looked at, when it was at the stage of PR.\r\nIf you look again, you will see that only two threads from the ForkJoinPool are being used.\r\nTough not tested, I would even say that with only one thread, you can reproduce the problem above. As stated in my description, it comes from the FJ framework detecting the use of ForkJoinPool in a ForkJoinThread, leading it to attempt some work instead of waiting.\r\nSo limiting the number of threads in the pool or its saturation will not resolve the issue. Here, the issue is that too many tests are started.\r\n\r\nI can give you an analogy with the following story:\r\nThere is a factory that can manufacture cars. It takes time, more or less depending on the car models. Building a car is the analogy to running a single test. The factory has enough workers to build several cars concurrently.\r\nThere are also clerks coming to the factory with orders to manufacture cars. Those are JUnit ForkJoinTasks, produced after discovering that tests must be run.\r\nWhen a clerk arrives at the factory, it delivers the order to the factory, that immediately starts working on it. \r\nThe factory has chosen, for company reasons, to operate using the FJP methodology (they are smart). The weird thing is that the clerk **sees** that, and because the clerk company is also using the FJP methodology, the clerk decides not to stay idle and do something while waiting for the car to be made. Obviously, the clerk cannot join the factory workers - it is not its job - so to do something, the clerk picks the next task available to him, which is **go back to the office to pick another order**. \r\nBecause clerks make faster trips to the office than the factory can produce cars, the factory becomes overflowed with orders - which, in the computer world, translates to memory starvation, stack overflow, etc\r\n\r\nI hope this helps understand the logic triggering the issue :smiley:
