Overview\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of  [isPotentialJUnit4TestClass](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/junit-vintage-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/vintage/engine/discovery/IsPotentialJUnit4TestClass.java#L30) excludes any member class. This can be seen in #778. To reiterate, a member class is: \r\n\r\n> A member class is a class whose declaration is directly enclosed in the body of\r\nanother class or interface declaration (§8.1.6, §9.1.4).\r\n\r\nfrom the java 8 specification section 8.5 page 256\r\n\r\nThis also includes static inner classes. But JUnit 4 does consider static inner classes as valid. An example for this would be the [enclosed runner](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/'Enclosed'-test-runner-example). \r\n\r\nIf a static member class is indeed the only valid one for JUnit4, we can simply add a check:\r\n```java\r\nReflectionUtils.isStatic(testClass)\r\n```\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] A corrected implementaiton of `isPotentialJUnit4TestClass`\r\n- [x] Unit tests for `isPotentialJUnit4TestClass`\r\n- [x] Bug fix entry in the release notes \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/781/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
