below:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nbuildscript {\r\n    ext {\r\n        kotlinVersion = '1.0.5-2'\r\n        springBootVersion = '1.4.2.RELEASE'\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    repositories {\r\n

testCompile(\"org.jetbrains.spek:spek-junit-platform-engine:1.0.89\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like, even though we specify the version of junit-platform-runner to be `1.0.0-M2`, it uses latest `1.0.0-M3`. And it runs with `ConsoleLauncher` with a `--all` option which is not supported.\r\n\r\nIf we do not apply the junit-platform plugin and add it as a compile time dependency for our tests instead, everything seems to be working fine.\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/578/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/578/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-04T10:41:13Z","updated_at":"2016-12-04T10:41:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/479","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/479/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/479/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/479/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/479","id":173255857,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNzMyNTU4NTc=","number":479,"title":"Exception
