Overview\r\n\r\nSee the discussion in #492 for details.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #367\r\n- #407 \r\n- #492 \r\n- #732 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n- [x] Investigate whether we can get rid of `isTest()` and `isContainer()`.\r\n- [ ]  Introduce support for allowing a `TestDescriptor` to state that it will _eventually_ register dynamic tests, if still desirable.\r\n\r\n## Initial Team Brainstorming\r\n\r\n- For reporting, we somehow need to figure out whether or not a `TestDescriptor` points to a test. Otherwise, we won't be able to tell how many tests have been executed. Therefore, it might not be possible to get rid of `isTest()` or at least the concept of a \"test\".\r\n- Allowing the dynamic registration of `TestDescriptor`s at any time (also within a test itself) makes the concept of a \"container\" superfluous. Every `TestDescriptor` may possibly be a container or at least become one (see also #407). Therefore, removing `isContainer()` seems to be reasonable.\r\n\r\n_Concerning eventually registering dynamic tests:_\r\n\r\n- While we might spawn new tests during runtime, it may be difficult to state whether or not additional tests may be registered. Only after test execution of the current `TestDescriptor` can we give a guaranteed answer that no or all children have been found.\r\n- This is closely related to the extension mechanism and its implementation by a `TestEngine`. One might expect that a `TestDescriptor` `CHILD` below a `TestDescriptor` `PARENT` would inherit the context and state of `PARENT`, i.e. all `BeforeAll/Each` and `AfterAll/Each` statements will get executed. This might be difficult to guarantee (at least for the Jupiter Engine).\r\n  - Having said that, a `hasBeenExecuted()` method might be a good alternative, but it doesn't help us with pruning the `TestPlan` up-front.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
