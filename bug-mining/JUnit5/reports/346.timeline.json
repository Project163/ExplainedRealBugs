I came across this issue looking for `up-for-grabs` on junit5. \r\nI have spent a few days to understand the issue and have been able to reproduce it and perform some tweaks on it. Here is my understanding : \r\n\r\n- The exclusion of tests based on tags is done in discovery phase. Exclusions are removed from ExecutionTree itself.\r\n- Reporting or providing a summary is done via listeners that are invoked on execution events such as test execution start or end etc. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways that I could think of approaching this. \r\n\r\n1. Receive another listener / reporter, for discovery phase events / reports at the start of execution, similar to `TestExecutionListener`. Pass such exclusion information to that during the discovery phase. Engines can then consume that and get a summary of what happened during the discovery phase. This could be along the lines of #242 and can serve general purpose reporting of events (maybe validation errors etc as well) of discovery phase. \r\n2. Do not remove the excluded tests during discovery phase from the execution tree, pass some information indicating that these are excluded methods in the TestDescriptor and consume that during the execution. (Flow similar to skipped tests.) During the execution we can report the events of exclusion to the test execution listener (will need to add some new methods to the listener interface for such events). \r\n3. Extend the TestExecutionListener, add some methods to the interface for discovery phase events. Pass the listener to discoveryRequest and eventually to `Root.java`. The filters can then send events / errors to this listener. \r\n\r\nI along with @logic-1 want to take a shot at this issue and similar issues in junit diagnostics (Mostly the ones summarised in #242 ). Please guide us here, we are new to open source but we would like to give it a try.

sorry for the belated reply. This somehow slipped under the radar.\r\n\r\nI tend to agree with @marcphilipp. At this point in time, we are not aware of considerable interest in having this information reported in builds or IDEs.\r\n\r\nRather, we believe that logging filtered out containers and tests would be sufficient for an initial attempt at providing such diagnostic information to users.\r\n\r\nIf we later determine that there is significant community interest in a formal reporting mechanism for this, we then might consider options # 1 and # 3 that you suggested.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/537105901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2677621471,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY3NzYyMTQ3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2677621471","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-01T16:00:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2677621473,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2Nzc2MjE0NzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2677621473","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-01T16:00:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2677621479,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY3NzYyMTQ3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2677621479","actor":{"login":"antimpatel","id":12744520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzQ0NTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12744520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel","html_url":"https://github.com/antimpatel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antimpatel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-01T16:00:45Z","performed_via_github_app":n
