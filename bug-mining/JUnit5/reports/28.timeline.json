using JDK 8 and `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1`:\r\n`MalformedParametersException` is thrown when calling `java.lang.reflect.Method#getParameters()` on some synthetic bridge methods.\r\n\r\nConcerns version 5.11.0-M1 only: doesn't occur with 5.10.2 and older releases of \"junit-jupiter-engine\".\r\n\r\nAlso it only happens when using JDK-8:\r\n\r\n- Java               : 1.8\r\n- JVM vendor name    : Private Build\r\n- JVM vendor version : 25.402-b06\r\n- JVM name           : OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM\r\n- JVM version        : 1.8.0_402-8u402-ga-2ubuntu1~22.04-b06\r\n- JVM info           : mixed mode\r\n- OS name            : Linux\r\n- OS version         : 6.5.0-28-generic\r\n\r\nThis only concerns JDK 8. Everything seems to work just fine with later JDKs (e.g. 11, 17, 21).\r\n\r\nThere is something about how `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1` was compiled that makes it not fully compatible with JDK 8.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOutput from this program pinpoints the root problem:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException;\r\nimport java.lang.reflect.Method;\r\nimport java.util.*;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.engine.descriptor.*;\r\nimport org.junit.platform.engine.support.hierarchical.EngineExecutionContext;\r\n\r\nclass MalformedParametersException_forJupiterSyntheticNodeMethodImplementations_onlyOnJdk8 {\r\n    public static void main(String[] ___) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on \" + System.getProperty(\"java.version\") + \" ...\");\r\n\r\n        java.util.stream.Stream.of(\r\n                JupiterTestDescriptor.class, ClassBasedTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                ClassTestDescriptor.class, MethodBasedTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                TestMethodTestDescriptor.class, TestTemplateTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                TestTemplateInvocationTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                TestFactoryTestDescriptor.class, NestedClassTestDescriptor.class)\r\n\r\n                .forEach(descriptorClass -> {\r\n\r\n            Set<String> reasonsForMalformedParameters = new HashSet<>();\r\n            StringBuilder methodsWithMalformedParameters = new StringBuilder();\r\n            for (Method m : descriptorClass.getDeclaredMethods()) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    m.getParameters();\r\n\r\n                } catch (MalformedParametersException badParameters) {\r\n                    assert m.isSynthetic();\r\n                    assert m.getParameterTypes()[0] == EngineExecutionContext.class;\r\n                    reasonsForMalformedParameters.add(badParameters.getMessage());\r\n                    methodsWithMalformedParameters.append(\"\\n ->\").append(m\r\n                            .toString().substring(\"public\".length())\r\n                            .replaceAll(\"(?<=[ ,(])[a-zA-Z\\\\.]*\\\\.\", \" \")\r\n                            .replaceFirst(\" throws .++\", \"\"));\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            if (false == reasonsForMalformedParameters.isEmpty()) {\r\n                System.out.println(\"\\n\" + reasonsForMalformedParameters\r\n                        + \" was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on \"\r\n                        + descriptorClass.getSimpleName() + \":\" + methodsWithMalformedParameters);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the above program on my laptop, using JDK 8 and `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1`, results in this output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning on 1.8.0_402 ...\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on JupiterTestDescriptor:\r\n ->  Node$SkipResult  shouldBeSkipped( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n -> void  cleanUp( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on ClassBasedTestDescriptor:\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  before( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n -> void  after( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on MethodBasedTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  nodeSkipped( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, Node$SkipResult)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestMethodTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  cleanUp( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n -> void  nodeFinished( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, TestExecutionResult)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  execute( EngineExecutionContext, Node$DynamicTestExecutor)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestTemplateTestDescriptor:\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  execute( EngineExecutionContext, Node$DynamicTestExecutor)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestTemplateInvocationTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  after( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestFactoryTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  nodeSkipped( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, Node$SkipResult)\r\n -> void  nodeFinished( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, TestExecutionResult)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above pinpoints a root problem that is far away from regular developer concerns, but it causes other indirect problems further down the road. E.g. using Mockito 4.11's `inline-mockmaker` to mock the above classes (on JDK 8) is problematic: \"Mockito cannot mock this class: ...\".\r\n\r\nBut test descriptor classes that don't have these synthetic bridge methods (e.g. `ClassTestDescriptor` and `NestedClassTestDescriptor`) are perfectly mockable.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nAbove program was run with these jars on classpath:\r\n\r\n  - junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1.jar\r\n  - unit-platform-engine-1.11.0-M1.jar\r\n  - junit-platform-commons-1.11.0-M1.jar\r\n  - junit-jupiter-api-5.11.0-M1.jar\r\n\r\nJDK details:\r\n\r\n- Java               : 1.8\r\n- JVM vendor name    : Private Build\r\n- JVM vendor version : 25.402-b06\r\n- JVM name           : OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM\r\n- JVM version        : 1.8.0_402-8u402-ga-2ubuntu1~22.04-b06\r\n- JVM info           : mixed mode\r\n- OS name            : Linux\r\n- OS version         : 6.5.0-28-generic\r\n\r\nThis issue report only concerns classes of `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1.jar`, but there is reason to suspect similar situation with other 5.11.0-M1 artifacts wherever there are synthetic bridge methods.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3797/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
