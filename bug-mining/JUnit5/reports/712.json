Goals\r\n\r\nSupport running suspend test in JUnit Jupiter:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass Kit {\r\n    @Test \r\n    suspend fun foo() {\r\n        delay(1000) // suspend call\r\n        assertEquals(1, 1)\r\n    } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, such test can be written this way:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass Kit {\r\n    @Test \r\n    fun foo() = runBlocking {\r\n        delay(1000) // suspend call\r\n        assertEquals(1, 1)\r\n        assertThrows { /* ... */ } \r\n        Unit // test should return void, but `assertThrows` returns `Throwable`, so `foo` returns `Throwable` too \r\n    } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, will be nice to provide `CoroutineScope` through params, or as receiver in extension:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass Kit {\r\n    suspend fun foo(scope: CoroutinesScope) {  /* ... */  } // (1)\r\n    suspend fun CoroutinesScope.foo() {  /* ... */  } // (2)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1 and 2 actually the same on bytecode level. `suspend` is optional.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, support for `runBlockingTest`:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass Kit {\r\n    suspend fun foo(scope: TestCoroutinesScope) {  /* ... */  }\r\n    suspend fun TestCoroutinesScope.foo() {  /* ... */  } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What can be done currently\r\n\r\n`ParameterResolver` can be used to provide stubs for `Continuation`, `CoroutineScope` and `TestCoroutineScope`. These stub arguments can be replaced with real arguments in invocation.\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\n\r\nCurrent extensions points not enough to implement this feature as extensions, since:\r\n\r\n1. **Discovery**. Jupiter discovers tests that returns `void`, but `suspend fun` returns `Object`;\r\n2. **Invocation**. `InvocationInterceptor` in 5.5-M1(SNAPSHOT) don't providing mechanism to override actual invocation, only to decoration of existing invocation. Conversion of `method` to `kotlinFunction`, and then executing using [`callSuspend`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.reflect.full/call-suspend.html) is necessary to execute `suspend fun`.\r\n\r\nAlso, my [slides](https://ruslan.ibragimov.by/pages/cv/speaker/kotlin-night-kiev-2019-junit.pdf) about this topic.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1914/reactions","total_count":102,"+1":99,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1914/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
