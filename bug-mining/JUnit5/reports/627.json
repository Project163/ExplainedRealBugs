Overview\r\n\r\nBased on discussions in #1184 and https://github.com/weld/weld-junit/issues/3, it is apparent that we need to document _best practices_ for implementing `ParameterResolver`, particularly with regard to \"playing nicely\" with other registered `ParameterResolver` implementations.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Categories\r\n\r\nAfter having put a bit more thought into the subject, I am tossing around the idea of categorizing `ParameterResolver` implementations by behavior as follows.\r\n\r\n- **explicit**: support requires an annotation for disambiguation.\r\n- **implicit**: support is automatic for types _owned_ by the resolver.\r\n- **speculative**: a resolver claims it _can_ support a given parameter even if it potentially _should not_ (a.k.a., _greedy_ or _eager_).\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document best practices for `ParameterResolver` implementations in JavaDoc.\r\n  - more succinct than the documentation in the User Guide\r\n- [ ] Document best practices for `ParameterResolver` implementations in the User Guide.\r\n  - including examples and explanations of how to avoid conflicts\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1190/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
