To perform the validation before the directory is created, we'd have to introduce some new API for `TempDirFactory` (related to https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3910#issuecomment-2260559403). Or do you have something else in mind?\r\n\r\n> Additionally, we need to ensure whenever `TempDirFactory.createTempDirectory` was called, the corresponding `CloseablePath` is closed so the cleanup is executed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, that's already a gap caused by #3901, which I addressed separately in #3911.\r\n\r\n> Therefore, I think we should not throw an exception from the `CloseablePath` constructor but validate in the `getPathOrFile` method.\r\n\r\nIf the `CloseablePath` constructor throws an exception, it would be handled similarly to #3911, i.e., with a try/catch that ensures the underlying factory is also closed in case a `PreconditionViolationException` is thrown by the temp directory validation. This way, no `CloseablePath` instance would be created, and no close handling would need to be in the `getPathOrFile` caller.\r\n\r\nOf course, we can push this logic up to `getPathOrFile` and that will require explicit closure of the `CloseablePath`, as you mentioned.\r\n\r\nI think both directions can work so happy to follow your preference.
