Overview\r\n\r\n**Feature request.** Dynamic containers provide the ability to create entire trees of tests and containers dynamically. However, if an exception is thrown while creating a sub portion of the tree then the entire tree results in an error and no test results are gathered.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass DemoTests {\r\n    @TestFactory\r\n    @DisplayName(\"1\")\r\n    Stream<DynamicNode> demo() {\r\n        return Stream.of(\r\n                dynamicContainer(\"1.1\", Stream.of(\r\n                        dynamicTest(\"1.1.1\", () -> {\r\n                        }),\r\n                        dynamicTest(\"1.1.2\", () -> {\r\n                        })\r\n                )),\r\n                dynamicContainer(\"1.2\", IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10)\r\n                        .mapToObj(number -> {\r\n                            if (number == 9) {\r\n                                throw new RuntimeException();\r\n                            }\r\n                            return dynamicTest(\"1.2.\" + number, () -> {\r\n                            });\r\n                        })\r\n                )\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual test result tree is\r\n* :x: Test Results\r\n  * :x: DemoTests\r\n    * :x: 1\r\n      * :x: Class Configuration\r\n\r\nThe desired test result tree is\r\n* :x: Test Results\r\n  * :x: DemoTests\r\n    * :x: 1\r\n      * ✔️ 1\r\n        * ✔️ 1\r\n        * ✔️ 2\r\n      * :x: 2\r\n        * :x: Class Configuration\r\n\r\nWhere part of the tree is executed.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Some way to provide a supplier of dynamic nodes instead of a list/stream of nodes directly.\r\n- [ ] Support for executing available tests in dynamic trees of tests even when branches of the tree are not executable due to throwing an exception.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
