Overview\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3532#issuecomment-1799138369, the search algorithms in JUnit 5 that are used to locate methods and fields have historically had the following undesirable characteristic.\r\n\r\nA field _supersedes_ (shadows, hides, overrides) a field with the same name in a superclass unless a filter (`Predicate`) is applied that ignores one of the fields (such as a `static` check or a check for the presence of a specific annotation).\r\n\r\nThis also applies to any methods looked up via JUnit 5's reflection support -- for example, lifecycle methods and test methods in JUnit Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe JUnit 5 team discussed this topic today and decided to revise our search algorithms to align with Java semantics regarding visibility and overriding. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we want to ensure that our search algorithms do not treat something as _overridden_ when it is not overridden according to the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS).\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, several currently unsupported use cases would become supported -- for example:\r\n\r\n- Two `@TempDir` fields with the same name in a superclass and subclass would both be injected.\r\n- Two `@BeforeEach` methods with the same name/signature in a superclass and subclass would both be invoked, if the `@BeforeEach` method in the superclass is package-private and the subclass resides in a different package (i.e., the `@BeforeEach` method in the subclass does not `@Override` the `@BeforeEach` method in the superclass according to the JVMS).\r\n\r\n## External Resources\r\n\r\n- [Java Virtual Machine Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.5): § 5.4.5, Overriding \r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #960\r\n- #2390\r\n- #2626\r\n- #3242\r\n- #3498\r\n- #3532 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Align method and field search algorithms with Java semantics regarding visibility/overridability.\r\n- [x] Introduce tests for overridden method support. See [comment](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3553#issuecomment-1892570732) below.\r\n- [x] Introduce a configuration parameter / system property -- for example, `junit.platform.reflection.search.useLegacySemantics = true` -- that allows a project to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n- [x] Document in User Guide.\r\n- [x] Document in Release Notes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11616863514,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAbwRH852eyDxzwAAAAK0a0Ua","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/11616863514","actor":{"login":"tturturiello","id":91257004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjU3MDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91257004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello","html_url":"https://github.com/tturturiello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tturturiello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fe303b49cd7b3c2b602d4998f90d88ede2d65aa4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tturturiello/junit5/commits/fe303b49cd7b3c2b602d4998f90d88ede2d65aa4","created_at":"2024-01-27T16:24:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-12T10:15:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T10:15:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32417","id":2179462432,"node_id":"I_kwDOABGHUc6B5_Ug","number":32417,"title":"`ClassCastException`

For Security Vulnerabilities, please go to https://spring.io/security-policy !!!\r\n-->\r\n**Affects:** `6.2.0-SNAPSHOT`\r\n\r\nConsider the following code (enhanced with Lombok for conciseness):\r\n```java\r\npublic abstract class Parent<T> {\r\n    @RequiredArgsConstructor\r\n    @Getter\r\n    public final class Child {\r\n        private final T value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\npublic class ParentInt extends Parent<Integer> {\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public Child childInt() {\r\n        return new Child(123);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\npublic class ParentString extends Parent<String> {\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public Child childString() {\r\n        return new Child(\"abc\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\n@RequiredArgsConstructor\r\npublic class Tester {\r\n    private final ParentString.Child childInt; // <- pay attention to the name\r\n\r\n    @PostConstruct\r\n    public void test() {\r\n        childInt.getValue().startsWith(\"\");\r\n        // java.lang.ClassCastException: class java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to class java.lang.String\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning it will cause a `java.lang.ClassCastException`.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the types `ParentInt.Child` and `ParentString.Child` are not the same and the compiler will reject any such subtyping attempt. Spring on the other hand sees the two children beans as being of the same type (even though they aren't); the \"disambiguation\" is solved using the bean name, here `childInt`.\r\n\r\nThis may be an already documented implementation limitation, but I did not find anything on the matter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/32417/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
