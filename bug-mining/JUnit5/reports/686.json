Description\n\nJUnit 4 allows running methods in parallel by setting a `RunnerScheduler` for ParentRunner subclasses. \nThis issue aim to implement this feature to improve test execution performance.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Implement parallel execution of test methods\n- Adjust existing tests to verify method parallelization\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x]  Implement custom RunnerScheduler using ExecutorService\n- [x]  Update tests to verify parallel method execution\n- [x]  Document usage and performance implications\n\n---\n\nThis issue is a follow-up task to the issue below.\n\n-
