on #4320.\n\nIn addition to the existing `@BeforeAll`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, and `@AfterAll` lifecycle methods, we should add introduce `@BeforeArgumentSet`/`@AfterArgumentSet` annotations that can be declared on `static` (unless `TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS` is used) methods of the test class that will be executed once _per argument set_ before/after all test methods and nested classes in a `@ParameterizedContainer` class.\n\nSince those methods are usually `static`, they won't have access to the resolved parameters. Therefore, and for compatibility with JUnit 4's `@BeforeParams`/`@AfterParams` methods, we should support injecting them as method parameters of those lifecycle methods.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Introduce `@BeforeArgumentSet`/`@AfterArgumentSet` lifecycle methods for `@ParameterizedContainer` classes\n- [x] Add support for passing the resolved arguments of the current invocation to those lifecycle methods","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
