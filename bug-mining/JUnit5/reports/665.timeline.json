Marc, happy New Year! I'm just back from the holidays to look at this. \r\n\r\nThe reason I asked about a runnable test is that my time is allocated to items that can result in a quick resolution, esp. as we're approaching RDP2. I don't think I need to run your test to prove it as I trust your test result. A runnable/standalone test, standalone meaning having no dependency on your test environment, would be very helpful for creating a quick patch. The issue is obvious, it's just that I'd like to put a test in that represents (hopefully exactly) the use case found in your test so that the same mistake won't happen again.
