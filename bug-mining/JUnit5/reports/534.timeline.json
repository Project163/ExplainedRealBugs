Furthermore, `@BeforeEach` methods from superclasses will be executed before `@BeforeEach` methods in subclasses.\r\n\r\nPrivate methods are executed, even though they should not be (?). The JavaDoc prohibits private methods but does not explain what will happen.\r\n\r\nJava defines overriding methods as: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.8.1, the JavaDoc uses the term \"overridden\" with a different meaning than Java. JLS even says: \r\n\r\n> Note that methods are overridden or hidden on a signature-by-signature basis. If, for example, a class declares two public methods with the same name ([§8.4.9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.9)), and a subclass overrides one of them, the subclass still inherits the other method.\r\n\r\nIn the previous issue #2390, it was suggested to also include mention of shadowing - which I think is also wrong. JLS already defines shadowing - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.4.1.\r\n\r\nBoth instances should be either fixed to be compliant with the documentation, or the documentation should be updated.\r\n\r\nOther annotations (`@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`, and `@AfterEach`) are expected to be affected too.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nLet's imagine two packages and a class in each:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage sup;\r\n\r\npublic class Sup {\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    MODSUP void before() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Before in Sup\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npackage sub;\r\nimport sup.Sup;\r\n\r\npublic class Sub extends Sup {\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void before() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Before in Sub\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    MODSUB void test() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Test\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then write a table of expected behavior based on the modifiers:\r\n\r\nSub \\ Sup | public | protected | none | private\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\npublic | Before in SubTest | Before in SubTest | Before in SupBefore in SubTest (*) | Before in SubTest\r\nprotected | compilation error | Before in SubTest | Before in SupBefore in SubTest (*) | Before in SubTest\r\nnone | compilation error | compilation error | Before in SupBefore in SubTest (*) | Before in SubTest\r\nprivate | compilation error | compilation error | Before in SupTest (*) | Test (*)\r\n\r\nThe combinations with (*) instead produce:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBefore in Sub\r\nTest\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.8.2\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Gradle, Java

Overview\r\n\r\nAfter fixing #3498, I realized that the same types of bugs exist for finding fields in a type hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe fix for fields should be analogous to the fix for methods: apply

other than `tempDir`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage demo.a;\r\n\r\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\r\n\r\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\r\n\r\nimport

Overview\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3532#issuecomment-1799138369, the search algorithms in JUnit 5 that are used to locate methods and fields have historically had the following undesirable characteristic.\r\n\r\nA field _supersedes_ (shadows, hides, overrides) a field with the same name in a superclass unless a filter (`Predicate`) is applied that ignores one of the fields (such as a `static` check or a check for the presence of a specific annotation).\r\n\r\nThis also applies to any methods looked up via JUnit 5's reflection support -- for example, lifecycle methods and test methods in JUnit Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe JUnit 5 team discussed this topic today and decided to revise our search algorithms to align with Java semantics regarding visibility and overriding. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we want to ensure that our search algorithms do not treat something as _overridden_ when it is not overridden according to the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS).\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, several currently unsupported use cases would become supported -- for example:\r\n\r\n- Two `@TempDir` fields with the same name in a superclass and subclass would both be injected.\r\n- Two `@BeforeEach` methods with the same name/signature in a superclass and subclass would both be invoked, if the `@BeforeEach` method in the superclass is package-private and the subclass resides in a different package (i.e., the `@BeforeEach` method in the subclass does not `@Override` the `@BeforeEach` method in the superclass according to the JVMS).\r\n\r\n## External Resources\r\n\r\n- [Java Virtual Machine Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.5): § 5.4.5, Overriding \r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #960\r\n- #2390\r\n- #2626\r\n- #3242\r\n- #3498\r\n- #3532 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Align method and field search algorithms with Java semantics regarding visibility/overridability.\r\n- [x] Introduce tests for overridden method support. See [comment](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3553#issuecomment-1892570732) below.\r\n- [x] Introduce a configuration parameter / system property -- for example, `junit.platform.reflection.search.useLegacySemantics = true` -- that allows a project to revert to the previous behavior.\r\n- [x] Document in User Guide.\r\n- [x] Document in Release Notes.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1805969060","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3242#issuecomment-1805969060","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3242","id":1805969060,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH85rpOak","user":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-10T15:46:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T15:46:20Z","body":"Closely

Overview\r\n\r\nIn #25966, we introduced support to validate that JUnit Jupiter test methods and lifecycle methods are not annotated with `@Autowired`, and we explicitly filtered out `private` methods since JUnit Jupiter has always _claimed_ that `private` test and lifecycle methods are not supported.\r\n\r\nHowever, by accident, `private` lifecycle methods are actually _supported_ even if discouraged.\r\n\r\nIn light of that, we should update our validation check to include `private` methods as well.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #25966\r\n-
