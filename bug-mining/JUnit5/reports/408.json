using JUnit 5.6.2.\r\n\r\nI work on an extension that needs to have access on  the invoked test method.\r\n\r\nFor standard tests, the `InvocationInterceptor.interceptTestMethod` gives access to a `ReflectiveInvocationContext<Method>` that gives access to the test method.\r\n\r\nFor dynamic tests, the `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest` don't include any `ReflectiveInvocationContext<Method>` so we cannot access the test method.\r\n\r\nNote that a `ReflectiveInvocationContext` is provided in almost all intercept methods except the dynamic test one.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to give access to the `DynamicTest` object itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
