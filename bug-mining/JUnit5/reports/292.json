Feature Request\r\n\r\nCurrently, in JUnit 4 it is not possible to have global timeouts for the tests. The `Timeout` rule does not guarantee that any `@After` method will be called. See\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues/1231#issuecomment-167437481\r\n\r\nand the recently updated\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Timeout-for-tests\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a global timeout in JUnit Jupiter. Even better, it would be great if it would be possible to set different global timeouts for `@BeforeEach` `@Test`, and `@AfterEach`, which could be overridden (if needed) directly in the test files via annotations.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #20 \r\n- #1246 \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/80/reactions","total_count":42,"+1":33,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":8,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/80/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
