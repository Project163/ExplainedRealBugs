Actual behavior\r\n\r\nI have a JUnit extension which implements the `TestInstancePostProcessor` and `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback`. When using this extension for a test class with inner nested test classes, if the lifecycle of the enclosing class is `PER_METHOD`, then an instance of the enclosing class is created for the tests in the nested class, as well as a nested instance for each or all of the tests (depending on the lifecycle of the nested class). The post-process hook is then called for the enclosing instance and the nested instances, but the pre-destroy hook is only called for the nested instances and not for the enclosing instance.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe post-process and pre-destroy hooks are called both for the nested instances as well as for the enclosing instance.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExample test which shows the behavior:\r\n```java\r\n@ExtendWith(OuterTests.LifecycleExtension.class)\r\nclass OuterTests {\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testOuter1() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"testOuter1\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testOuter2() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"testOuter2\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Nested\r\n    class InnerTests {\r\n        @Test\r\n        void testInner1() {\r\n            System.out.println(\"testInner1\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Test\r\n        void testInner2() {\r\n            System.out.println(\"testInner2\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static class LifecycleExtension implements TestInstancePostProcessor, TestInstancePreDestroyCallback {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void postProcessTestInstance(Object testInstance, ExtensionContext context) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"postProcess: \" + testInstance);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void preDestroyTestInstance(ExtensionContext context) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"preDestroy: \" + context.getRequiredTestInstance());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput for lifecycle = PER_METHOD for outer and inner class (indentations for better readability):\r\n```\r\npostProcess: mypackage.OuterTests@7bedc48a\r\n-- testOuter1\r\npreDestroy: mypackage.OuterTests@7bedc48a\r\n\r\npostProcess: mypackage.OuterTests@38e79ae3\r\n-- testOuter2\r\npreDestroy: mypackage.OuterTests@38e79ae3\r\n\r\npostProcess: mypackage.OuterTests@63070bab\r\n-- postProcess: mypackage.OuterTests$InnerTests@291b4bf5\r\n---- testInner1\r\n-- preDestroy: mypackage.OuterTests$InnerTests@291b4bf5\r\n\r\npostProcess: mypackage.OuterTests@2d2ffcb7\r\n-- postProcess: mypackage.OuterTests$InnerTests@762ef0ea\r\n---- testInner2\r\n-- preDestroy: mypackage.OuterTests$InnerTests@762ef0ea\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput for lifecycle = PER_CLASS for outer and inner class (indentations for better readability):\r\n```\r\npostProcess: mypackage.OuterTests@fa4c865\r\n-- testOuter1\r\n-- testOuter2\r\n\r\n-- postProcess: mypackage.OuterTests$InnerTests@2d2ffcb7\r\n---- testInner1\r\n---- testInner2\r\n-- preDestroy: mypackage.OuterTests$InnerTests@2d2ffcb7\r\npreDestroy: mypackage.OuterTests@fa4c865\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): JUnit Jupiter 5.7.0\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Maven 3.6.3, IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2, OpenJDK 11","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
