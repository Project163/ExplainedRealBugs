Overview\r\n\r\nWith the cron-based daily build of the [junit5-samples](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples) via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/junit-team/junit5-samples/builds) some basic integration checks are in place. The sample projects use very simple setups on purpose and cover mainly the minimal \"happy path\" available.\r\n\r\nThe main JUnit 5 project should provide and maintain an \"integration subproject\" containing \"end-to-end\" checks using various build tools that natively support the JUnit Platform. The \"integration subproject\" will contain many standalone projects that will be executed as an \"build integration test suite\", and the respective build results will be verified.\r\n\r\nSee similar checks that Surefire performs at https://github.com/apache/maven-surefire/tree/master/surefire-its\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Create `platform-tooling-support-tests` project\r\n- [x] Integrate `platform-tooling-support-tests` into build process -- as an opt-in build step\r\n- [x] Support usage of local (SNAPSHOT) build artifacts\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1429/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
