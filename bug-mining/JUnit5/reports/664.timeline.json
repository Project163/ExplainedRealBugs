Then I wouldn't use `Arguments.of()` for the second argument to convey your point, since nested `Arguments` are not supported.\r\n\r\nThus, if I understand you correctly, the following better illustrates your use case.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\tprivate static Stream<Arguments> fooData() {\r\n\t\treturn Stream.of(Arguments.of(\"1\", \"\"));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@ParameterizedTest\r\n\t@MethodSource(\"fooData\")\r\n\tvoid testFoo(String fooString) {\r\n\t\tassertFalse(fooString.isEmpty());\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat still ignores the `\"\"` argument, but that's by design.\r\n\r\nYour `testFoo()` method only accepts a single argument, and JUnit therefore only provides a single argument, namely the first argument available from each `Arguments` instance in the stream.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you keep the above revised `fooData()` method and modify `testFoo()` to accept two `String` arguments as follows...\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\t@ParameterizedTest\r\n\t@MethodSource(\"fooData\")\r\n\tvoid testFoo(String str1, String str2) {\r\n\t\tassertFalse(str1.isEmpty(), \"str1\");\r\n\t\tassertFalse(str2.isEmpty(), \"str2\");\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will then fail as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: str2 ==> expected: <false> but was: <true>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn general, JUnit Jupiter's `@ParameterizedTest` infrastructure invokes a parameterized test method with as many arguments as can be consumed by the declared formal parameters of the method. This is in order to support use cases where the author of the test may only be interested in the first `n` elements of the argument set -- for example, when a test is parameterized by CSV data.\r\n\r\nThe code which implements this logic can be viewed here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/264df92c85285e65e5cb557d17c9b85557ad6fdc/junit-jupiter-params/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/params/ParameterizedTestExtension.java#L152-L158\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> Since there are no suitable arguments for the indicated test method, I expected an error message. Instead I receive output that all tests pass. This is at best misleading.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we cannot throw an exception in such cases since it's an existing feature that people depend on.\r\n\r\nThough I suppose it would be possible to introduce a flag (`boolean` attribute) in `@ParameterizedTest` to fail the test if the method accepts fewer arguments than the number actually supplied.\r\n\r\nIs that a feature that you would be interested
