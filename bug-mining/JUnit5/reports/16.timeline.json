Every module has its own JAR. You can download the individual JARs from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.junit%22).\n\nIn addition, there is a [ZIP distribution](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/junit/junit-console/5.0.0-ALPHA/junit-console-5.0.0-ALPHA.zip) of junit-console that includes all of its dependencies in the `lib` folder but does not include any engines at the moment. In order to run JUnit 4 tests you'd have to add `junit-4.12.jar` and `junit4-engine.jar` to the classpath, for JUnit 5 you need to add `junit5-api.jar` and `junit5-engine.jar`.\n\nIf you use Maven or Gradle you can use the setup we provide in our [sample projects](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples).\n\nAre you looking for a single JAR that includes the contents of all the other JARs? If so, how would you use it? Would a ZIP file containing all of the individual JARs be of any use?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/179227687/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/179258242","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/146#issuecomment-179258242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/146","id":179258242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTI1ODI0Mg==","user":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T14:13:26Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T14:13:26Z","body":"Hassle-free usage in manually managed projects.

Status Quo\n\nBehind the scenes, the JUnit Gradle plugin uses the `ConsoleRunner` (from the `junit-console` module) to actually execute the test plan. Due to #146, the `junit-console` includes `junit4-engine`, `junit5-engine`, and `junit4-runner` as mandatory run-time dependencies. Consequently, the `junit4` and `junit5` engines are always on the classpath for the JUnit Gradle plugin, which means that those engines are _included_ by default. The `junit4` engine is therefore _included_ even if the `runJunit4` flag for the plugin has been explicitly set to `false`, which is both misleading and unacceptable.\n## Related Issues\n- #291\n- #295\n- #303 \n- #304 \n- #307\n## Deliverables\n- [x] Add a direct compile-time dependency on `junit-console` in `junit-gradle.gradle`.\n- [x] Refer to the `ConsoleRunner` via a class reference within the JUnit Gradle plugin instead of via a hard-coded string.\n- [x] Introduce a new `disableStandardTestTask` configuration flag for disabling execution of the standard Gradle `test` task; default the value of the flag to `true`.\n- [x] Remove the `runJunit4` configuration flag since it has been superseded by `engines { include ... }` and `engines { exclude ... }` support.\n- [x] Covert `version` property plugin configuration into a more appropriately named `platformVersion` property.\n- [x] Ensure that only the minimum set of dependencies on JUnit Platform modules is added to the classpath for the task created by the JUnit Gradle plugin.\n  - In other words, ensure that undesirable transitive dependencies of the `junit-console` module are no longer added to the classpath.\n  - See discussion in [Gradle Forum](https://discuss.gradle.org/t/how-to-add-plugins-dependencies-to-custom-task/18025)\n- [x] Ensure that standard project classpaths are no longer modified.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":696733212,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ2OTY3MzMyMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/696733212","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-18T14:04:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/226944325","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/146#issuecomment-226944325","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/146","id":226944325,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjk0NDMyNQ==","user":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-18T14:06:23Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T14:06:23Z","body":"Reopening
