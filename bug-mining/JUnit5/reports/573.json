Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCopying the relevant parts of the `RandomNumberExtension` example in the documentation [here](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/index.html#extensions-RandomNumberExtension):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass RandomNumberDemo {\r\n\r\n    // Use static randomNumber0 field anywhere in the test class,\r\n    // including @BeforeAll or @AfterEach lifecycle methods.\r\n    @Random\r\n    private static Integer randomNumber0;\r\n\r\n    // Use randomNumber1 field in test methods and @BeforeEach\r\n    // or @AfterEach lifecycle methods.\r\n    @Random\r\n    private int randomNumber1;\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass RandomNumberExtension\r\n        implements BeforeAllCallback, TestInstancePostProcessor, ParameterResolver {\r\n\r\n...\r\n    private void injectFields(Class<?> testClass, Object testInstance,\r\n            Predicate<Field> predicate) {\r\n\r\n        predicate = predicate.and(field -> isInteger(field.getType()));\r\n        findAnnotatedFields(testClass, Random.class, predicate)\r\n            .forEach(field -> {\r\n                try {\r\n                    field.setAccessible(true);\r\n                    field.set(testInstance, this.random.nextInt());\r\n                }\r\n                catch (Exception ex) {\r\n                    throw new RuntimeException(ex);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of issues with this code:\r\n\r\n1. `randomNumber0` is an Integer, so it's not injected.\r\n2. `findAnnotatedFields` is missing the fourth parameter, so it doesn't compile.\r\n3. If `randomNumber0` is removed completely from `RandomNumberDemo`, then `randomNumber1` is not injected. I believe the root cause is that `TestMethodTestDescriptor` does not invoke `TestInstancePostProcessor` (side note: even though it does invoke `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback`). Meanwhile, `ClassBasedTestDescriptor` does, which is why `randomNumber1` is populated when `randomNumber0` is present. I can't tell which part is wrong here: the documentation or the code.\r\n\r\nNote: The code in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3004#issuecomment-1215045050 fixes all these issues. The last issue is resolved by using `BeforeEachCallback` instead of `TestInstancePostProcessor`.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.9.3\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Eclipse 2023-03 (4.27.0)\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- <strike>Remove bugs from documentation</strike>\r\n- [x] Switch the example to use `BeforeEachCallback` instead of  `TestInstancePostProcessor`\r\n- [x] Fix implementation of `isInteger()` in `RandomNumberExtension` in the User Guide.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3433/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
