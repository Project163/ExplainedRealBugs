Overview\n\nIn #4550 we added support for JSpecify nullability annotations; however, the `reason` and `customReason` parameters in various `ConditionEvaluationResult` APIs do not signal that those values are permitted to be `null`.\n\nFor example, when migrating to JUnit 6.0 M1 I had to add the following suppression in Spring Framework's `DisabledInAotModeCondition`.\n\n```java\n@SuppressWarnings(\"NullAway\") // ConditionEvaluationResult.disabled(): customReason should be @Nullable\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4550 \n- #4715 \n-
