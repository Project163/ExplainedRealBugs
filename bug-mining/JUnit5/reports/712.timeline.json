Overview\r\n**Resolves #1851 #1914**\r\n\r\nSince provided executables for `assertThrows` invocations are marked as `noinline`, it is not possible to execute them with the same context as the call site. Thus it is not possible to call `assertThrows` on a suspended method from a `CoroutineContext`.\r\n\r\nBy including overloaded inline methods accepting the `Result<*>` parameter, it is possible to defer a `Throwable` being thrown until it can be evaluated in the java `Executable` instance, despite having already been executed in the calling context.\r\n\r\nThis approach resolves the issue of being unable to call `assertThrows` be suspended functions, without having to include an additional dependency on Coroutines, and inherits the calling Coroutine hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSolution provided alongside #1853 which resolves the same issue through use of `runBlocking`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License

would be careful with using runBlockingTest. It does a lot of things, one of them is overriding the behavior of delay(), to allow the test to control the passage of time across coroutines.  By default it makes all calls to delay() a no-op.\r\n\r\nAnyone who needs to wait in a test will get unexpected behavior if they use delay (which would be the recommended way of doing it).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/948868769/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"EanLombardo","id":4415227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4415227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo","html_url":"https://github.com/EanLombardo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EanLombardo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/950296681","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1914#issuecomment-950296681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1914","id":950296681,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH844pGBp","user":{"login":"jlink","id":103937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink","html_url":"https://github.com/jlink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-24T10:10:53Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T10:10:53Z","body":"Might be interesting to know that I implemented @IRus' suggestion in jqwik.net.
