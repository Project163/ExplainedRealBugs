This ```@TestRule``` allows you to disable a test rule if the JVM is in debug mode and has absolutely nothing to do with deciding what tests should be run.\r\n-   [x] ExpectedException - use [Assertions.expectThrows()](https://junit.ci.cloudbees.com/job/JUnit5/javadoc/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#expectThrows-java.lang.Class-org.junit.jupiter.api.Executable-) as described in section [3.4 Assertions](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#assertions) of the User Guide.\r\n-   [ ] ExternalResource\r\n  -   [ ] TemporaryFolder - Provide [TemporaryDirectory](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/459aefa6d5eb5838e8aa36423bfe386005df9bdf/junit-tests/src/test/java/org/junit/gen5/console/tasks/TempDirectory.java) which is used for internal JUnit 5 tests as part of https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples.  See https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/issues/4.\r\n-   [x] RuleChain - JUnit 5 extensions enable via @ExtendWith are executed in declaration order.\r\n-   [ ] Stopwatch - partially provided via the [TimingExtension](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#test-lifecycle-callbacks) in section [5.6.1 Before and After Test Execution Callbacks](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#test-lifecycle-callbacks) of the user guide.  See this comment: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/issues/4#issuecomment-190330403.  Reporting of the result state could be accomplished by injecting [TestReporter](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/junit-jupiter-api/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/TestReporter.java) via parameter resolution (using @BeforeAll?) but there are potentially use cases that can't be handled.\r\n-   [x] TestWatcher\r\n  -   [x] TestName - inject [TestInfo](https://junit.ci.cloudbees.com/job/JUnit5/javadoc/) into the test using parameter resolution.\r\n-   [x] Timeout - JUnit 4 allows the timeout to be specified via [@Test](http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/Test.html#timeout%28%29).  Is there an equivalent in JUnit 5?  For performance testing, it would also be nice to have the test fail if it exceeded a threshold.\r\n-   [x] Verifier\r\n  -   [x] ErrorCollector - use [Assertions.assertAll()](https://junit.ci.cloudbees.com/job/JUnit5/javadoc/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html#assertAll-java.lang.String-org.junit.jupiter.api.Executable...-) as described in section [3.4 Assertions](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#assertions) of the User Guide.\r\n## Related Issues\r\n- #169 \r\n## Related Blog Posts\r\n- http://www.codeaffine.com/2016/04/06/replace-rules-in-junit5/\r\n- http://blog.codefx.org/libraries/junit-5-conditions/\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":772505819,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDc3MjUwNTgxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/772505819","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-30T17:35:34Z","label":{"name":"Jupiter","color":"11ee99"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/248355513","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/219#issuecomment-248355513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/219","id":248355513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODM1NTUxMw==","user":{"login":"smoyer64","id":328333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64","html_url":"https://github.com/smoyer64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T16:28:55Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T16:28:55Z","body":"I wanted to add a use-case to this issue that was described during the \"Metrics-Driven Continuous Delivery in Practice [TUT5941]\" session at JavaOne.\n\nThe presenter's company (Dynatrace) has developed a custom @Ignore annotation which allows tests to be ignored only if the issue (in this case in Jira) it's testing against is still open.

are many possible ideas floating around the `@Disabled` annotation:\r\n\r\n* [X] disable tests by evaluating a script (e.g., JavaScript, Groovy, etc)\r\n  - See `@EnabledIf` and `@DisabledIf` in Jupiter 5.1\r\n* [X] disable tests on selected OS (#2, junit-team/junit5#219, [proof of concept](https://github.com/CodeFX-org/demo-junit-5/blob/master/src/main/java/org/codefx/demo/junit5/OsCondition.java))\r\n  - See `@EnabledOnOs` and `@DisabledOnOs` in Jupiter 5.1\r\n* [X] disable tests on selected Java versions\r\n  - See `@EnabledOnJre` and `@DisabledOnJre` in Jupiter 5.1\r\n* [X] system property matches a pattern ([comment in #219](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/219#issuecomment-226761964))\r\n  - See `@EnabledIfSystemProperty` and `@DisabledIfSystemProperty` in Jupiter 5.1\r\n* [X] environment variable matches a pattern ([comment in #219](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/219#issuecomment-226761964))\r\n  - See `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable` and `@DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable` in Jupiter 5.1\r\n* [X] disable all tests in a class except for one (junit-team/junit5#346, [proof of concept](https://github.com/selesy/junit5-extensions))\r\n  - not yet implemented, but tracked by #71\r\n* [X] current date/time matches some criteria, e.g. `@DisabledUntil` ([comment in #219](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/219#issuecomment-226761964)) ~> #366 \r\n  - See also: [@EnabledOnDayOfWeek](https://github.com/sbrannen/junit5-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/condition/EnabledOnDayOfWeek.java) and [@DisabledOnDayOfWeek](https://github.com/sbrannen/junit5-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/condition/DisabledOnDayOfWeek.java) ~> it's a fun idea, but unlikely to be actually useful\r\n* [X] until a Github/Gitlab (extensible) issue has been closed ~> #367\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable to create a universal `@DisabledIf` annotation that covers all of these cases but instead of going there from the outset, it might make more sense to tackle individual use cases first and look for room for generalization later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"nipafx","id":6537432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzc0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6537432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx","html_url":"https://github.com/nipafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-22T17:35:58Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T17:35:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/2","id":191074739,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTEwNzQ3Mzk=","number":2,"title":"DisabledOnOs","user":{"login":"nipafx","id":6537432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzc0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6537432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx","html_url":"https://github.com/nipafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":483815451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODM4MTU0NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/labels/%F0%9F%8F%97%EF%B8%8F%20type:%20enhancement","name":"🏗️

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing the existing JUnit 4 ```TestRules``` in #343, I completely missed the point of the ```DisableOnDebug``` rule.  It's purpose is to disable the encapsulated rule when the JVM is in debug mode and it has nothing to do with which tests are selected for execution.\r\n\r\n- (X) **Feature request.** I'd like to propose that there's an additional member added to the ```@ExtendWith``` annotation in the following form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nboolean disableOnDebug() default false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis flag would conditionally allow one or more ```Extension```s to be disabled when the JVM is in debug mode.  Code using this feature might look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@ExtendWith(WeldExtension.class)\r\n@ExtendWith(StopwatchExtension.class, disableOnDebug = true)\r\npublic void testSomething() { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change the ```@ExtendWith``` annotation.\r\n- [ ] Alter the Jupiter engine to ignore extensions during debug.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/668/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1071683831,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTA3MTY4MzgzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1071683831","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-06T20:33:28Z","milestone":{"title":"5.0
