Overview\r\n\r\nThe artifacts listed here https://github.com/junit-team/junit5#dependency-metadata should define their JPMS module names.\r\n\r\n> [...] the name of a module to be specified in the MANIFEST.MF file of a JAR file. If a JAR file with such a manifest entry is not a modular JAR (i.e., it has no module-info.class file), but is used as an automatic module, then the name of the automatic module is that specified in the manifest rather than that derived from the name of the JAR file itself. This would allow the maintainer of an existing library to specify a preferred module name simply by updating the library’s manifest.
