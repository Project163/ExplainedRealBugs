Pre R7 Core, a bundle would express a requirement on the `osgi.ee` namespace which indicated the bundle's expectations of what java packages it would possibly use. With R7 Core (and Java 9 at runtime), the bundle can specify the exact java packages it uses via Import-Package. For this to work, both the Java runtime must be Java 9 or later and the OSGi framework implementation must support R7 Core.\n\nIt sounds like for 6.0, you will require Java 17 at runtime. But I am not sure your bundles have any requirements on R7 Core (for example, import package of org.osgi.framework) since your bundles don't directly interact with the OSGi framework. So unless all your bundles will be importing `org.osgi.framework;version=[1.9,2)`, they can work on pre-R7 Core OSGi frameworks which do not understand importing of `java.*` packages. So not importing `java.*` packages makes your bundles more useful to consumers. And if your bundles only use java packages from the `java.base` module, then the java packages in that module is always present. I would guess most of your users will have the `java.se` module present which will contain all the java packages your bundles would use.\n\nIn hindsight, the default value of `-noimportjava` should probably have been `true` since most users will not need the fine grained support of importing individual java packages because their bundles will need to run on JPMS systems with a small subset of the \"standard\" SE modules.\n\n> Why does bnd use the Java runtime as its heuristic rather than the Java compatibility that gets written to OSGi metadata?\n\nIt may be the way you suggest. I don't work on Bnd any more, so my memory
