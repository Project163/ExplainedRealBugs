If it matches the conditions, perform the callback.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages :\r\n- have to use a proxy (which can get complicated).\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm going to try the first of the two approaches, what do you think?\r\n(Note that the above code is just written to check the approach, it's not the finished code).\r\n\r\nIf you have a better way, I'd love to hear about it, even if it's a completely different approach.\r\n\r\nThank
