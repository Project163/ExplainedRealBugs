`ReflectionUtils` supports resolving class based selectors such as `PackageSelector` and  `ClasspathRootSelector`.  These can be resolved using `findAllClassesInPackage` and `findAllClassesInClasspathRoot` respectively. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are no resource based equivalents to help resolve resources contained in a class path directory targeted by a `ClasspathResourceSelector` or `ClasspathRootSelector` e.g:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<Resource> findAllResourcesInPackage(String basePackageName, ResourceFilter resourceFilter)\r\n\r\nList<Resource> findAllResourcesInClasspathRoot(URI root, ResourceFilter resourceFilter) \r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this functionality is backed by the `ClasspathScanner` I believe it would be prudent to add this functionality prior to making the `ClasspathScanner` part of the public API as proposed in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3628. This would avoid breaking changes by adding more methods to an interface, or potential bug reports caused by a default implementation that always returns an empty collection of resources. \r\n\r\nAnd I would be happy to provide a PR that facilitates this.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Support for scanning class path resources through `ReflectionUtils` and `ClasspathScanner`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3630/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3630/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
