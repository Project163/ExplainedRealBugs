[JUnit user guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) has several, repeating accessibility issues, resulting in not fulfilling the \"AA\" requirements definied by WCAG (and picked up by laws, e.g. the German BITV 2.0).\r\n\r\nAccording to WAVE analysis there are 205 errors and 1174 contrast errors. After a quick view it seems that all of them go down to two things:\r\n\r\n* Empty links: Violates level A requirement \"2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)\" of WCAG\r\n* Very low contrast: Violates level AA requirement \"1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)\"\r\n\r\n![overallreport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4354359/197243718-a04d0068-4870-4c18-840b-23129c58a576.png)\r\n\r\nTo fix the empty links it's necessary to provide text within the link that describes the functionality and/or target of that link.\r\n\r\nTo fix the low contrast errors the CSS of the code examples should be adjusted to give a proper contrast. All low contrast errors I randomly checked were located in code examples have a contrast ratio of 4.49:1, but WVAG level AA requires to meet 4.5:1. So only slight adjustments should fix all of these errors. For example changing the current `#008080`  to `#005555` should result in a contrast fulfilling even AAA level.\r\n\r\n![lowcontrast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4354359/197243674-5bac56b0-c7c3-4889-aa33-08a085aa63a0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the 98 alerts the 85 layout tables warnings are problematic, as screen readers (like NVDA or JAWS) read out the table structure. also the fact that no valid HTML 5 with navigation and content regions / elements is definied is problematic for users who are in need of screen readers etc. as those tools could not identify the page structure.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
