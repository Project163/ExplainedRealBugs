The existing matchers of `@EnumSource` can't help here.\nAs Enum constants have a natural order, it would be useful to support a range in `@EnumSource`. If a bound is not specified, it is considered unbounded.\n\nFollowing example would work then: all constants of `ChronoUnit` starting at `WEEKS` aren't supported by `Instant.plus(..)`.\n```\nclass InstantTests {\n\n@EnumSource(from = \"WEEKS\")\n@ParameterizedTest\nvoid plus_unsupportedUnits(ChronoUnit unit) {\n    Instant now = Instant.now();\n    assertThrows(UnsupportedTemporalTypeException.class, () -> now.plus(1, unit));\n}\n...\n```\nCandidates are\n* `@EnumSource(from = \"..\", to = \"..\")`,\n* `@EnumSource(begin = \"..\", end = \"..\")` or\n* `@EnumSource(start = \"..\", end = \"..\")`\n* ...\n\nThe existing matchers could be applied to a specified range additionally.\n \n## Deliverables\n\n- [ ] `@EnumSource` with optional `from` and `to` attributes\n- [ ] Update documentation and release notes\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
