this issue over Twitter. The problem with `@author` tags is, that over time they generally turn into lies. If I look at some 5 year old code, with a hand full of `@author` tags, I can't tell who did what, and who's code is even still part of the class. I always interpreted their original intend to be a reference for people to ask questions in case something doesn't work anymore. But that's hardly ever truly useful even in a corporate environment - at least after a few years of change. As part of the source code's documentation `@author` tags are completely useless (in my opinion).\r\n\r\nIf you want't to show your oss-cred as a developer, you can always point to commits, pull requests, issues or the official mentions of your contribution on a contributor page. Pull requests and issues are especially useful for demonstrating what improvements you brought to an open source project.\r\n\r\n@Andrei94 I'm not sure about `@contributor`, but it would at least
