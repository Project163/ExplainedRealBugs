Overview\n\nWhile discussing #4714 with @sormuras, he inquired about the `'null'` display name, which sparked an idea...\n\nNamely, it would be quite nice to have an auto-quote feature for argument values in the display name for a `@ParameterizedClass` or `@ParameterizedTest`.\n\nI therefore propose that we introduce a `boolean quoteText() default true` attribute (or similar) in `@ParameterizedClass` and `@ParameterizedTest` which signals to the `ParameterizedInvocationNameFormatter` that it should wrap `CharSequence` values (naturally including `String`) in double quotes (`\"\"`) and wrap Character` values in single quotes (`''`).\n\nDefaulting to `true` would make this an opt-out feature, but we could of course default to `false` to make it an opt-in feature.\n\nThough, since we are introducing this in 6.0, perhaps it's better to make it an opt-out feature.\n\nNote, however, that a `null` `CharSequence`/`Character` value would continue to be displayed as `null`, not `\"null\"` or `'null'`.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4714 \n- #4783 \n- #4786

It's not actually specified, but basically the `toString()` representation should closely match what the user typed in the Java source code. This is probably best explained with an example.\n\nGiven this annotation declaration:\n\n```java\n@ValueSource(strings = { \"\", \" \", \"foo & \\\"bar\\\"\", \"\\t\", \"\\n\" })\n```\n\nCalling `toString()` on an instance of that annotation yields the following (_where I have omitted all attributes except `strings`_).\n\n```\n@org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ValueSource(strings={\"\", \" \", \"foo & \\\"bar\\\"\", \"\\t\", \"\\n\"})\n```\n\nThus, my goal for #4716 is to somewhat emulate that.\n\n----\n\nHowever, for _this_ issue I am tempted to increase the scope to display names in general and thus not just for parameterized classes and tests.\n\nFor Jupiter, in `DisplayNameUtils.determineDisplayName(...)` we _strip_ display names sourced from `@DisplayName`, but that does not strip internal whitespace. Thus a `\\n` enclosed in non-blank text will remain in the display name.\n\nAFAICT, we do not consistently strip leading and trailing whitespace from display names, either in Jupiter or in the Platform (but I may have overlooked something).\n\nIn any case, I think we should:\n\n1. Consistently strip leading and trailing whitespace from all display names.\n2. Consistently replace non-printable characters in all display names (after the previous stripping step).\n\nThough my question is: should we do this only in Jupiter or within JUnit 6 in general (for example, display names for suites, etc.)?\n\n----\n\nGetting back to the discussion of which CR/LF representation to use...\n\nWhen replacing non-printable characters in display names in general, I think it would be a bit confusing to see `\\n` in the _middle_ of a display name (i.e., not within a quoted string/character).\n\nFor example, if a display name is generated by calling `toString()` on an object that includes newlines in the string representation (for whatever reason), it might be better to replace `\\n` with `<LF>`.\n\nOf if some `DisplayNameGenerator` produced newlines (even if not recommended), the same would apply.\n\n----\n\n> I'm wondering, though, if anyone would pass `\"\\\\n\"` and be confused. However, that applies to all options.\n\nIndeed, if people are already escaping characters like that, it could potentially be confusing, but I don't see any way around that.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/3031581856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/3031710575","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4714#issuecomment-3031710575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4714","id":3031710575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH860tDtv","user":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-03T10:16:57Z","updated_at":"2025-07-03T10:16:57Z","body":"> When included within a quoted string or character, yes, I totally agree.\n\nThat's what I has in mind when answering.\n\n> Thus, my goal for [#4716](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4716) is to somewhat emulate that.\n\nThat looks very useful! 👍 \n\n> In any case, I think we should:\n> \n> 1.
