Overview\r\n\r\n- JUnit 5 version: **`5.2.0`**\r\n- Kotlin version: **`1.2.30`**\r\n\r\nHello, I am trying to use the [Programmatic Extension Registration via Static Fields](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-registration-programmatic-static-fields) to register an extension in tests written in the Kotlin programming language.  However, I cannot get the `beforeAll` method to be called.  Note that using the `@BeforeAll` annotation works fine.\r\n\r\nNote that to have \"static\" methods in Kotlin, one must use the `@JvmStatic` annotation inside an `object`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Working `@BeforeAll` annotation:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass TestBeforeAllAnnotation {\r\n    companion object {\r\n\r\n        var setMeBeforeAllTests :String? = null\r\n\r\n        @JvmStatic\r\n        @BeforeAll\r\n        fun annotatedBeforeAll() {\r\n            setMeBeforeAllTests = \"before\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun testAnnotatedBeforeAll() {\r\n        assertEquals(\"before\", setMeBeforeAllTests) // OK\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Non-working `BeforeAllCallback` extension registration\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass BeforeAllCallBackExtension : BeforeAllCallback {\r\n\r\n    val atConstructionTime = \"done\"\r\n\r\n    var fromBeforAllCall: String? = null\r\n\r\n    override fun beforeAll(context: ExtensionContext?) {\r\n        println(\"BEFORE ALL CALLED\")\r\n        fromBeforAllCall = \"before\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass TestProgrammaticExtension {\r\n    companion object {\r\n        @JvmStatic\r\n        @RegisterExtension\r\n        val extension = BeforeAllCallBackExtension()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun filedAtConstructionTimeWorks() {\r\n        assertEquals(\"done\", extension.atConstructionTime) // OK\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    fun fieldSetInCallBackFails() {\r\n        assertEquals(\"before\", extension.fromBeforAllCall) // FAILS\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1500/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
