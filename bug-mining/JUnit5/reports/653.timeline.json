I can work around it by adding `@FieldDefaults(makeFinal = false)` on the class, but I'd prefer to keep everything consistently final across the board if possible.\r\n\r\nIt would help if `@QuarkusComponentTest` would identify that an injectable constructor exists (whether by the presence of an `@Inject` annotation, a non-empty constructor or usages of `@InjectMock` on the arguments), and use that for initializing the class instance, injecting mocks as necessary.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nThe `MockitoExtension` is a decent example of how something like this can be achieved: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/main/subprojects/junit-jupiter/src/main/java/org/mockito/junit/jupiter/MockitoExtension.java#L208.\r\n\r\nIt supports constructor injection of mocks with `@Mock` on the arguments, though not the mockito version of `@InjectMocks`. When using this extension, I would typically setup Lombok with `lombok.copyableAnnotations += org.mockito.Mock`, which will copy the annotations from the fields the constructor generated by

know this was previously discussed on https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1568, but the discussion wasn't conclusive and the team seemed open to the change, so I'd like to re-open it for feedback.\r\n\r\nThis change would involve the test method being passed to all test instance construction related extensions, `TestInstanceFactory`, `TestInstancePreConstructCallback` and `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback`.\r\n\r\nAn example description of why this would be helpful is here: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/38336.\r\n\r\nThe summary is that some frameworks (like Quarkus) allow for the CDI container to be configured by the test method when the test lifecycle is `PER_METHOD`, like to override configuration properties for a specific test case, before initializing the container. This allows for beans customized to a specific test case to be injected into the class, with all the appropriate configurations already applied.\r\n\r\nThis is possible with a fully mutable test class where Quarkus can use `BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` to set up / tear down  the container before the tests run and ensure all beans are injected, but that breaks down when all fields in the class are final. \r\nJust as an example, I usually set `lombok.config` settings `lombok.fieldDefaults.defaultFinal` and `lombok.fieldDefaults.defaultPrivate` to `true`, so all fields are `private` and `final` by default in the entire project, including all tests, which then means I have to disable that by putting `@FieldDefaults(makeFinal = false)` on each test class using that functionality, which is a bit inconvenient (and keeping fields mutable isn't my preference).\r\n\r\nIf the test method was passed to the test instance factory extensions, then this would allow for a CDI container to be configured on a per test basis while at the same time maintaining an immutable class.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] `TestInstanceFactory#createTestInstance` should receive the test method through `ExtensionContext#getTestMethod`\r\n- [ ] `TestInstancePreConstructCallback#preConstructTestInstance` should receive the test method through `ExtensionContext#getTestMethod`\r\n- [ ] `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback#preDestroyTestInstance` should receive the test method through `ExtensionContext#getTestMethod`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12844254347,"node_id":"DEME_lADOAbwRH85v8OmazwAAAAL9k8SL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/12844254347","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-17T07:56:30Z","milestone":{"title":"5.11

Overview\r\n\r\nResolve #1568.\r\nResolve #2970.\r\nResolve #3445.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the instance creation into the execution context of the test method. This affects the following callbacks:\r\n\r\n* `TestInstancePreConstructCallback`\r\n* `TestInstanceFactory`\r\n* `ParameterResolver` (when resolving parameters for the constructor)\r\n* `TestInstancePostProcessor`\r\n\r\nAssuming the test is using `TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_METHOD` (the default), these callbacks will now receive the `ExtensionContext` for the currently executed test method. This has the following effects:\r\n\r\n* The callbacks can now access `ExtensionContext.getTestMethod()`\r\n* `ExtensionContext.getTestClass()` and `TestInstanceFactoryContext.getTestClass()` are no-longer interchangeable\r\n* `ExtensionContext.getTestClass()` now returns the (nested) class of the currently executed test\r\n* Instances of `CloseableResource` which are added to the store will now be closed at the end of the test execution\r\n\r\nIf the test is using `TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS`, the behavior is unaltered.\r\n\r\nNot sure if the change is considered API breaking. The previous behavior was rather unintuitive and not explicitly documented. However, the example at `TestInfoDemo` is no-longer valid and has been changed as part of the PR. I also think there is a good chance that there are a few extensions in the wild which rely on the previous behavior, since the behavior was in place for multiple years.

I don't think this can be changed in general since it could potentially break existing extensions (as you've pointed out in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1568#issuecomment-2381455919). The reason these extension method are always called with the class-scoped `ExtensionContext` is to make them agnostic of the configured test instance lifecycle.\r\n\r\nInstead, I think we need to provide a way for an extension to opt-in to getting the closest extension context or even failing if the test instance lifecycle is `PER_CLASS`. This could be achieved by an annotation on the `ExtensionContext` parameter of the implementing method or on the extension class. For example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal class MyExtension implements ParameterResolver {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Object resolveParameter(\r\n\t\tParameterContext parameterContext,\r\n\t\t@TestScoped ExtensionContext extensionContext\r\n\t) {\r\n        return extensionContext\r\n                .getStore(NAMESPACE)\r\n                .getOrComputeIfAbsent(ParameterWrapper.class)\r\n                .parameter;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\t// ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm open to other suggestions, though.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/2387853283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14484160606,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAbwRH85v8OmazwAAAANfUsBe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/14484160606","actor":{"login":"JojOatXGME","id":1288216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODgyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1288216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME","html_url":"https://github.com/JojOatXGME","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JojOatXGME/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-02T07:58:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
