Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\n\r\nThe class `org.junit.platform.launcher.TestIdentifier` contains a customized serialization strategy that uses a separate object class to represent the object serialized form. However, the deserialization part of that class wrongly assumes that the `parentId` property, which is clearly optional (i.e. nullable), is not `null` (by way of unconditionally dereferencing it in order to call `toString`). This causes a `NullPointerException` in certain kinds of Quarkus tests (see quarkusio/quarkus#23612, specifically [this comment](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/23612#issuecomment-2115336073)) which lately have begun to use serialization to transport objects to the Quarkus class loader during testing.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Build [Quarkus](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus) (skip tests with `mvn install -DskipTests`; warning: this takes a while)\r\n- Check out [Quarkus Super Heroes Demo](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-super-heroes)\r\n- Go to `rest-fights` directory\r\n- Edit the `pom.xml` to change `quarkus.platform.groupId` to `io.quarkus` and `quarkus.platform.version` to `999-SNAPSHOT`\r\n- `mvn install`, observe NPE test failures\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.10.2, but bug also occurs in `HEAD`\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Maven (plus Quarkus)\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix NPE by correcting deserialization logic (patch will be supplied)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
