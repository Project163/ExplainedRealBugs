the reason that it _works_ for your `t1()` method is purely by coincidence due to the fact that JUnit has to use reflection to invoke any test method. Note that the same holds for any testing framework using reflection to invoke test methods (e.g., JUnit 4, JUnit Jupiter, TestNG, etc.).\r\n\r\nSo, although you may consider that to be a feature, it is in fact an unavoidable behavior of any such testing framework.\r\n\r\nIn other words, this is not actually supported by design.\r\n\r\n@sormuras, I don't think we need to make any changes to `ReflectionUtils` or to how dynamic tests are executed.\r\n\r\nIn general, whenever one uses reflection to invoke a method, the onus is on that person to properly handle any exceptions thrown during the reflective call, and that includes unwrapping of any `InvocationTargetException`.\r\n\r\nThus, the actual solution to this issue is not to write your own reflective code for invoking methods in `Assertions` but rather to simply delegate to `ReflectionSupport` to ensure that the `InvocationTargetException` is properly unwrapped.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following should work for you in both cases.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nReflectionSupport.invokeMethod(method, null, 1,
