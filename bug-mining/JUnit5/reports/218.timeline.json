We use it rather extensively internally within the JUnit test suite; however, we have not published it.\r\n\r\nWe realize that extension authors actually need something along those lines, but we just haven't had the time to polish it, document it, and publish it.\r\n\r\nPlus, it might need an overhaul in terms of design in order to serve a wider audience than just the core committers.\r\n\r\nIf

This comment is out-of-date and does not reflect the current state of this feature, see the most recent **Specification Overview** comment further down this thread for accurate information)_\r\n\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n~~Provide basic functionality that replicates junit4's `@ClassRule` lifecycle by implementing an [`Extension`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions) for [`BeforeAllCallback`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/BeforeAllCallback.html) and [`AfterAllCallback`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/AfterAllCallback.html) dubbed `DockerComposeExtension` that uses reflection on the junit5 class to manipulate docker compose / machine state.  Basic expected usage is outlined below.~~\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n```java\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;\r\nimport com.palantir.docker.compose.DockerComposeExtension;\r\n\r\n@ExtendWith(DockerComposeExtension.class)\r\nclass Junit5Tests {\r\n\r\n     // The DockerComposeExtension will reflect on static fields for Junit5Tests\r\n     // and control state as class container starts (before all tests) and when class container stops (after all tests)\r\n     static final DockerComposeRule DOCKER_COMPOSE = DockerComposeRule.builder()\r\n                                   // All the usual stuff\r\n                                   .build();\r\n\r\n     @Test\r\n     void testThing() {\r\n          // Standard test\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     @ParameterizedTest\r\n     void testParameterized(String input) {\r\n           // Parameterized test bound to the test class container lifecycle\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     @TestFactory\r\n     Stream<DynamicTest> testFactory() {\r\n          // Also should support @TestFactory since it's also bound to the parent class container lifecycle\r\n     }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n~~- [ ] Tests for user fail cases of `DockerComposeExtension`~~\r\n~~- [ ] Tests for expected correct behaviour of `DockerComposeExtension` used with `DockerComposeRule`~~\r\n~~- [ ] (maybe?) Implement a junit4 `@Rule` equivalent `Extension` that uses [`BeforeEachCallback`](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/BeforeEachCallback.html) and [`AfterEachCallback`]~~(http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/AfterEachCallback.html)\r\n~~- [ ] Fix Builder pattern on `DockerComposeRule` (Would love to get feedback on this, since I keep getting this error when trying to replicate the current Builder in junit4 version:~~\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-01-26 at 5 49 07

the best I can recommend is:\r\n\r\n- review your own needs\r\n- review what can already be done with the `ExecutionEventRecorder `\r\n  - e.g., by reviewing the API and seeing how it is physically used within JUnit's test suite\r\n- review what third parties have done\r\n  - e.g., what @TimvdLippe linked to and things like I have done [in Spring's test suite](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/71cacff8c2f83884c31d9fd5ea2d67e4e1bb5a7f/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/junit/jupiter/FailingBeforeAndAfterMethodsSpringExtensionTestCase.java#L96-L131)\r\n\r\nThen
