Overview\r\n\r\nMany times I run into a situation where some test should be repeated only for a subset of enum values. Currently we can filter which values should be used for a test using the `names` attribute, but this solution has one big drawback. Every time someone adds a new value to the enum, the same value must be added to the test in the `names` attribute. If the developer forgets to do so, the test may raise a false positive result and potentially lead to a bug.\r\n\r\nIf the `@EnumSource` annotation allowed to specify which enum values should be excluded from a test, the newly added values would be covered automatically. It would be nice if the API allowed us to specify whether values in the `names` attribute is the list of values that should be included or excluded from a test. For instance, it might be an additional boolean attribute.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/850/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
