Overview\r\n\r\nWhile working on the fix for #2645, I realized that our annotation search algorithms that fall back to searching on _enclosing classes_ also find annotations on enclosing classes even if the current nested class is a static nested class.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following test case, the test method in `InnerNestedTests` passes; whereas, the test method in `StaticNestedTests` fails.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@DisplayNameGeneration(ReplaceUnderscores.class)\r\nclass DisplayNameGenerationInheritanceTests {\r\n\r\n\t@Nested\r\n\tclass InnerNestedTests {\r\n\t\t@Test\r\n\t\tvoid this_is_a_test(TestInfo testInfo) {\r\n\t\t\tassertThat(testInfo.getDisplayName()).isEqualTo(\"this is a test (TestInfo)\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// @DisplayNameGeneration(Standard.class)\r\n\tstatic class StaticNestedTests {\r\n\t\t@Test\r\n\t\tvoid this_is_a_test(TestInfo testInfo) {\r\n\t\t\tassertThat(testInfo.getDisplayName()).isEqualTo(\"this_is_a_test(TestInfo)\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne could of course argue that this is be design; however, I'm not convinced that `@DisplayNameGeneration` and `@IndicativeSentencesGeneration` should be _inherited_ from an enclosing static class or top-level class if the current class is not an inner class.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the Spring Framework's testing support, I only search for an annotation on the enclosing class if the current class is an _inner class_:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/df588e030f069dd31997ff747839f1d8d5d8d7c7/spring-test/src/main/java/org/springframework/test/context/TestContextAnnotationUtils.java#L398-L401\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Decide if want to retain the current semantics.\r\n- <strike>[ ] If so, document those semantics for `@DisplayNameGeneration` and `@IndicativeSentencesGeneration` and anywhere else we employ such a search algorithm.</strike>\r\n- [x] If not, change the algorithm to match the behavior in the Spring Framework and document the new semantics.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
