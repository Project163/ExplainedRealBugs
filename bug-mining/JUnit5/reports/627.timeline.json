Overview\r\n\r\nIn the following code snippet, the Weld CDI system provides a `ParameterResolver` for the third parameter in the `parametersTakePriorityOverInjection()` method.  Since the```@TestTemplate``` \"knows\" that it's producing parameters for the first two parameters via its ```ArgumentSource```, it shouldn't call either the `supportsParameter()` or `resolvesParameter()` methods of Weld's `ParameterResolver`.  Other registered ```ParameterResolver```s should only be called for parameters with indexes greater than one.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ExtendWith(WeldJunit5Extension.class)\r\npublic class ParameterizedTestCompatibilityTest {\r\n\r\n\tstatic final String SENTENCE = \" is a greek letter.\";\r\n\r\n\t@ParameterizedTest\r\n\t@CsvSource({\r\n\t\t\t\"Alpha, 0\",\r\n\t\t\t\"Beta, 1\",\r\n\t\t\t\"Gamma, 2\"\r\n\t})\r\n\tvoid parametersTakePriorityOverInjection(String letter, int ordinal, String sentence) {\r\n\t\tassertTrue(letter.length() >= 4);\r\n\t\tassertTrue(ordinal >= 0 && ordinal <= 2);\r\n\t\tassertEquals(SENTENCE, sentence);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Produces\r\n\t@ApplicationScoped\r\n\tString produceSentence() {\r\n\t\treturn \" is a greek letter.\";\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run, this code currently throws a ```ParameterResolutionException``` with the message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDiscovered multiple competing ParameterResolvers for parameter [java.lang.String arg0] in executable [void org.jboss.weld.junit5.compatibility.ParameterizedTestCompatibilityTest.parametersTakePriorityOverInjection(java.lang.String,int,java.lang.String)]: org.jboss.weld.junit5.WeldJunit5Extension, org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTestParameterResolver\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is somewhat related to #935 but occurs when additional parameters are correctly placed after those injected by the ```TestTemplate```.\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\n- `junit-jupiter-api`: 5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.1 M1\r\n- `junit-jupiter-params`: 5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.1 M1\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #935\r\n-

for parameters that will be satisfied by an ```ArgumentSource```.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-28T16:55:44Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T16:55:44Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weld/weld-testing/issues/3","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weld/weld-testing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weld/weld-testing/issues/3/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weld/weld-testing/issues/3/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weld/weld-testing/issues/3/events","html_url":"https://github.com/weld/weld-testing/issues/3","id":209463045,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDk0NjMwNDU=","number":3,"title":"Create
