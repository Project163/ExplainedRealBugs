like to test some code that behaves in different ways depending on the version of the JRE on which it's running. In my particular case, the code behaves in one way on Java 12 and earlier and in another on Java 13 and later. We have CI jobs that test on Java 8, 11, 12, and 13 (we'll probably drop 12 soon due to it being superseded by 13).\r\n\r\nAs CI jobs on new JREs are added and removed, I'd prefer for it not to be necessary to change the code to make sure that the right tests are enabled. As far as I can tell, even if `@EnabledOnJre` and `@DisabledOnJre` were repeatable, this goal would not be met. Instead, what I'd really like to be able to do is specify a (possibly open-ended) range of JREs on which a test should be enabled or disabled. In my particular case being able to enable a test on JRE 12 and earlier and another on JRE 13 and later would be sufficient, but I'm sure there are other use cases that would benefit from support for closed ranges.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Support for enabling or disabling a test on a range of JREs\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2016/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
