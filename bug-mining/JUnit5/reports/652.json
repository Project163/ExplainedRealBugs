version 5.11.x, if a field is meta-annotated with multiple `@ExtendWith` annotations, JUnit fails to detect them.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be in `ExtensionUtils#streamExtensionFilteringFields`, which does not take into account repeatable annotations:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/8e9094d60fa7964e635c6f4e91b7241266b3f09e/junit-jupiter-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/descriptor/ExtensionUtils.java#L204-L209\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Meta-annotate some test class fields with multiple `@ExtendWith` annotations:\r\n\r\n   ```java\r\n   @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n   @ExtendWith(Extension1.class)\r\n   @ExtendWith(Extension2.class)\r\n   public @interface ComposedAnnotation {}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   ```java\r\n   public class TestClassWithFields {\r\n\r\n     @ComposedAnnotation\r\n     private static int staticFieldMetaAnnotatedTwice;\r\n\r\n     @ComposedAnnotation\r\n     private int instanceFieldMetaAnnotatedTwice;\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run the following test cases: \r\n\r\n   ```java\r\n   class ExtensionsUtilsTests {\r\n     @Test\r\n     void discoverExtensionsOnStaticFields() {\r\n       ExtensionRegistrar registrar = mock();\r\n       ExtensionUtils.registerExtensionsFromStaticFields(registrar, ClassWithFields.class);\r\n       verify(registrar).registerExtension(Extension1.class);\r\n       verify(registrar).registerExtension(Extension2.class);\r\n     }\r\n     @Test\r\n     void discoverExtensionsOnInstanceFields() {\r\n       ExtensionRegistrar registrar = mock();\r\n       ExtensionUtils.registerExtensionsFromInstanceFields(registrar, ClassWithFields.class);\r\n       verify(registrar).registerExtension(Extension1.class);\r\n       verify(registrar).registerExtension(Extension2.class);\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): Jupiter 5.11.1 / Platform 1.11.1\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Maven\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4054/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
