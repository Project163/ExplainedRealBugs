@TWiStErRob,\n\n> So I would like to kindly ask for a way to silence this deprecation\n\nI think that's a great idea, and in fact... we had already discussed this topic, but I forgot to raise an issue.\n\nSo, thanks for creating this ticket! 👍 \n\n> * [ ] An opt-out property.\n> * [ ] Automatic detection of Robolectric/Android would be ideal.\n\nThis is in no way specific to Android. So, I don't think we should introduce any automatic opt out for Android.\n\nFor example, we ran into the same issue in the Spring Framework. We have officially deprecated our support for JUnit 4 in Spring; however, we still maintain the support we have. For the Spring Framework build we chose to fail the build for all JUnit discovery issues; however, that broke the build when we upgraded to JUnit 6, and I had to introduce the following _workaround_.\n\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/30db2e4fb5e993ba6ada58d2d55ca4e82297e615/spring-test/spring-test.gradle#L113-L115\n\nOf course, I don't actually consider that a viable workaround since it changes the severity for the entire `spring-test` module.\n\nSo, instead of an opt-out property, I think we should introduce a general purpose mechanism that allows projects to either suppress or alter the severity level for specific features.\n\nThis could be something analogous to how logging frameworks allow developers to configure the log level for specific log categories.\n\nThus, I envision some way to configure something along the lines of the following that would change the severity for the JUnit Vintage engine.\n\n```properties\norg.junit.vintage.engine.deprecation = none\n```\n\nFor example, the \"none\" value _could_ be a new enum constant in [`DiscoveryIssue.Severity`](https://docs.junit.org/current/api/org.junit.platform.engine/org/junit/platform/engine/DiscoveryIssue.Severity.html) which would mean that the given _discovery issue category_ is disabled.\n\nOf course, it's also imaginable that one could override the severity of a given _discovery issue category_ -- for example, by changing the default severity for the Vintage engine (which is hard coded in `VintageDiscoverer`) from `INFO` to `ERROR`.\n\n```properties\norg.junit.vintage.engine.deprecation = error\n```\n\nI think the prefixes for the categories should align with the package names for the features in question, and the last part (\"deprecation\" in the above examples) should succinctly describe the feature, analogous to the names we come up with configuration
