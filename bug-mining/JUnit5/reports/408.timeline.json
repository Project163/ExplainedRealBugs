`interceptDynamicTest` contains the name of the dynamic test but not the `Executable`.\r\n\r\nI'm working on QuickPerf and in certain circumstances we need to execute the test in a different VM so we skip the invocation and directly execute the test method. This works for standard tests invocation as we have the invocation context to access the test method but for Dynamic test we don't have access to the invocation context nor the dynamic test `Executable`.\r\n\r\nSure, we can use the ExtensionContext to retrieve the test factory method, execute it and get the right dynamic test, but this is a lot to do so having an invocation context or the `Executable` would be an easier to use
