Overview\n\nThis is a first step towards a Degraph Gradle plugin as discussed in #483. It adds a `degraph` task to every project which ensures that the code is cycle-free. We no longer need to scan the whole classpath as each project is checked individually. This makes builds quite a bit faster.\n\nAs you can see the DegraphCheck task is still hardcoded with the configuration for the JUnit project. We'd need to discuss how to model these constraints. In the simplest case we could just have a dedicated configuration file, like Degraph [already has](http://blog.schauderhaft.de/degraph/documentation.html#configuration-file) for visulization.\n\n---\n\nI hereby agree to the terms of the JUnit Contributor License

the discussion from https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/483:\n\nIt would be cool if Degraph came with a Gradle plugin that allowed users to check their Java code for violations. I did a very rough sketch of a [Degraph task](https://github.com/oehme/junit5/blob/15e5ba83a81ccf8e392257bd59c8c1b58b921bf2/gradle/degraph.gradle) in the JUnit repository.\n\nIdeally the plugin should have the following characteristics:\n- Users have a simple way to define slicings and constraints (doesn't need to be a Groovy DSL. Gradle's checkstyle plugin uses checkstyle.xml config for instance)\n- for each Java sourceSet, a Degraph check task is automatically created \n- the Degraph check tasks are hooked into the Java plugin's `check` task\n- the plugin works with future version of Degraph without needing to be upgraded itself\n- The plugin does not depend on Degraph directly. Instead it resolves it at runtime and invokes it in a forked process. This way it does not pollute the plugin classpath (ASM is especially problematic, as so many tools depend on so many different versions of it)\n- (If Degraph is extensible?) users can write custom extensions in the project being checked\n\nThe DSL could be as simple as this, assuming the configuration is written in an XML file. The rest is wired up automatically.\n\n```\ndegraph {\n  version = '1.0.0' //use some hardcoded default if the user doesn't specify\n  configuration = \"$rootDir/gradle/config/degraph.xml\"\n}\n```\n\nThe plugin and task should be pretty straightforward. The only thing I'm not sure about is: Is there already a configuration file format that allows users to specify slicings and constraints? Is there a class with a main method that fails if violations are found?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riy/degraph/issues/69/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/riy/degraph/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/268790175","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/483#issuecomment-268790175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/483","id":268790175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2ODc5MDE3NQ==","user":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-22T12:30:32Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T12:30:32Z","body":"@schauder
