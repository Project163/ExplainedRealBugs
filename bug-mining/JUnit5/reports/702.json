Platform should provide an extensible mechanism (`ServiceLoader`?) so that user code can create \"closeable resources\" that are injected as part of the context received by `TestEngine` implementations.\r\n\r\nThis feature is analogous to the `ExtensionContext.Store` concept from Jupiter but takes it to the Platform level. Moreover, it allows to reuse the same resource across multiple executions in a `LauncherSession`. We should advocate that resources stored in such a key-value store be immutable until their destruction. If such resources implement `AutoCloseable` they will get closed immediately before the `LauncherSession` they belong to is closed.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2816/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
