the [Javadoc for the `Assertions` class](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html), the following is mentioned:\r\n\r\n> A *failed* assertion will always throw `AssertionFailedError` or a subclass thereof.\r\n\r\nJunit doesn't declare that `AssertionFailedError` class, nor does the JDK (see [Junit's Javadoc](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/allclasses-frame.html) and [JDK's Javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/allclasses-frame.html)).\r\n\r\nSo where is that class defined? Can you please add links in the Javadoc to the class you're actually referencing?
