I don't think we have any tests that ensure we only use the attached class loader for loading the methods etc. for that test class.\r\n\r\nI think it would be enough. Once the test engine has a concrete `Class` instance the classloader issues don't matter as much - it only matteres when you're using `selectClass(String)`.\r\n\r\nIn my case, it certainly was enough; and while I'm not intimately familiar with PowerMock, it is possible that this would also be sufficient to solve that issue (#201) as well (at least for those doing test discovery directly in code) by passing in the PowerMock classloader to all test classes with power mocks using `selectClass(ClassLoader, String)`.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to put a PR together for consideration by the team.

want to run a set of tests where each test is executed multiple times and each time the test class would be loaded using a different classloader. That is, given test classes A, B and C, I want to create two executions for each class where I would load them with a different, custom classloader for one of those executions.\r\n\r\nOne way to achieve this is to implement a test engine that would delegate discovery and execution to an existing test engine and to intercept the discovery phase (where the test classes are loaded). \r\nGiven I have an `EngineDiscoveryRequest` with some class selectors, in the test engine's `discover` method, I can call the target engine's `discover(request, id)` multiple times, giving a unique id for each execution that I want to create. I can then aggregate the returned test descriptors and the tests will be executed multiple times.\r\n\r\nFor the classloading part, the test classes are loaded in `ClassSelector` lazily whenever `getJavaClass()` is called, which happens when the engine is discovering tests. If the class selectors that arrive to my custom test engine have only class names set, the classes will not have been loaded yet and there I can influence the classloader to use by setting it using `Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(...)` before delegating the discovery. This works just for one execution though as the loaded classes will be cached in the current discovery request. From here, in order to create the second execution and have the classes loaded using a different classloader, I have to create a new `EngineDiscoveryRequest` based on existing one and create new `ClassSelectors` from existing ones using `DiscoverySelectors.selectClass(selector.getClassName())`. There doesn't seem to be an API to create a new discovery request based on existing one for such use case. One alternative that works is to decorate an existing `EngineDiscoveryRequest` by implementing `EngineDiscoveryRequest` and delegating everything but `getSelectorsByType(...)` to the existing request.\r\n\r\nWhile I seem to be able to achieve what I'm after in the end, I am wondering if this can be simplified.\r\nFor example, if the `ClassSelector` would not cache the loaded test class itself, I would be able to reuse the existing discovery request by setting the classloader on the current thread for each discovery iteration.\r\nOr perhaps an API could be exposed that would allow setting the classloader for a discovery request and then to create a new discovery request based on an existing one - something along the lines of `DiscoveryRequests.from(existingRequest).withClassLoader(...).build()`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2538/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/840759054","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1987#issuecomment-840759054","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1987","id":840759054,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MDc1OTA1NA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-13T18:48:12Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T18:48:12Z","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.
