Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Configure Gradle build to generate PDF version of the User Guide.\r\n- Use the `rouge` syntax highlighting support for PDFs.\r\n  - Since `rouge` is not yet supported for the `html5` _backend_, we would need to have separate configurations for HTML and PDF; see https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/issues/28#issuecomment-25956045\r\n  - Will be addressed in #777.\r\n- Use the `rouge` syntax highlighting support for HTML.\r\n  - Will be addressed in #777.\r\n- [x] Determine why `component-diagram.svg` is not embedded in the generated PDF.\r\n  - See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/271.\r\n- [x] Ensure that `component-diagram.svg` gets embedded in the generated PDF.\r\n  - See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/271#issuecomment-291992364 for details.\r\n- [x] Construct links to JavaDoc API as absolute URLs instead of the relative links used in the HTML version of the User Guide.\r\n- Determine if special characters (e.g., emoji from custom display names and glyphs used with `unicode` mode for the `ConsoleLauncher`) can be displayed in the generated PDF.\r\n  - See discussion in https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/issues/323.\r\n  - Will be addressed in #2315.\r\n- [x] Publish PDF version of the User Guide alongside the HTML version.\r\n  - Currently published as http://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/index.pdf\r\n  - [x] ~Rename the generated `index.pdf` file to something like `junit-user-guide-5.0.0-M5.pdf`.~

Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe your changes here and list any open questions you might have. -->\r\n\r\nHello! This commit solves the linked issue. Though here are some things that I wanted to point out. \r\n\r\nI had to point to the fonts directory at the `documentation.gradle.kts` file because I was getting errors saying that \r\n**GEM_FONTS_DIR** was not found. \r\n\r\nAfter update, I had to download the default fonts from https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/tree/master/data/fonts  \r\n\r\nI also changed the \"rare\"  Japanese charset, U+FF0 emoji. \r\n\r\nHere: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/v1.5.x/docs/theming-guide.adoc#applying-your-theme it says that one can do `pdf-fontsdir=\"path/to/fonts;GEM_FONTS_DIR\"` yet it did not worked. \r\n\r\nYet this commit solves the emoji problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License
