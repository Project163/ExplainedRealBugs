Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following Test Case:\r\n```java\r\nassertTrue(127 == 127);    // succeeds\r\nassertSame(127, 127);      // succeeds\r\n\r\nassertTrue(128 == 128);    // succeeds\r\nassertSame(128, 128);      // fails\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Please insert a code snippet or a link to another repo along with instructions how to reproduce the issue here. The example should be minimal, complete and verifiable (see https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). -->\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): JUnit Jupiter Version 5.9.3\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: IntelliJ IDEA\r\n\r\nThis is a similar issue to: https://github.com/assertj/assertj/issues/2887\r\n\r\nIt appears to be the same kind of autoboxing caching issue due to `Object` being used in `assertSame`. This also means that, as mentioned in the issue, it not only affects this exact case, but also any case mentioned in JLS section [5.1.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.7):\r\n\r\n> If the value p being boxed is an integer literal of type int between -128 and 127 inclusive ([§3.10.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.1)), or the boolean literal true or false ([§3.10.3](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.3)), or a character literal between '\\u0000' and '\\u007f' inclusive ([§3.10.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.4)), then let a and b be the results of any two boxing conversions of p. It is always the case that a == b.\r\n\r\nThis means that for example, the following case is also affected:\r\n```java\r\nassertTrue('ç' == 'ç');  // succeeds\r\nassertSame('ç', 'ç');    // fails\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] assertSame(128, 128); passes along with other cases in the JLS section [5.1.7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.7)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
