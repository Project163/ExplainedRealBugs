current set of schemes for [URI Test Sources for Dynamic Tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-dynamic-tests-uri-test-source) is missing support for test instances that work out their own location by walking the stack trace.\r\n\r\nThe answers to [this relevant stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58788085/how-can-i-create-a-junit-5-dynamictest-testsourceuri-from-a-stacktraceelement) fall short:\r\n * Top-rated answer, of using the `method:` scheme:\r\n   * You cannot get method arguments from a `StackTraceElement`\r\n   * Scheme does not support line number information, so you loose the distinction between multiple tests instances created in the same method\r\n   * Does not support test instances created in constructors\r\n * Accepted answer, of constructing a `file:` URI from the `StackTraceElement`, leaves you making unsafe assumptions about how the project source and build directories are organised (e.g.: maven vs gradle conventions, multi-module projects, instances defined in dependency jars, etc)\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Test source URI scheme that can be constructed from the data available in a StackTraceElement\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
