am using a single instance of `Launcher` to execute multiple requests. For each request, I want to register a separate instance of `TestExecutionListener` with the launcher so that a listener is notified of the events only for that particular request/test plan. The listener should also provide access to the `TestPlan` to which it is listening.  \r\n\r\nI am using the existing APIs in Eclipse in the following way:\r\n- Registering a single static listener with the launcher for all the requests being executed. This is not correct as we don't want to use a single static listener.\r\n- Accessing the test plan in the listener via `TestExecutionListener.testPlanExecutionStarted(TestPlan testPlan)` API. This could be a problem if test plans are being run in parallel.\r\n\r\nYou can have a look at these files for the current implementation: \r\n- [JUnit5TestReference.java](https://github.com/noopur2507/eclipse-junit5/blob/master/org.eclipse.jdt.junit5.runtime/src/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/junit5/runner/JUnit5TestReference.java)\r\n- [JUnit5TestListener.java](https://github.com/noopur2507/eclipse-junit5/blob/master/org.eclipse.jdt.junit5.runtime/src/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/junit5/runner/JUnit5TestListener.java)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am missing something or not using these APIs in the intended way.","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
