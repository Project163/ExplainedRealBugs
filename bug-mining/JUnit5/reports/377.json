So I would like to request support for a file position in `UriSelector`, `FileSelector` and `ClasspathResourceSelector`.\r\n\r\n**Deliverables**\r\n\r\nSupport for a file position when using:\r\n - URI selectors\r\n - File selectors\r\n - Classpath resource selectors\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\n\r\nCucumber executes feature files written in Gherkin. A feature file consists of multiple scenarios organized in a hierarchical structure. A project may contain multiple feature files, typically organized in some directory structure.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n|- src/main/java/com/example\r\n| |- App.java\r\n|- src/test/java/com/example\r\n| |- StepDefinitions.java\r\n|- src/test/resource/com/example/\r\n| |- single.feature\r\n| |- rule.feature\r\n| |- outline.feature\r\n```\r\n\r\nContents of `outline.feature`:\r\n```feature\r\nFeature: A feature with scenario outlines\r\n\r\n  Scenario: A scenario\r\n    Given a scenario\r\n    When it is executed\r\n    Then is only runs once\r\n\r\n  Scenario Outline: A scenario outline\r\n    Given a scenario outline\r\n    When it is executed\r\n    Then <example> is used\r\n\r\n    Examples: With some text\r\n      | example |\r\n      | A       |\r\n      | B       |\r\n\r\n    Examples: With some other text\r\n      | example |\r\n      | C       |\r\n      | D       |\r\n```\r\n\r\n`outline.feature`  contains 5 tests in a hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nA feature with scenario outlines\r\n|- A scenario\r\n|- A scenario outline\r\n| |- With some text\r\n| | |- Example #1\r\n| | |- Example #2\r\n| |- With some other text\r\n| | |- Example #1\r\n| | |- Example #2\r\n```\r\nNow suppose I would like select both tests (`Example #1`, `Example #2`) nested under the example  `With some text` on line 17.\r\n\r\nCurrently JUnit discovery selectors (`ClasspathRootSelector`, `ClasspathResourceSelector`, `PackageSelector`, `FileSelector`, `DirectorySelector`) only allow me to discover all tests in a single directory or file.\r\n\r\nThe `UniqueIdSelector` could be used to select the `With some text` container but requires reproducing the unique id which is rather complicated and quite possibly an implementation detail that should not be relied upon.\r\n\r\nCucumbers  current`TestEngine` implementation currently allows for a `line` query parameter to be added in when parsing using the `UriSelector`. For example:\r\n\r\n  - `classpath:/com/example/outline.feature?line=17`\r\n  - `file:/home/mpkorstanje/projects/cucumber/src/test/resources/com/example/outline.feature?line=17`\r\n\r\nSince this is not formalized I suspect other test engines that consume the `UriSelector` may crash on the query parameter and so I would like something safer. \r\n\r\nFor IDEs being able to use a `FileSelector` with a file position would also simplify the complexity of providing support for file based test engines. Naively allowing the user to select any line in a file and execute the discovered tests for that line would provide for a minimal implementation without knowing any details about the underlying implementation of the test engine.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning applies to `ClasspathResourceSelector`.\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"juliette-derancourt","id":28359762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzU5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28359762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt","html_url":"https://github.com/juliette-derancourt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2146/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
