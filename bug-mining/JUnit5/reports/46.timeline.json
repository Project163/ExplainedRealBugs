standalone one. The `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` files from the engine jars are not longer available, so the mechanism used to retrieve the version and artifact information reports the string found in the current project manifest, namely `junit-platform-console`.\r\n```\r\nJan 19, 2017 9:40:31 PM org.junit.platform.launcher.core.ServiceLoaderTestEngineRegistry loadTestEngines\r\nINFORMATION: Discovered TestEngines
