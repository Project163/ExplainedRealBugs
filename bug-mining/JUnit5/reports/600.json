Overview\r\n\r\nThe [User Guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-console-launcher) currently states that the `junit-platform-console-standalone` JAR contains the contents of the `junit-platform-suite`, `junit-platform-suite-api`, `junit-platform-suite-commons`, and `junit-platform-suite-engine`.\r\n\r\nHowever there is no need for it to mention the `junit-platform-suite` aggregator.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nParaphrasing the analysis provided by @marcphilipp in a team discussion...\r\n\r\nThe build task takes into account all dependencies declared on `junit-platform-console-standalone`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/151b01d8cd2d77af9992550715a833141695a55b/junit-platform-console-standalone/junit-platform-console-standalone.gradle.kts#L10-L20\r\n\r\nIf we replace `projects.junitPlatformSuite` with the individual projects, it might automatically correct itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
