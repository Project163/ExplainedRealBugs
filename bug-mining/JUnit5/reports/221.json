Overview\r\n\r\nIt’s a feature request: support converting argument strings containing integral literals in hexadecimal to the corresponding types on top of decimal.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently one cannot use hexadecimal integral values when specifying arguments, e.g., this won't work:\r\n```java\r\n@CsvSource({\r\n    \"1\",\r\n    \"0x1\", // Won't be converted\r\n}) // CSV source for illustrative purposes: ValueSource would suite here better\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\nvoid test(int v) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe cases when one needs to use hex include copying values in hex from some specification; when binary representation (i.e., which bit in the value is set) matters.\r\n\r\n### Workaround \r\nUse String as argument type and convert yourself with, e.g., Integer::decode.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ]
