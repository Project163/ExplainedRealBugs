issue will describe my problems using JUnit together with another engine: Cucumber. But hopefully the proposed solution would increase JUnit Suite usability overall)\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation. the preferred way of running Cucumber, is via the JUnit Platform Suite.\r\nI can set configuration parameters for the suite launcher discovery request, which then the underlaying engine can use, via `@ConfigurationParameter`, or `@ConfigurationParameters`.\r\nIt also defaults to parsing a `junit-platform.properties` file on classpath if found.\r\n\r\nAs long as I have set my configuration parameters as described above, the cucumber engine boots nicely, and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, when running Cucumber on the CLI, or via my IDE´s \"run\" functionality, Cucumber is not run via the the JUnit platform.\r\nThis makes configuring my tests to work with both JUnit and in standalone mode a bit tricky. Cucumber, in standalone mode, will try and look for a `cucumber.properties` file on classpath.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few options:\r\n1. Duplicate the `junit-platform.properties` file, and save it as `cucumber.properties`.\r\n  (Sad, keeping two files in sync is always a pain)\r\n3. Keep my `cucumber.properties` file, and use annotations for the JUnit Suite (`@ConfigurationParameter`)\r\n  (Same here, I will have some configuration in-code, and some in a properties file)\r\n4. Do neither, and use System properties\r\n  (I dislike it because it requires environmental setup for new developers, and may cause system-system variances)\r\n\r\nInstead, it would be super helpful if we could feed configuration parameters to the JUnit Platform Suite, from a properties file of choice. If so I could have a single properties file for both my standalone cucumber runs, and my platform suite runs.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nMy idea is to introduce a new annotation, like:\r\n```java\r\n@ConfigurationParameterFile(\"myown.properties\")\r\n```\r\n(Naming tbd..)\r\n\r\nWhich would work just like `@ConfigurationParameter`, by reading the file and setting the config parameters.\r\nAnnotating with both `@ConfigurationParameterFile` and `@ConfigurationParameter` should be allowed. Where as `@ConfigurationParameter` takes precedence for a given key-value.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] New annotation for supplying configuration parameters via properties file.\r\n- [ ] Extend `SuiteLauncherDiscoveryRequestBuilder` to parse the properties file, as specified in the new annotation\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to take a stab at implementing this via a PR.\r\nFeedback always welcome. Hope my points came across clearly, otherwise please let me know!","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
