The Gradle build you linked uses `testCompile` twice, and `testRuntime` once. It's a short-coming of Maven not to distinguish between those two scopes and also a lack of \"magic\" in Surefire's JUnit Platform Provider that it doesn't auto-resolve the matching engine for the used API. This [junit-platform-maven-plugin](https://github.com/sormuras/junit-platform-maven-plugin) does the trick.\r\n\r\n`junit-jupiter-engine` has a transitive dependency on `junit-jupiter-api`.

That's why a regular user should only depend on `junit-jupiter-api`. A single dependency delivering a bunch of features.

The Gradle build you linked uses testCompile twice, and testRuntime once.\r\n\r\nI did notice that, but I wondered if the distinction made much difference to most users. Is the additional dependency worth it?\r\n\r\n> Surefire's JUnit Platform Provider that it doesn't auto-resolve the matching engine for the used API. This junit-platform-maven-plugin does the trick.\r\n\r\nIs the `junit-platform-maven-plugin` the recommended way to configure Maven? The reference documentation doesn't mention it, so I'd not seen it before. Or is this something that's ultimately going to be part of the `maven-surefire-plugin`?\r\n\r\nI'm asking because at some point we're planning to [upgrade Spring Boot's testing support](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/14736) to use JUnit 5 and I'd like to make sure we use the recommended configuration.\r\n\r\n> junit-jupiter-engine has a transitive dependency on junit-jupiter-api. Thus, if you only want to save some lines of XML, leave out junit-jupiter-api here\r\n\r\nThanks, that makes things clearer. So depending on `junit-jupiter-engine` makes the build file smaller, but the user might accidentally import a class that they shouldn't. Using the `junit-jupiter-api` is technically better, but somewhat academic for Maven and Eclipse users since those project don't offer the classpath isolation needed to prevent accidental imports anyway. Using the `junit-platform-maven-plugin` means no direct `junit-jupiter-engine` dependency is needed at all, and it's figured out when the tests run?\r\n\r\n> junit-jupiter-params is an optional and still experimental API. Let the test author be in control what is needed to write tests.\r\n\r\nUnderstood, perhaps at some point it will get promoted into the core module. Until then, two dependencies makes sense.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think some additional documentation or links early in the reference guide might really help with the getting started experience. A couple of \"quick start\" examples for Maven and Gradle in the installation section would probably help 90% of your users get going quickly. I didn't find the \"Running Tests\" section until a bit later so I was mainly going on the samples as my guide for how to configure the build system.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/428241637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philwebb","id":519772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb","html_url":"https://github.com/philwebb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/428243109","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1629#issuecomment-428243109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1629","id":428243109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODI0MzEwOQ==","user":{"login":"philwebb","id":519772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/519772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb","html_url":"https://github.com/philwebb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philwebb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-09T15:41:39Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T15:41:39Z","body":"In hindsight it feels like a single dependency isn't worth it.
