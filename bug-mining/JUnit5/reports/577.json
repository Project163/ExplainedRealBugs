Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Find one of the affected (see 'Remark' below) source artifacts on maven central: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/jupiter/junit-jupiter-engine/5.10.0/junit-jupiter-engine-5.10.0-sources.jar\r\n2. Observe that the source jar contains a top level `main` folder that shouldn't be there: ![image](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/assets/301092/817c54d4-dbc5-4712-ad1b-6513f1125086)\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.10.0\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: N/A\r\n\r\n## Remark\r\n\r\nNot *all* source `jars` are wrong. I've tried to fix it myself and issue a PR, but I don't understand exactly where it's going wrong. \r\n\r\nTo the best of my skills I think I can narrow it down to everywhere where the plugin `id(\"junitbuild.kotlin-library-conventions\")` is used rather than `id(\"junitbuild.java-library-conventions\")`.\r\n\r\nI tried to narrow it down with:\r\n\r\n1. Do a `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`\r\n2. Create small bash script that will output if `main/` directory has been found in the given `jar` file:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    ❯ cat a.sh\r\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n    \r\n    zipinfo -1 \"$1\" main/ 2>&1 | awk '{ print \"'\"$1\"': \" $0 }'\r\n    ```\r\n3. Run a find on the local repository, excluding the ones where a warning was printed that `main` was *not* found:\r\n    ```shell\r\n    $ ~/.m2/repository/org/junit\r\n    ❯ find . -name '*SNAPSHOT-sources.jar' -exec ./a.sh {} \\; | grep -v \"filename not matched:  main\"\r\n    ./jupiter/junit-jupiter-api/5.11.0-SNAPSHOT/junit-jupiter-api-5.11.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar: main/\r\n    ./jupiter/junit-jupiter-params/5.11.0-SNAPSHOT/junit-jupiter-params-5.11.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar: main/\r\n    ./jupiter/junit-jupiter-engine/5.11.0-SNAPSHOT/junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar: main/\r\n    ```","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3474/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
