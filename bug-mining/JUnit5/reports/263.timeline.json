Overview\r\n\r\nA more complete port of the Travis configuration.  I talked with @brunoborges about porting more of the CI invocation over to Azure Pipelines; this picks up from his #1796 with a few differences:\r\n\r\n1. For the Java 11 (Linux), macOS and Windows-based builds, this runs directly on the Azure Pipelines build agents, since they have Java 11 installed.\r\n2. For the Java 12 and Java 13 based builds, this runs within the OpenJDK docker images.  The Azure Pipelines build agents do not have a Java 12 or 13 runtime installed, so the preferred mechanism is to [run within a docker image](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/cross-platform-container-builds-with-azure-pipelines/).\r\n3. Just run gradle on the command line instead of trying to run the gradle task.  This allows us to use the same script configuration and template for both the container-based builds and the on-agent builds.\r\n4. Only one of the builds (I chose the Java 12 Linux build) publishes test results, per @sormuras's request in #1796.\r\n\r\nOutstanding Issues:\r\n\r\n1. The publish steps do _not_ succeed.  (Thankfully.)  They require authentication which obviously I did not configure, as I do not have that information.  I'm happy to help configure secret variables so that we can move that forward.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how else I can help!  😀 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit

those two publish/update jobs (and the coverage job as well) are good candidates for a dedicated \"Release Pipeline\", aren't they?\r\n\r\n@sormuras - I actually would not in this case.  There's a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Pipelines are really useful when you have additional levels of complexity.  For example: if you want to deploy to a staging server, then QA, then production, pipelines help manage that.  They're still useful for a single deployment like this but you're not taking advantage of a lot of the complex parts.\r\n\r\n2. It also adds a complication, related to the first point: since pipelines are created for a way to arbitrarily deploy artifacts, you need to _build_ an artifact.  So you'll probably run `./gradlew --scan publish -x check` then zip up the artifacts and publish them.  Then your release pipeline will take that zip and do the publish.  So it's slower and has another moving piece.\r\n\r\n3. Release pipelines can't be defined as YAML (yet).\r\n\r\nSo, to be honest, I would keep this as-is for now, it's simpler and gets the job done.  If you want to scale things up or increase the complexity then it makes sense to reconsider.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/472116295/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ethomson","id":1130014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1130014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson","html_url":"https://github.com/ethomson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethomson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2198022926,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE5ODAyMjkyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2198022926","actor":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-12T18:04:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
