This new configuration will then be used in ForkJoinPoolHierarchicalTestExecutorService.\r\n\r\nAs I've stated before, I can make a PR with  a solution we'll agree

[JUnit Jupiter does not guarantee that the number of concurrently executing tests will not exceed the configured parallelism](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution-config). The advice is to provide a custom [`ParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.platform.engine/org/junit/platform/engine/support/hierarchical/ParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy.html). And through https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/2792 it is now possible to configure whether or not the pool should be saturated.\r\n\r\nHowever implementing a custom strategy to replicate the behaviour of the existing `fixed` or `dynamic` strategy with saturation is non-trivial. On the other hand, ensuring a maximum number of concurrent tests is a common need e.g: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2545, https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1675, https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1858, https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/10113, https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/2512, https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/2602.\r\n\r\nWe can stream line the experience for end-users by providing `*.dynamic.saturate` and `*.fixed.saturate` properties. When set to `true` the `DefaultParallelExecutionConfiguration.getSaturatePredicate` would return `__ -> true` and `null` otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Update `DefaultParallelExecutionConfigurationStrategy` to read `*.dynamic.saturate` and `*.fixed.saturate` properties.\r\n- [x] Update the documentation to explain this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3026/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3026/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mpkorstanje","id":6946919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6946919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje","html_url":"https://github.com/mpkorstanje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-09T16:06:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T16:06:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3027","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3027/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3027/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3027/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/pull/3027","id":1366103225,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAbwRH84-llTo","number":3027,"title":"Support

Overview\r\n\r\nWith Java 9+ the `ForkJoinPool` used by JUnit can be configured with a maximum pool size via the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.max-pool-size` property.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of concurrently executing tests may exceed the configured parallelism when tests become blocked, it will not exceed the maximum pool size in these circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```properties\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=concurrent\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example will report between 2-5 tests running concurrently.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ExampleTest {\r\n\r\n    private static final AtomicInteger running = new AtomicInteger();\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void increment() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Running \" + running.incrementAndGet());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterEach\r\n    void decrement() {\r\n        running.decrementAndGet();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static IntStream numbers() {\r\n        return IntStream.range(0, 1000);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @ParameterizedTest\r\n    @MethodSource(\"numbers\")\r\n    void test(int i) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {\r\n        Runnable sleep = () -> {\r\n            try {\r\n                Thread.sleep(600);\r\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        ForkJoinPool.commonPool().submit(sleep).get();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy also configuring the `max-pool-size` we can ensure the concurrently executing test does not exceed the configured 2.\r\n\r\n```properties\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.max-pool-size=2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because the `ForkJoinPool` will by default reject tasks that would exceed the maximum pool size the\r\n`junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.saturate` property has been added and will default to `true`. There appears to be no reason to ever set this `false` but it is there should someone depend on the old behavior.\r\n\r\nThese changes were intentionally not made to the `dynamic` strategy to limit the scope of this pull request. While I can reasonably predict what behaviour users of the `fixed` strategy might expect, I can not say the same about the `dynamic` strategy.\r\n\r\nFixes: #2545\r\nFixes: #1858\r\nFixes: #3026\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces #3027.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License
