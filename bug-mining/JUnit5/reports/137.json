display name for test using parameters from `@CsvSource` could be improved. Currently the following test:\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n    @ParameterizedTest\r\n    @CsvSource({\"value1,value2\"})\r\n    void test(String string) {\r\n        // \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill produce test name:\r\n```\r\n[1] value1, value2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that generated test name contains all columns from record provided by `@CsvSource`. In above example the record `\"value1,value2\"` is converted to 2 columns: `\"value1\"` and `\"value2\"`. It would be better to include only actually used columns, so in this case: `\"value1\"`.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1081/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
