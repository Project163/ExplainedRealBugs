stated in #2819, it would be useful to make a build fail when engine filters are not well configured.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Fail test discovery if an `IncludeEngines` filter is configured and doesn't match any engine.\r\n- [x] Log a warning if all engines have been filtered out by an exclude filter.\r\n- [x] ~Log a warning (instead of config) in case no engine is on the classpath (in `ServiceLoaderTestEngineRegistry`).~ `SuiteLauncher` and `DefaultLauncher` already throw an exception in that case\r\n\r\nIssue opened following decision taken in
