Overview\r\n\r\nThis a follow up to #2647 that aims to make the new `org.junit.platform.commons.util.AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(Class<?>, Class<A>, boolean)` feature available to `TestEngine` and extension authors.\r\n\r\nSee also [this thread](https://twitter.com/knutwannheden/status/1404685536527327233) on Twitter.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Considerations\r\n\r\nThe new method in `AnnotationSupport` does not necessarily have to have the same name or signature as the internal method in `AnnotationUtils`. We may choose a different method name in order to avoid the simplistic `boolean` flag to enable the feature, since setting the flag to `false` makes the method behave the same as the existing `findAnnotation()` methods. Alternatively, we may wish to introduce an enum instead of a boolean flag in order to be able to support additional semantics in the future.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Design the new API.\r\n- [x] Implement the new API.\r\n- [x] Document it in release notes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2649/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
