consistency with `ClassTemplateInvocationContextProvider` and to\nmake implementations simpler, this commit changes the return type of the\n`provideTestTemplateInvocationContexts(ExtensionContext)` method of the\n`TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider` interface to allow more concrete\n`Streams` to be returned.\n\nThis change is source compatible, meaning implementations will still\ncompile when declaring `Stream<TestTemplateInvocationContext>` as method\nreturn type. To check for binary compatibility, I used Pioneer's\n`RetryingTestExtension` with a 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT that included this change.\nThe extension kept working. Nevertheless, I included this change as\npotentially breaking in the release notes.\n\nResolves #3577.\n\n<!-- Please describe your changes here and list any open questions you might have.
