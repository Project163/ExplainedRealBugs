Context\r\n\r\nWe're going to provide JUnit 5 support.\r\n\r\n### What's new test framework's name?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's named as `useJUnitPlatform()` in contrast to exsited `useJUnit()`/`useTestNG()`, but that's not decided yet, see [discussion here](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/3886/files#r160560929).\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nAs a first step, we want to provide equivalent support as current test features for the following basic JUnit 5 features:\r\n\r\n- Allow user to specify `useJUnitPlatform()` and run pure JUnit 5 tests.\r\n- All our test features (e.g. `includePattern`/`excludePattern`) should work for JUnit 5 basic tests:\r\n  - [Standard Tests](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-standard)\r\n  - [Assertions](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-assertions)\r\n  - [Assumptions](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-assumptions)\r\n  - [Disabling Tests](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-disabling)\r\n\r\n### Existed Gradle test infrastructure\r\n\r\nPreviously, we have two [TestFramework](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/c532913159d4098e8d48f9ddce494beb9cec37f4/subprojects/testing-jvm/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/TestFramework.java) implementations: [JUnitTestFramework](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/2f94bfed05d248447439febefb45e841b7d73793/subprojects/testing-jvm/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/junit/JUnitTestFramework.java) and [TestNGTestFramework](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/2f94bfed05d248447439febefb45e841b7d73793/subprojects/testing-jvm/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/testng/TestNGTestFramework.java). The most important responsibility of theirs is to provide [TestClassProcessor](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/f24146cc5f956a1b03a515bbee4225e6f861b6ab/subprojects/testing-base/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/TestClassProcessor.java) for test worker JVM process, and `TestClassProcessor` is the main entry of Gradle test message dispatch layer. For example, [JUnitTestClassProcessor](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/33a00cae60e114ff53cb3e9cf1eeeb8356b996f4/subprojects/testing-jvm/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/junit/JUnitTestClassProcessor.java) is an concrete implementation which registers a JUnit `RunListener` to JUnit 3/4 engine, receives notification, converts and dispatches these notifications to Gradle test infrastructure. \r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 Test progress/report\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n            Gradle test message dispatch/collection\r\n-------------↑--------------  --------------↑--------------\r\n  JUnitTestClassProcessor      TestNGTestClassProcessor\r\n     JUnit 3/4 Engine                 TestNG Engine\r\n```\r\n\r\n### First-step implementation\r\n\r\nThe simplest approach is to create an adapter layer and plug it into the current infrastructure. This PR slightly refactors [JUnitTestEventAdapter](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/33a00cae60e114ff53cb3e9cf1eeeb8356b996f4/subprojects/testing-jvm/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/junit/JUnitTestEventAdapter.java) and extends it as [JUnitPlatformTestExecutionListener](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/33a00cae60e114ff53cb3e9cf1eeeb8356b996f4/subprojects/testing-junit-platform/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/junitplatform/JUnitPlatformTestExecutionListener.java). `JUnitPlatformTestExecutionListener.java` implements [JUnit5 TestExecutionListener](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/platform/launcher/TestExecutionListener.html) and adapts the received message to Gradle test infrastructure. Likewise, [JUnitPlatformTestClassProcessor](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/33a00cae60e114ff53cb3e9cf1eeeb8356b996f4/subprojects/testing-junit-platform/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/junitplatform/JUnitPlatformTestClassProcessor.java) extends [JUnitTestClassProcessor](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/33a00cae60e114ff53cb3e9cf1eeeb8356b996f4/subprojects/testing-jvm/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/junit/JUnitTestClassProcessor.java) to avoid lots of rework.\r\n\r\n```\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                      Test progress/report\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                    Gradle test message dispatch/collection\r\n---------------↑-------------------  --------------↑--------------\r\n  JUnitTestClassProcessor               TestNGTestClassProcessor\r\n  JUnit 3/4 Engine   ↑                  TestNG Engine\r\n---------------------↑-----------\r\n  JUnitPlatformTestClassProcessor\r\n  JUnit 5 Engine\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Java 8 subprojects\r\n\r\nAll JUnit 5 jar are Java 8 format. This PR creates a new subprojects and set its `sourceCompatibility` to `1.8`. We have to instantiate `JUnitPlatformTestClassProcessor` via reflection: https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/33a00cae60e114ff53cb3e9cf1eeeb8356b996f4/subprojects/testing-jvm/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/junitplatform/JUnitPlatformTestFramework.java#L80 because its class format is also Java 8, which can't be used by other subprojects at compile time.\r\n\r\n### Test integration of Gradle&JUnit 5\r\n\r\nTo avoid rewriting hundreds of JUnit 5 test cases, this PR can convert existed JUnit 4 test cases to JUnit 5 test cases:\r\n\r\n- `org.junit.Test` -> org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\r\n- `org.junit.Before` -> `org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach`\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nAnd then run tests with `JUnitBasicMultiVersionIntegrationSpec`.\r\n\r\nAll basic JUnit 4 tests (without `Runner`/`Categories`) in `testing-jvm` subprojects have been annotated and tested.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gradle/gradle/issues/4116/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gradle/gradle/issues/4116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1697183902,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2OTcxODM5MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1697183902","actor":{"login":"Andrei94","id":8221614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjE2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8221614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94","html_url":"https://github.com/Andrei94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Andrei94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"23a2b26b4598e9399cf8033597d8b8d049e880a3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Andrei94/junit5/commits/23a2b26b4598e9399cf8033597d8b8d049e880a3","created_at":"2018-06-23T10:13:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
