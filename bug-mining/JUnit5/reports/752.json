Overview\n\nWhile upgrading the Spring Framework test suite to use JUnit 5.13, I noticed a discovery issue warning that `@Order` annotations were declared on test methods within a `@Nested` test class without proper configuration of the `OrderAnnotation` `MethodOrderer`.\n\nHowever, the enclosing class was annotated with `@TestMethodOrder(OrderAnnotation.class)`.\n\nThus, it became apparent that `@TestMethodOrder` is currently not _inherited_ for `@Nested` test classes.\n\nFor Spring, I simply [redeclared](https://github.com/sbrannen/spring-framework/commit/de7d50d39f2559286e5906ff8821c25e00494867) `@TestMethodOrder` on the `@Nested` test class, and the warning went away.\n\n## Proposal\n\nIt would be very useful if `@Nested` test classes _inherited_ a `@TestMethodOrder` configured on an enclosing class.\n\nHowever, there would then be no way to \"turn off\" the inherited `MethodOrderer`. To address that, I propose that we also introduce a new, no-op `Default` `MethodOrderer` which effectively signals that the \"default\" `MethodOrderer` should be used.\n\n`@TestClassOrder` should also be inherited by default within `@Nested` test class hierarchies, and a `Default` implementation of `ClassOrderer` will also be necessary.\n\n`MethodOrderingVisitor.orderContainedMethods()` and `ClassOrderingVisitor.createClassLevelOrderer()` will need to be updated accordingly to take into account `Default` orderers.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Inherit `@TestMethodOrder` to nested test classes\n- [x] Inherit `@TestClassOrder` to nested test classes\n- [x] Introduce `MethodOrderer.Default` that can be used to opt-out and use the default orderer specified via the `junit.jupiter.testmethod.order.default` configuration parameter (or none if the configuration parameter is not set)\n- [x] Introduce `ClassOrderer.Default` that can be used to opt-out and use the default orderer specified via the `junit.jupiter.testclass.order.default` configuration parameter (or none if the configuration parameter is not set)","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4731/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
