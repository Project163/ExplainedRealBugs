Overview\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a way to write an extension that changes the behavior of test execution.\r\n\r\nExamples of what I would like to do are:\r\n\r\n- let each test run 100x in 5 threads to check for race conditions\r\n- let a test execute in the Swing EDT Thread.\r\n\r\nSuch use cases were easy to implement with JUnit 4 Rules, and I used especially the second a lot. So I think it would be bad to lose this option in JUnit Jupiter.\r\n\r\n## Proposals\r\n\r\n- see https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/157#issuecomment-190187989\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- supersedes #20 \r\n- related to #201\r\n- related to #1248 \r\n- duplicated by #1442 ","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/157/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
