looking into https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui/issues/2423, where we have a mixture of JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 tests, as well as nested test suites. All test suites are defined with JUnit 5 annotations, but most tests are JUnit 4 tests.\n\nI've arrived at this with a debugger:\n\n<img width=\"1919\" height=\"985\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6a9e71c-affe-4151-b37f-33c4bc0f60e3\" />\n\nWhile trying to understand why the two maps have a different order of engines, I noticed `org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherDiscoveryResult.retainEngines(Predicate<? super TestDescriptor>)`:\n\n```java\n\tprivate Map<TestEngine, EngineResultInfo> retainEngines(Predicate<? super TestDescriptor> predicate) {\n\t\t// @formatter:off\n\t\treturn this.testEngineResults.entrySet()\n\t\t\t\t.stream()\n\t\t\t\t.filter(entry -> predicate.test(entry.getValue().getRootDescriptor()))\n\t\t\t\t.collect(toMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue));\n\t\t// @formatter:on\n\t}\n```\n\nIf I check the implementation of `java.util.stream.Collectors.toMap(Function<? super T, ? extends K>, Function<? super T, ? extends U>)` in JDK 17 resp. JDK 21, it creates a `HashMap`:\n\n```java\n    public static <T, K, U>\n    Collector<T, ?, Map<K,U>> toMap(Function<? super T, ? extends K> keyMapper,\n                                    Function<? super T, ? extends U> valueMapper) {\n        return new CollectorImpl<>(HashMap::new,\n                                   uniqKeysMapAccumulator(keyMapper, valueMapper),\n                                   uniqKeysMapMerger(),\n                                   CH_ID);\n    }\n```\n\nThe documentation itself states the type of the map cannot be relied on:\n\n```\n     * <p>There are no guarantees on the type, mutability, serializability,\n     * or thread-safety of the {@code Map} returned.\n```\n\nThis new `HashMap` is then packed into a `org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherDiscoveryResult` object, see `org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherDiscoveryResult.withRetainedEngines(Predicate<? super TestDescriptor>)`:\n\n```java\n\tpublic LauncherDiscoveryResult withRetainedEngines(Predicate<? super TestDescriptor> predicate) {\n\t\tMap<TestEngine, EngineResultInfo> prunedTestEngineResults = retainEngines(predicate);\n\t\tif (prunedTestEngineResults.size() < this.testEngineResults.size()) {\n\t\t\treturn new LauncherDiscoveryResult(prunedTestEngineResults, this.configurationParameters,\n\t\t\t\tthis.outputDirectoryProvider);\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n```\n\nAnd in the respective constructor, its wrapped in a `LinkedHashMap`:\n\n```java\n\tLauncherDiscoveryResult(Map<TestEngine, EngineResultInfo> testEngineResults,\n\t\t\tConfigurationParameters configurationParameters, OutputDirectoryProvider outputDirectoryProvider) {\n\t\tthis.testEngineResults = unmodifiableMap(new LinkedHashMap<>(testEngineResults));\n\t\tthis.configurationParameters = configurationParameters;\n\t\tthis.outputDirectoryProvider = outputDirectoryProvider;\n\t}\n```\n\nI assume the iteration order is important... it has to be, later on the engine order is used to run tests. I assume different engine order results in a different test order later on.","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
