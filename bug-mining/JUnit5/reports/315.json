Overview\r\n\r\nWhile migrating the Spring Framework test suite from JUnit 4 and Hamcrest to JUnit Jupiter and AssertJ, entire projects in Spring's test suite started reporting zero tests after removing the dependency on Hamcrest even though the tests no longer used Hamcrest. Adding Hamcrest back as a test runtime dependency allowed the tests to execute again.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nThanks to some investigative work by @marcphilipp, we came to the following conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe `JupiterTestEngine` fails with a `NoClassDefFoundError` if JUnit 4 is on the classpath but Hamcrest is not. The underlying reason is that `OpenTest4JAndJUnit4AwareThrowableCollector` has a `static` initialization block that checks if the `org.junit.internal.AssumptionViolatedException` class can be loaded. However, since `AssumptionViolatedException` has a direct dependency on `org.hamcrest.Matcher`, a `NoClassDefFoundError` is thrown when attempting to load `AssumptionViolatedException`.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor `OpenTest4JAndJUnit4AwareThrowableCollector` so that a failed attempt to detect the presence of `AssumptionViolatedException` in the classpath does not crash the entire `JupiterTestEngine`.\r\n- [x] Document in the Release Notes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
