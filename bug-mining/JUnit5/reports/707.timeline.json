and [JUnit Pioneer PR](https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/pull/662). Why do I note this here? Because some of the builder methods validates the input against a valid pattern - which the old constructor did not. So you might have the same discussion as we if you see this as a breaking change or
