the development, I found out that emptyValue in settings another meaning had to the issue I wanted to address.\r\n\r\nIn CsvParserSettings emptyValue means:\r\n\r\n> When reading, if the parser does not read any character from the input, and the input is within quotes, the empty is used instead of an empty string\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    void

If yes, I implemented in the following pull request the previous feature description: #1839 \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think emptyValue is not the best name for it.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant in this issue was a value definition:\r\n\"When reading, if the parser reads a value with this string, null is returned\"\r\n\r\nI think this parameter name could be nullValue.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n`1;;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25` -> Second Value(not present) is null\r\n\r\nIn this issue, I wanted to address the possibility to set an alternative to \"not present/null\" values\r\n\r\n`1;null;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25` here, if nullValue is set to \"null\", second value after parsing would be null\r\n`1;vacio;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25` here, if nullValue is set to \"vacio\", second value after parsing would be null\r\n`1;nill;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25` here, if nullValue is set to \"nill\", second value after parsing would be null\r\n\r\nThen a test would look like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    void emptyValueIsAnEmptyWithCustomNullValueString() {\r\n        Stream<Object[]> arguments = provideArguments(',', \"\",\"empty\", \"vacio , , empty , ''\");\r\n\r\n

Description\r\n\r\nThe idea is when parsing the values, null will be also returned if the value is equals to the string.\r\n\r\nI think this parameter name could be nullValue.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n1;;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25 -> Second Value(not present) is null\r\n\r\nIn this issue, I would like to address the possibility to set an alternative to \"not present/null\" values\r\n\r\n1;null;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25 here, if nullValue is set to \"null\", second value after parsing would be null\r\n1;vacio;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25 here, if nullValue is set to \"vacio\", second value after parsing would be null\r\n1;nill;20.7;6.75;9; 6.25 here, if nullValue is set to \"nill\", second value after parsing would be null\r\n\r\nThen a test would look like this:\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    void emptyValueIsAnEmptyWithCustomNullValueString() {\r\n        Stream<Object[]> arguments = provideArguments(',', \"\",\"empty\", \"vacio , , empty , ''\");\r\n\r\n        assertThat(arguments).containsExactly(new String[] { \"vacio\", null, null, \"\" });\r\n    }\r\n    private Stream<Object[]> provideArguments(char delimiter, String emptyValue, String nullValue, String... value) {\r\n        CsvSource annotation = mock(CsvSource.class);\r\n        when(annotation.value()).thenReturn(value);\r\n        when(annotation.delimiter()).thenReturn(delimiter);\r\n        when(annotation.emptyValue()).thenReturn(emptyValue);\r\n        when(annotation.nullValue()).thenReturn(nullValue);\r\n\r\n        CsvArgumentsProvider provider = new CsvArgumentsProvider();\r\n        provider.accept(annotation);\r\n        return provider.provideArguments(null).map(Arguments::get);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt could be used like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@CsvSource(value = {\"null,null,null,null\", \"null,2,null,null\", \"1,null,null,null\", \"20,110,true,110\", \"20,110,false,20\"}, nullValue = \"null\")\r\n```\r\nParsed to:\r\n```java\r\nnull null null null \r\nnull 2 null null\r\n1 null null null\r\n20 110 true 110\r\n20 110 false 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the same meaning to:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@CsvSource({\",,,\", \",2,,\", \"1,,,\", \"20,110,true,110\", \"20,110,false,20\"})\r\n```\r\nParsed to:\r\n```java\r\nnull null null null \r\nnull 2 null null\r\n1 null null null\r\n20 110 true 110\r\n20 110 false 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case of having a custom nullValue configured. I think, in case of finding no value, should be returned null too.\r\n```java\r\n@CsvSource(value = {\",,,\", \"null,2,null,null\", \"1,null,null,null\", \"20,110,true,110\", \"20,110,false,20\"}, nullValue = \"null\")\r\n```\r\nParsed to:\r\n```java\r\nnull null null null \r\nnull 2 null null\r\n1 null null null\r\n20 110 true 110\r\n20 110 false 20\r\n```\r\n## Related issue\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1788\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2266687583,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI2NjY4NzU4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2266687583","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-10T16:33:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2266687893,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNjY2ODc4OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2266687893","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ac0f6dc379c30a3c821dfbffc73f95732734b6b1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/commits/ac0f6dc379c30a3c821dfbffc73f95732734b6b1","created_at":"2019-04-10T16:34:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
