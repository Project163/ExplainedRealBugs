Bug description\r\n```\r\nString idString = uniqueIdFromMethodDescriptorWithArrayParameter.toString();\r\nUniqueId id = UniqueId.parse(idString);\r\n```\r\nwill fail with `PreconditionViolation` since array types are described with an `[` in front but `[` chars are currently forbidden as segment values.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nChange representation of array types in `ReflectionUtils.findMethod(clazz, methodName, parameterTypeNames)` and `StringUtils.nullSafeToString(classes)`. \r\n\r\nAlternative: Don't use `[` as separator char in unique IDs. But some 3rd party tools might already have committed to the current format.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Encode `segmentType` and `value` in constructor and decode in `parse`.","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
