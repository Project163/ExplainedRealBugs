I'm working on a test engine that delegates work to other test engines.\r\n\r\nEverything works great, except I have to use `ExecutionRequest`'s constructor which is marked as internal.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/80bf93fd3cb841e76fc017dc759d8ef0df158d49/junit-platform-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/engine/ExecutionRequest.java#L39-L41\r\n\r\nSo please add a _public_ way to instantiate `ExecutionRequest` or replace it with an interface like `EngineDiscoveryRequest`.\r\n\r\nThis will make variations of suite engine possible.\r\n\r\nThe other possibility is to directly test the `TestEngine#execute` method without using an internal API.","closed_by":{"login":"juliette-derancourt","id":28359762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzU5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28359762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt","html_url":"https://github.com/juliette-derancourt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
