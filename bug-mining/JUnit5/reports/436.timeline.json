point of that TestNG issue was that people misuse the assertion methods to check their `equals` implementations ([example for such misuse](https://lgtm.com/query/6157623132776546027/)). Personally I think it would therefore be better to explicitly state that this is not what the assertion methods are intended for; only documenting their implementation might not necessarily prevent people from misusing them, especially when the implications of the implementation are not obvious.\r\n\r\nI think it would therefore be better to add something similar to the following to the `Assertions` class documentation instead of describing the implementation details of the assertion methods:\r\n> **Important:** Assertion methods comparing two values for equality, such as `assertEquals`, are *only* intended to test equality for an (un-)expected and an actual result value. They are not designed for testing whether a class correctly implements `equals(Object)`. For example `assertEquals` might return fast when provided with the same object as expected and actual value without calling `equals(Object)` at all.  \r\nSuch tests trying to verify the `equals(Object)` implementation should instead be written explicitly and `assertTrue` or `assertFalse` should be used to verify the result, e.g.: `assertTrue(var.equals(var))`, `assertFalse(var.equals(null))`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
