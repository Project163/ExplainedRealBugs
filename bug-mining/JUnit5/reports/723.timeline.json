Overview\n\nIn the Spring Framework test suite, [`EnableJmsTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-jms/src/test/java/org/springframework/jms/annotation/EnableJmsTests.java) and [`AnnotationDrivenNamespaceTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-jms/src/test/java/org/springframework/jms/annotation/AnnotationDrivenNamespaceTests.java) extend [`AbstractJmsAnnotationDrivenTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-jms/src/test/java/org/springframework/jms/annotation/AbstractJmsAnnotationDrivenTests.java) which declares `abstract` `@Test` methods.\n\nThe `@Test` annotations are used as a form of documentation to signal that concrete implementations of those test methods must be annotated with `@Test`.\n\nRunning `EnableJmsTests` and `AnnotationDrivenNamespaceTests` by themselves does not result in any discovery issue warnings.\n\nHowever, when running the test suite, `AbstractJmsAnnotationDrivenTests` also gets analyzed and results in the following invalid warnings.\n\n```\nWARNING: TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' encountered 9 non-critical issues during test
