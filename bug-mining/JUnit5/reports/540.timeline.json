This ID allows individual tests to be uniquely selected - for example for rerunning a failed test. So under no circumstances should any two distinct tests have the same unique ID.\r\n\r\n It is up to the Scala Test Engine to construct the tree in such a way that all tests have a unique ID regardless of how a user might structure their tests. As such this error suggests a problem in the implementation of the Scala Test Engine and doesn't have to be actionable by a user.\r\n\r\nLooking at https://github.com/helmethair-co/scalatest-junit-runner/blob/main/src/main/java/co/helmethair/scalatest/descriptor/ScalatestDescriptor.java\r\n```java\r\n    static UniqueId testId(String suiteId, String testName) {\r\n        return ENGINE_ID.append(SUITE_TYPE, suiteId).append(\"test\", testName);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would suggest the flowing changes:\r\n\r\n1. Do not append to the `ENGINE_ID` but use the `UniqueId` provided with the `TestEngine.discover` method as the root. Test engines may be used by the JUnit Platform Suite Engine and may not be the root engine in their own discovery request.\r\n\r\n2. Ensure that when a sequence of tests is used, this sequence is part of the `UniqueId`. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass DummySpec extends AnyFunSpec {\r\n\r\n  case class Child() extends AnyFunSpec {\r\n    it(\"test 1\") {}\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  object C1 extends Child()\r\n  object C2 extends Child()\r\n\r\n  override val nestedSuites: immutable.IndexedSeq[Suite] = {\r\n\r\n    immutable.IndexedSeq(C1, C2)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo here I would expect the following identifiers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nengine:scala-test\r\nengine:scala-test / suite:DummySpec\r\nengine:scala-test / suite:DummySpec / nestedSuite:0 / test:test 1\r\nengine:scala-test / suite:DummySpec / nestedSuite:1 / test:test 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: I would also suggest using the `DummySpec`s FQN instead but I left that out for brevity.\r\n\r\n3. Take care around user input:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass DummySpec extends AnyFunSpec {\r\n  it(\"test 1\") {}\r\n  it(\"test 1\") {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nInstead of using \"test 1\" as the identfier for both tests consider either referencing these tests by the order of their declaration (or finding another way to make them unique).\r\n\r\nNote that while the ID must be unique, there is no such constraint on the name that will be shown to users. Additionally tests can be filtered by their name independently from their ID. So repeatedly naming tests \"test 1\" is perfectly fine as long as their IDs are unique.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1268103535/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mpkorstanje","id":6946919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6946919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje","html_url":"https://github.com/mpkorstanje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1268140110","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3051#issuecomment-1268140110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3051","id":1268140110,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH85LlkhO","user":{"login":"mpkorstanje","id":6946919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6946919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje","html_url":"https://github.com/mpkorstanje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-05T08:49:21Z","updated_at":"2022-10-05T08:55:54Z","body":"That
