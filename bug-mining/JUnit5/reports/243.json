limits stacktraces to 10 lines (followed by [...]). However, not all exceptions have their 'root' cause at the top. One example is an exception raised in a static initializer. It gets wrapped with an 'empty' `ExceptionInInitializerError`, making the first 10 lines not helpful. \r\n\r\nAFAIK, there is no workaround available to print the full stacktrace using `ConsoleLauncher`. The only workaround is using another tool (IDE/mvn) to run the tests.\r\n\r\nExample of 'unhelpful' stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  JUnit Jupiter:DataPolicyTest\r\n    ClassSource [className = 'DataPolicyTest', filePosition = null]\r\n    => java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\r\n       ImpactAccess.<clinit>(ImpactAccess.java:21)\r\n       DataPolicyTest.<clinit>(DataPolicyTest.java:20)\r\n       sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n       sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n       sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n       java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n       org.junit.platform.commons.util.ReflectionUtils.invokeMethod(ReflectionUtils.java:532)\r\n       org.junit.jupiter.engine.execution.ExecutableInvoker.invoke(ExecutableInvoker.java:115)\r\n      org.junit.jupiter.engine.descriptor.ClassTestDescriptor.lambda$invokeBeforeAllMethods$8(ClassTestDescriptor.java:373)\r\n       org.junit.platform.engine.support.hierarchical.ThrowableCollector.execute(ThrowableCollector.java:72)\r\n       [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nMake sure an exception is raised in a static initializer of a test class.
