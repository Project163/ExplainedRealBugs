Overview\r\n\r\n**Feature request.** \r\n\r\nConsole tasks are flagged with various statuses, such as `SUCCESSFUL` and `FAILED`.  These are mapped (as of #930, as `final` constants) to `GREEN` and `RED`.\r\nThese may seem like reasonable choices, until you encounter people who are red-green colour blind, or completely colour blind, who may be unable to distinguish between success and failure cases at a glance, unlike the fully sighted.\r\nWorse, they may find it hard to read the text as high-contract text (green-on-black) is for them low-contrast dark-grey-on-black.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\nJUnit5 should allow the user to customize the `Color.ansiString` that is associated with the various status values.  At a minimum, this should allow customize the status colour, but could include:\r\n- [ ] a ANSI text attribute, such as `underline`, `bold` or `italic`.\r\n- [ ] reverse video\r\n- [ ] (forgive me) blink\r\n\r\nThis applies only to console output.\r\nAn IDE will apply its own colour/style to the various test statuses.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/985/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
