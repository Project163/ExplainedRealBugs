Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\n\r\nWhen a junit 4 test class, running under the junit 5 vintage engine, is annotated with org.junit.experimental.runners.Enclosed, and contains multiple nested classes, each using JunitParams, then gradle fails with `Received a completed event for test with unknown id '1.12'. Registered test ids: '[1.1, 1.2, 1.11, :test, 1.10]'\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Received a completed event for test with unknown id '1.12'.

I am aware that this is a contrived example, but I assure you, it did actually happen to our existing tests :)\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Check out https://github.com/mmorrisontx/junit5-3083-repro\r\n* ./gradlew test\r\n* Output fails due to `Received a completed event for test with unknown id`\r\n* If you replace junit dependencies with 5.8.2, tests pass.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please insert a code snippet or a link to another repo along with instructions how to reproduce the issue here.
