is a specific sub-issue of #806.\r\n\r\nI've been adapting JUnit Platform to run in an OSGi environment as part of the Bndtools project (see bndtools/bnd#3145). This project consists of a `BundleEngine` which discovers test bundles in the running OSGi framework, and then delegates to other TestEngines it finds in the environment for each such bundle that it finds.\r\n\r\nIt became apparent during this implementation that the discovery selectors that do class loading (eg, selectClass(String) and selectMethod(String, String)) ideally needed variants that allowed you to explicitly specify the classloader, rather than always using the default classloader. I had to write a fair bit of code to work around the lack of such a feature when I implemented `BundleEngine`.\r\n\r\nThe call to `ReflectionUtils.tryToLoadClass(String)`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/cfe9a9928a6c040e8fd6edf96ed70e7eaac94a80/junit-platform-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/engine/discovery/ClassSelector.java#L74-L76\r\n\r\n...could then simply be replaced with a call to the `ReflectionUtils.tryToLoadClass(String, ClassLoader)` variant (and possibly update the precondition error message to indicate which classloader it used to try and load the class).\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility, if the classloader is not explicitly specified, simply use the default classloader (current behaviour).","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
