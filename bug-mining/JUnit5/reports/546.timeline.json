@marcphilipp  asked me to push my try for a custom asciidoc theme (see #3071 ):\r\n\r\nWhat I tried first was chaning the default theme to one of the other build-in themes, e.g. `colorful`.\r\nThis was done easy, as you only have to change the `index.adoc` and add the `:rouge-style: colorful` tag, run the gradle task \"asciidoc\" and the colorful theme is applied.\r\nIt doesn't matter if you set the attribute in the `documentation.gradle.kts` file - set settings in this file are not picked up anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nI then tried to create an own theme, by starting to just take the example from [the asciidoc example](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/theme/source-highlighting-theme/), and just chaning some colors to blue, to make them visual and to see that the theme is picked up. I also added the file to the copy ressources list (`documentation.gradle.kts`) as the guide says you have to do so.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the file is copies to `build\\docs\\asciidoc\\resources\\themes\\` but it does not get picked up, even I figured out that the pure existence of the file, regardless if the new added file / theme is mentioned anyway breaks the theme usage. So even when the `colorful` theme is set, the guide is rendered in default theme. The name / location of the theme file or the theme doesn't change anything about this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tried to run Gradle with \"--debug\" (as described in the [IntelliJ Gradle Debug docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-tasks.html)), but no debug information were written.\r\n\r\nWell and this whole situation is what blows my mind since hours.\r\n\r\nWhat you see in the PR is that the added file breaks the theme usage. Only thing that works with the current state of this PR is the copying of the file due `include(\"resources/themes/rogue_junit.rb\")` in the Gradle-file. If you comment out those and remove the theme file, you will see that the setting to colorful is used again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9073627516,"node_id":"COE_lADOAbwRH85Ujd_2zwAAAAIc1JF8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/9073627516","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-22T20:43:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
