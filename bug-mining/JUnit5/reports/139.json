Overview\r\n\r\nCopied from https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/1016#issuecomment-334091550\r\n\r\nI maybe found a bug with the CsvSource parser for empty strings. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n    @CsvSource({\r\n        \"  '', Content\",\r\n        \"  '',      ''\",\r\n        \"  '', ''     \",\r\n    })\r\nvoid contentTest(final String one, final String two) {\r\n  Assertions.assertNotNull(two);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere in the second test the string two is, as expected an empty string, in the third test the string two is ```null```. Obviously the parser is confused by the trailing blanks of the second parameter.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using junit jupiter version 5.0.0.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Upgrade to `univocity-parsers` version 2.5.8 when available and remove [TODO](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/commit/62055132ae226f7e99031d779926ed553a8ed543#diff-a25bf3dde2d64a209206c59a9742f823R26)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
