`@ParameterizedTest` I have to declare test name explicitly.\r\nThat is sad.\r\n\r\nWhat if JUnit generated something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n[3] httpImplementation=HttpClient4, targetHost=127.0.0.1, sourceIp=/127.0.0.1\r\n[1] httpImplementation=HttpClient4, targetHost=127.0.0.1, sourceIp=/fe80:0:0:0:0:0:0:1%lo0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n?\r\n\r\nIt would make lots of tests and test failures easier to understand.\r\nI'm OK if it is `{arguments_with_names}`. Then I could create `@ParameterizedTestWithArgNames` annotation that uses detailed name.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS. I've seen https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1154, however, I don't really want to deal and/or declare resolvers.","closed_by":{"login":"juliette-derancourt","id":28359762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzU5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28359762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt","html_url":"https://github.com/juliette-derancourt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
