just got bitten by the (IMHO counter-intuitive) behavior of `@TempDir`: When using it in multiple places, each injection point gets the **same** directory injected. That is, the following does not do what one would intuitively expect:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nvoid test(@TempDir File source, @TempDir File target) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth `source` and `target` point to the same directory!\r\n\r\nOf course, you can work around this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nvoid test(@TempDir File tempDir) {\r\n    File source = new File(tempDir, \"source\");\r\n    File target = new File(tempDir, \"target\");\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this feels unnecessarily complex for this, IMHO, rather common use case.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, injecting the same temporary directory in multiple places is _really_ what is desired, one can even imagine the following API to still support that use case:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@TempDir(\"id\") Path samePath;\r\n\r\nvoid test(@TempDir(\"id\") File sameDir) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] An update to `TemporaryDirectory` which sets up (and tears down) a new temporary directory at each injection point.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1967/reactions","total_count":61,"+1":60,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
