have tests targeting a legacy library, which unfortunately exposes parameters with concrete types of collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, etc.) instead of the corresponding interfaces.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `EmptyArgumentsProvider` implementation targets only interfaces:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/4cd1fc064c6864d01ccacf08c4117c7c39d05e0a/junit-jupiter-params/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/EmptyArgumentsProvider.java#L47-L55\r\n\r\nso a test like the following doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n@EmptySource\r\nvoid test(ArrayList<?> list) {\r\n   ...\r\n   legacyService.call(list);\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe workaround is a `@MethodSource` taking care of the instantiation of the concrete type.\r\n\r\nWould you accept enhancing the implementation of `EmptyArgumentsProvider` to also support the concrete types of the JDK? If yes, happy to raise a PR about it.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] `@EmptySource` provides an empty instance of the JDK concrete types for `List`, `Set` and `Map`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2791/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2791/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
