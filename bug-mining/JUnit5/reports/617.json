Overview\r\n\r\n`TestExecutionResultConditions` currently provides a `cause()` condition that matches if an exception's cause matches all supplied conditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, unless I've overlooked something, there is currently no easy way to create a condition that matches if an exception's **root** cause matches all supplied conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile writing tests for the Spring Framework, I had a need for a `rootCause()` condition and implemented that in a new [`EngineTestKitUtils`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/3a448701f73fc3f0483a11d1f04f4861925ab62d/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/junit/EngineTestKitUtils.java#L47-L53) utility class.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce `rootCause()` condition in `TestExecutionResultConditions`.\r\n- [x] Document in Release Notes.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
