Overview\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #2630, we should introduce a new `ConfigurationParameters getConfigurationParameters()` method in the `TestPlan` so that a `TestExecutionListener` can access the JUnit Platform configuration parameters instead of having to rely on JVM system properties or other means for the user to configure a listener.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce `ConfigurationParameters getConfigurationParameters()` in the `TestPlan`.\r\n- [x] Refactor `UniqueIdTrackingListener` to use configuration parameters instead of system properties once #2630 has been merged into `main`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
