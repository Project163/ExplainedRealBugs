Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\n\r\nWhen using JUnit 5 (and also 4) with version `1.8.2` for the launcher and `5.8.2` for `jupiter` I have been observing the presence of the following warning: `WARNING: Error scanning files for URI jar: ...` followed immediately by `java.nio.file.FileSystemAlreadyExistsException` emitted from the JUnit code `jdk.zipfs/jdk.nio.zipfs.ZipFileSystemProvider.newFileSystem(ZipFileSystemProvider.java:102)` at `org.junit.platform.commons.util.CloseablePath.createForJarFileSystem(CloseablePath.java:57)`. \r\n\r\nI am making a program to run a suite of JUnit tests across multiple threads, and using the JUnit launcher to perform test execution. I suspect this issue is caused by the JUnit `.exectue()` method running test discovery each time I invoke the method, which causes a race condition on the java filesystem object that JUnit creates. For reference, I believe that this class is not thread safe https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/main/junit-platform-commons/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/commons/util/CloseablePath.java. I expect JUnit to produce no warnings when I execute tests across threads.  \r\n\r\nSince JUnit no longer supports performing test discovery once for multiple executions (which is ideal for my use case), I am forced to perform repeated test discovery each time I invoke the JUnit launcher. Moreover, it seems that the decision to repeatedly do test discovery on each execution was made by JUnit recently https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2379. \r\n\r\nThe environment I run my program in requires the tests to be in `.jar` files. When the tests are not in a `.jar` file the error coming from `ZipFileSystemProvider` does not happen. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI created a simple program https://github.com/oscargolding/junit-load-test that shows the presence of the bug. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the warning clone the project then run the following commands.\r\n\r\nFirst build the project and get the resulting `.jar` file. Then place the file into a relevant directory (I picked `/tmp/1/lib`). \r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew build\r\n$ mkdir -p /tmp/1/lib\r\n$ cp ./build/distributions/junit-load-tst-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /tmp/1/lib/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen copy all the junit dependency `.jar` files (listed below) that are cached under the directory `~/.gradle/` into `/tmp/1/lib/`. \r\n\r\n```\r\njunit-jupiter-api-5.8.2.jar\r\njunit-jupiter-engine-5.8.2.jar\r\njunit-platform-commons-1.8.2.jar\r\njunit-platform-engine-1.8.2.jar\r\njunit-platform-launcher-1.8.2.jar\r\njunit-platform-runner-1.8.2.jar\r\njunit-platform-suite-api-1.8.2.jar\r\njunit-platform-suite-commons-1.8.2.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally run the commands below to reproduce the warning. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /tmp/1\r\n$ java -cp \"./lib/*\" \"org.example.Main\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Please insert a code snippet or a link to another repo along with instructions how to reproduce the issue here.
