Overview\n\nIn Spring Framework's test suite, I introduced a test fixture to replicate an issued reported by a user, where the user had a `@Nested` test class that extended an `abstract` inner class.\n\nThat is naturally supported and works fine; however, the new discovery issue reporting feature introduced in JUnit 5.13 incorrectly warns that such a declaration is invalid.\n\nFor example, when running [`MockitoBeanNestedAndTypeHierarchiesWithSuperclassPresentTwiceTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/bean/override/mockito/MockitoBeanNestedAndTypeHierarchiesWithSuperclassPresentTwiceTests.java) in `spring-test`, I see the following warning.\n\n```\nWARNING: TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' encountered a non-critical issue during test discovery:\n\n(1) [WARNING] Inner class 'org.springframework.test.context.bean.override.mockito.MockitoBeanNestedAndTypeHierarchiesWithEnclosingClassPresentTwiceTests$AbstractBaseClassForNestedTests' looks like it was intended to be a test class but will not be executed. It must be static or annotated with @Nested.\n    Source: ClassSource [className = 'org.springframework.test.context.bean.override.mockito.MockitoBeanNestedAndTypeHierarchiesWithEnclosingClassPresentTwiceTests$AbstractBaseClassForNestedTests', filePosition = null]\n            at org.springframework.test.context.bean.override.mockito.MockitoBeanNestedAndTypeHierarchiesWithEnclosingClassPresentTwiceTests$AbstractBaseClassForNestedTests.<no-method>(SourceFile:0)\n```\n\nNote that `AbstractBaseClassForNestedTests` is inherited from [`AbstractMockitoBeanNestedAndTypeHierarchiesWithSuperclassPresentTwiceTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/bean/override/mockito/AbstractMockitoBeanNestedAndTypeHierarchiesWithSuperclassPresentTwiceTests.java), and it is intentionally not \"static or annotated with `@Nested`.\"\n\nThus, I think the discovery issue check should be updated so that it does not report that, if the inner class in question is `abstract`.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4636 \n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
