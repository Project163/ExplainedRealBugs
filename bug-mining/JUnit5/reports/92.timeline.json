Status Quo\r\n\r\nDue to the investigative work performed in conjunction with #815, I noticed that the JUnit Platform currently has no support for loading classes by name for multidimensional arrays.\r\n\r\nConsequently, it is currently impossible to create a `MethodSelector` (e.g., via `DiscoverySelectors`) which selects a method by _fully qualified method name_ if the method accepts a multidimensional array as an argument.\r\n\r\nA soon-to-be common use case for such a method selection would be a `@ParameterizedTest` that accepts `int[][][]` or `String[][]` as an argument.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nAs an intermediary step in #815, I added support for 2D arrays for primitives in `ReflectionUtils`. That solution is fine in terms of a hard-coded solution for common use cases; however, we need a generic solution to support multidimensional primitive arrays and object arrays.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #810 \r\n- #815 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Support class loading by name for multidimensional primitive arrays.\r\n  - [x] using JVM internal syntax\r\n  - [x] using source code syntax\r\n- [x] Support class loading by name for multidimensional object arrays.\r\n  - [x] using JVM internal syntax\r\n  - [x] using source code syntax\r\n- [x] Resolve all TODOs in `ReflectionUtilsTests` and `DiscoverySelectorsTests`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1064605969,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTA2NDYwNTk2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1064605969","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-01T22:04:26Z","rename":{"from":"UniqueId.parse
