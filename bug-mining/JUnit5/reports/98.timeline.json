has these two methods: `isTest()` and `isContainer()`. As per my understanding, `isTest()` is used to identify a test case that is executed and `isContainer()` is used to identify a container of these test cases. Hence, a `@TestFactory` method is a container and not a test.\n\nIs there anything else to the meaning of `isContainer()`? If not, these two are exactly opposite of each other and one of them can be removed.\n\nAlso, it would be useful to have another method called as `isTestFactory()`, which can be used to identify a container method.

Overview\r\n\r\nIn [Specsy](http://specsy.org/), it's not known before executing a test whether its TestDescriptor has children or not. The nested tests are discovered dynamically while the test is executed. This holds true also for the top-level test, which is the test class itself. Thus conceptually all TestDescriptors are both tests and containers. This caused a problem with IntelliJ IDEA test results (see [this comment](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-148288#comment=27-1518123) and [its reply](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-148288#comment=27-1518474)) and I had to do [a workaround](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-148288#comment=27-1518757).\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\nThis issue should be not closed until the following issues have been resolved.\r\n\r\n- [ ] What does JUnit mean by the concepts of \"test\" and \"container\"?\r\n- [ ] How should IDEs and other tools change their behavior based on those variables?\r\n   - If they shouldn't change behavior, then why do the variables exist?\r\n- [ ] What about the case of isTest()=false and isContainer()=false?\r\n- [ ] What about defining them dynamically based on whether there are children? (I tried it. IntelliJ IDEA doesn't notice that the values change during test execution.)\r\n- [ ] Would it be possible to remove both concepts, and just check whether a TestDescriptor has children?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":822924865,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50ODIyOTI0ODY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/822924865","actor":{"login":"bechte","id":453673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte","html_url":"https://github.com/bechte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bechte/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-13T18:27:20Z","label":{"name":"in

not being _in progress_ I started looking into it. I have done an initial investigation on how to proceed with this and I have come up with these points and questions.\r\n\r\nThe to be deprecated methods are used in quite a few places and we will have to express the calling code's intent without using these methods.\r\n\r\nFrom my study of this issue and its related ones, I came to these points on how to do the expression. I would appreciate your opinion and comments on them.\r\n\r\n* Do not use the notion of container to distinguish `Identifiers, Descriptors`.\r\n  * This then begs the question how to express eg `jupiter.engine.DisabledTests` \r\n   which uses `ExecutionEventRecorder::getContainerSkippedCount` or tests using\r\n  `platform.engine.test.event.ExecutionEventConditions::container`\r\n\r\n* When we need to disregard Descriptors or Identifiers that in essense do no \r\n  represent any testing the we will use the `isTest() || [will]RegistersTests()`\r\n\r\nNot related with how to express the callers intent, these also require consideration:\r\n* From looking into the code I think `willRegisterTests` is not a good name \r\n  because it implies that this `Identifier, Descriptor` will do the registration\r\n  in the future but we do need to check this even after we have registered tests\r\n  so this could become misleading. `registersTests()` seems better to me\r\n* This leads in many cases to simply replace the `isContainer()` with \r\n  `registersTests()` which still implies the notion/concept of a container.\r\n\r\n

guys,\r\n\r\nI have not looked into PR #720 , but... I _can_ shed some light on the original concepts and rationale in play here.\r\n\r\n> is test = is not container ... an identifier/descriptor is a test or it is a container; never both or none.\r\n\r\nFor starters, I do not agree with the above assumption that \"an identifier/descriptor is never both a test and a container\".\r\n\r\nHere are some things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\n1. Do **not** look at JUnit Jupiter when considering whether it makes sense for a something to be both a test and a container.\r\n    - JUnit Jupiter is merely _one_ implementation of a `TestEngine`: it is **not** the guiding light for how all test engines must work.\r\n1. Consider that a different testing framework running on the JUnit Platform might have a need for a node in the test tree that is simultaneously a test **and** a container.\r\n    - In fact, I believe that the Specsy framework does exactly that. If it's not Specsy, it's something else I have seen.\r\n\r\nIn summary, for this particular feature we have to focus on the _big picture_, the JUnit Platform. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I believe we need the following possible states for a node -- where being neither a container nor a test is not an option.\r\n\r\n1. is a container\r\n1. is a test\r\n1. is a container and a test\r\n\r\nPerhaps an enum would best address this topic.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/286083329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
