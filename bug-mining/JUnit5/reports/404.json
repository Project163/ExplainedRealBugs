Overview\r\n\r\nThe original intention of `StringUtils.nullSafeToString` was that it does not throw a `NullPointerException`, not that it never returns `null`.\r\n\r\nHowever, as discussed in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/2408#issuecomment-692733493, the Javadoc states that `StringUtils.nullSafeToString` never returns `null`, which can occur if the invocation of `toString()` returns `null`. Thus, the implementation is not aligned with the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Change the behavior of `StringUtils.nullSafeToString` so that it returns `\"null\"` if the invocation of `toString()` returns `null`.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2410/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
