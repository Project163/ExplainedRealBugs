`.gitignore` patterns are not tied to the location of `.gitignore` file by default.\r\n\r\nIn other words, `build/` ignores `build` folders in all the possible subfolders.\r\nIn other words, if one day someone creates `org.junit.build.tools` Kotlin/Java package, then it would be excluded as well.\r\n\r\nIt might result in sad stories up to the point when the code might be lost (e.g. developer thinks the code is kept in Git, but in fact it is not there).\r\n\r\nIn the same way, `*/out/*` duplicates `out/` pattern.\r\n\r\nGit enables to specify paths \"relative to .gitignore location\" by prefixing the patterns with `/`\r\n\r\nSo I suggest to use the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/build/\r\n/*/build/\r\n\r\n/out/\r\n/*/out/\r\n\r\n/bin/\r\n/*/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also
