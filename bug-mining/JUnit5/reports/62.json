Overview\r\n\r\nThe current console standalone jar is uploaded with the \"full\" pom file, which leads to too many dependent jars to be downloaded when you only want and need the standalone

by-passing http://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/#default_java_groovy_tasks : \r\n\r\n_Configures the uploadShadow task (as part of the maven plugin) with the following behavior:_\r\n- _Removes the
