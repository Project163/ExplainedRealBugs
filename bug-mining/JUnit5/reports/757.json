currently possible to select multiple classes by invoking `selectClass(MyTests.class)` multiple times; however, it would be beneficial to have `selectClasses(Class<?>... classes)` and `selectClasses(String... classNames)` variants in `DiscoverySelectors`.\n\nFor example, when using the `Launcher` or `EngineTestKit` APIs in testing-the-tests scenarios we often encounter code like the following.\n\n```java\nEngineTestKit.engine(\"junit-jupiter\")\n\t\t.selectors(\n\t\t\tselectClass(TestClass1A.class),\n\t\t\tselectClass(TestClass1B.class),\n\t\t\tselectClass(TestClass2A.class),\n\t\t\tselectClass(TestClass2B.class)\n\t\t)\n\t\t...\n```\n\nIt would be much nicer to be able to achieve that via the following.\n\n```java\nEngineTestKit.engine(\"junit-jupiter\")\n\t\t.selectors(\n\t\t\tselectClasses(\n\t\t\t\tTestClass1A.class,\n\t\t\t\tTestClass1B.class,\n\t\t\t\tTestClass2A.class,\n\t\t\t\tTestClass2B.class\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t)\n\t\t...\n```\n\nAs a proof of concept, I implemented one of the variants for myself in the Spring Framework test suite.\n\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/57fa52262e7ada6833f7640d91fef1fe673cdff3/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/cache/UnusedContextsIntegrationTests.java#L204-L214\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4860/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
