Overview\r\n\r\n- (X) **Bug report.** When assertions fail during a test run and provide a multi-line message (as is common with the Hamcrest assertions and matchers, the test tree is interrupted when running via the console or Gradle.  This problem is also seen when ```assertAll()``` throws a ```MultipleFailuresError```.  The example below demonstrates both these failure conditions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertAllExample() {\r\n\tassertAll(\r\n\t\t() -> { throw new AssertionError(new Throwable(\"first thing went wrong\")); },\r\n\t\t() -> { throw new AssertionError(new Throwable(\"second thing went wrong\")); },\r\n\t\t() -> assertThat(\"ERROR! - something is broke\", not(containsString(\"ERROR!\")))\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertOneExample() {\r\n\tassertTrue(false, \"Wasn't expecting that!\\n\\nNow I've broken the tree\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output from when these tests are run via Gradle is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n│  ├─ example.testrule.ErrorCollectorJupiterDemo\r\n│  │  ├─ assertAllExample ✘ Multiple Failures (3 failures)\r\n        java.lang.Throwable: first thing went wrong\r\n        java.lang.Throwable: second thing went wrong\r\n        \r\nExpected: not a string containing \"ERROR!\"\r\n     but: was \"ERROR! - something is broke\"\r\n│  │  ├─ assertOneExample ✘ Wasn't expecting that!\r\n\r\nNow I've broken the tree\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Continue the tree structure across line breaks similar to the
