am still interested in working on this! Just don't have a lot of time for it.\r\n\r\nI started by doing a bit of reading and thinking.\r\n\r\nBits of the JDK where we should either capture output, or document that we can't capture output, etc:\r\n\r\n- System.out + System.err\r\n- java.io.Console\r\n- java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler\r\n- System.setOut + System.setErr\r\n- Threads used inside tests\r\n\r\nGradle captures output from tests, so it might be a good benchmark to try to do whatever Gradle does. I tried to find out how it does whatever it does, but the Gradle codebase is absolutely labyrinthine; i think the key point is [DefaultStandardOutputRedirector](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/testing-base/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/tasks/testing/processors/DefaultStandardOutputRedirector.java), but i'm not sure.\r\n\r\nAlso interesting is the [RedirectStdOutAndErr](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/internal-testing/src/main/groovy/org/gradle/util/internal/RedirectStdOutAndErr.java) JUnit rule they use in testing.\r\n\r\n~~I might get a chance to actually try some code next weekend ...~~ Just remembered there's a film festival on!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1567027139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomwhoiscontrary","id":539012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTAxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/539012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary","html_url":"https://github.com/tomwhoiscontrary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomwhoiscontrary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1587608078","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3166#issuecomment-1587608078","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3166","id":1587608078,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH85eoPoO","user":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-12T15:51:02Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T15:51:02Z","body":"Output capturing is already implemented in JUnit (as report entries): https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-capturing-output\n\nI think we should try reusing that in some form but avoid the indirection of capturing it as strings.
