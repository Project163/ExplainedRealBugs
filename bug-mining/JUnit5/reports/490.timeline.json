using Junit 5.4.1 and am experiencing a weird issue related to parallelism.\r\n\r\nI have a set of Tests that I want to execute in parallel. 4 of these tests are tagged with the tag \"main\". Which I want to execute using maven. However I only want to execute 2 of them at the same time. Thus I configured jUnit 5 as follows:\r\n\r\n`junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed\r\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=2`\r\n\r\nThis config works when I invoke the following mvn command:\r\n\r\n`mvn test`\r\n\r\nHowever, when i add the parameter to only execute the Tests tagged with main:\r\n\r\n`mvn test -Dgroups=main`\r\n\r\nALL of the tests (meaning 4) tagged with \"main\" are executed in parallel, when only 2 should be executed at the same time. It seems that somehow, the parallelism count is ignored. Unfortunately I can't verify which setting is used by JUnit5 or if this bug is related to mvn surefire or Junit5\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a Test Suite with 5 or more Tests\r\n- Tag 4 of them with a tag (e.g main)\r\n- invoke mvn test -Dgroups=main\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.4.1 Jupiter / no vintage / 1.4.1 platform\r\n - Build
