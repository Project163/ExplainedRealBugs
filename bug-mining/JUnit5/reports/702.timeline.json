wanted to supply an MCVE, but I was not able to, as I was not able to find a way to influence the order in which the `@TempDir` handling extension initializes classes. Even a static initializer in the affected classes is executed after (!?!) the extension injected the static fields, but I try to describe the problem.\r\n\r\nIf you have a construct like\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Execution(CONCURRENT)\r\nabstract class Base {\r\n    @TempDir\r\n    static Path tempDir;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void foo() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass A extends Base {}\r\nclass B extends Base {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand now run `A` and `B` in parallel, the extension creates one temp directory for `A` and one temp directory for `B`.\r\nThen it sets the `Base.tempDir` field for the one that happens to execute first, let's call it `SubFirst`.\r\nThen it sets the same field for the one that happens to execute second, let's call it `SubSecond`, and thus overwrites the value written for `SubFirst` as it is a static field in `Base`.\r\n\r\nNow A and B both work with the same temporary directory.\r\nThis can already mean problems of course.\r\n\r\nIn my case it did not yet cause problems, as the test created a further subdirectory depending on the actual class name, so there was no conflict in the actual files created and verified.\r\n\r\nBut then, if `SubSecond` is finished first, its temp directory is deleted, and now `SubFirst` has a problem if he still used the temporary directory as suddenly its files and even the folder might be deleted already.\r\n\r\nI guess this is hard to \"do right\", but it is at least majorly confusing.\r\n\r\nI actually exepected the scope of the `tempDir` to be for `A` and `B` and the directory only getting deleted after all subclasses are finished executing which would have been exactly what I needed. (I solved it differently now).\r\n\r\nAnother possibility might be to either disallow static tempdir fields in concurrent specs, or to automatically add some read-write resource so that the test classes are not run in

\r\nThanks for suggesting an improvement to Cucumber! 💖\r\n\r\nUse the questions below to help explain why you think this change is needed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### 🤔 What's the problem you're trying to solve?\r\n\r\ncleaning dependencies initialized by Google Guice container.\r\nwhen working with selenium it is \"cheap\" to close and open a new WebDriver for every scenario (working with the existing \"io.cucumber.guice.ScenarioScoped\" option),\r\nbut when working with Appium it can take up 2-3 minutes for each session - in that case, we need to re-use the same session and install/uninstall the app to save this time. \r\nthere is no \"session\" scope Cucumber Guice - and also there is no \"destroy\" method similar to what spring+ cucumber has.\r\n**so there is no way to terminate the object in case it's used in the entire session.**\r\n\r\nthe easiest thing I think will be to detect if the scenario is last and perform cleanup on the last after hook and bind the object into an instance variable in order to re-use it in all of the scenarios.  \r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\n\r\n### ✨ What's your proposed solution?\r\n\r\nadd a boolean check to the scenario e.g\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @After\r\n    public void closeIosDriver(Scenario scenario) {\r\n        if (scenario.isLast()) {\r\n            iosDriver.quit();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\n### ⛏ Have you considered any alternatives or workarounds?\r\n\r\nthe alternative is bad - working with static variables all over the place and cleaning them in the afterAll static hook which is not available for Guice container \r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n### 📚 Any additional context?\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context, references or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\nusing the latest cucumber + Guice + Cucumber Guice dependencies.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n*This text was originally generated from a [template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates), then edited by hand.

my deepest respects for the work you have done with cucumber.\r\nIt is a simply fascinating tool.\r\n\r\nI love it so much that when I arrived on the project on which I am today,\r\nthe use that my team made of it challenged me.\r\n\r\nThey executed their `1450 scenarios` in `6 hours`, after studying all your\r\ndocumentations and innovations such as `@ScenarioScope`, we achieved a runtime\r\nof `17min`, for the same 1450 tests!\r\n\r\nWell ok I admit that they also used too much `Thread.sleep`, which I transformed\r\ninto `Selenium's Fluent Wait` ;)\r\n\r\nIt's one of the accomplishments I'm most proud of in my career and I wanted to\r\nshare it with you ladies and gentlemen, keep up the excellent work :)\r\n\r\n### 👓 What did you see?\r\n\r\nWhen I use the following Maven property `failsafe.rerunFailingTestsCount`,\r\nproperty automatically recognized by the `maven-failsafe-plugin`,\r\nI get the following actual incomplete report :\r\n\r\n![cucumber_actual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1810484/210869781-e3a3098c-af57-4ec6-9dd2-b465f70ab568.png)\r\n\r\n### ✅ What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the property, the report is as expected, 8 errors in\r\ntotal :\r\n\r\n![cucumber_expected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1810484/210870301-7c7adba6-5fa5-4259-9d7c-8954576412d8.png)\r\n\r\nAs a comparison, we're also using  the excellent tool `maven-cucumber-reporting`\r\nby @damianszczepanik and it seems to support the failsafe property just fine as\r\nyou can see below :)\r\n\r\n![cucumber_expected2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1810484/210878999-b0c49ae3-0984-417c-b06f-65dafc129df9.png)\r\n\r\n### 📦 Which tool/library version are you using?\r\n\r\nI observe the problem on the last 2 versions, i.e. `7.11.0-SNAPSHOT` and\r\n`7.10.1`,  we are using `jDK 11,` `Maven 3.8.7` and below the other libraries\r\n\r\n![cucumber_version-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1810484/210872348-30a7e618-ed37-41b1-afe8-5ed2fcc9e4f5.png)\r\n![cucumber_version-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1810484/210872357-71baf793-9780-488d-941d-5269ff4ac1cc.png)\r\n\r\n### 🔬 How could we reproduce it?\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Install `7.11.0-SNAPSHOT`\r\n2. Create any feature\r\n3. In this feature, place 2 failing scenarios and 1 success\r\n4. Setup failsafe, this is our setting  \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!--\r\n  Tests d'intégration IT (Selenium/Cucumber)\r\n  ==========================================\r\n-->\r\n<plugin>\r\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>\r\n    <executions>\r\n        <execution>\r\n            <id>integration-tests</id>\r\n            <goals>\r\n                <goal>integration-test</goal>\r\n                <goal>verify</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n            <configuration>\r\n                <argLine>${jacoco.argLine.coverage} ${jacoco.argLine}</argLine>\r\n                <skip>${skipITs}</skip>\r\n                <useUnlimitedThreads>false</useUnlimitedThreads>\r\n                <threadCount>${crelog.cucumber.thread.max}</threadCount>\r\n                <perCoreThreadCount>false</perCoreThreadCount>\r\n                <parallel>classesAndMethods</parallel>\r\n                <includes>\r\n                    <include>**/AllSeleniumITs.java</include>\r\n                </includes>\r\n            </configuration>\r\n        </execution>\r\n    </executions>\r\n</plugin>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<properties>\r\n  <!--\r\n      Options liées au paralèllisme des TI remontées ici pour mise en évidence simplifiée\r\n      (voir doc un peu plus bas ci-dessous pour usage)\r\n  -->\r\n  <cucumber.execution.parallel.enabled>true</cucumber.execution.parallel.enabled>\r\n  <crelog.webdriver.scope>scenario</crelog.webdriver.scope>\r\n  <!--\r\n      Quelques durées observées :\r\n      ===========================\r\n        - 20x threads   : [INFO] cl-extranet-web ....................................

would like to inject a test class’ field from my launcher before executing the test. IIUC, this is [currently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47633819/injecting-test-classes-created-by-platform-launcher) [impossible](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3747). This feature request documents the reason I (think that I) need this.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nI develop a software to grade student’s work. The teacher would write a unit test then run my software. My software would download student 1’s work, compile it on the fly, execute the teacher test on the student 1 work, grade it; download student 2’s work, compile it on the fly, execute the teacher test on the student 2 work, grade it; and so on for each students; and then return a list of all grades to the user.\r\n\r\n### More details\r\nThe teacher would ask students to implement an interface that she provides, say, `Additioner`.\r\nThe teacher would write a unit test class that has a field `Additioner studentAdditioner` and test methods that use that field.\r\nMy software compiles student 1’s class, say, `MyAdditioner`, that implements `Additioner`, and should inject an instance of that class into the field `studentAdditioner` so that the teacher unit test will run on the student 1 instance.\r\n\r\n### Missing\r\nMy software is able to use JUnit’s API to launch the teacher test, but is unable to inject the student instance into the test field. Note that such injection must happen in the context that creates the launcher, not in the context of the junit test, as the test is started by my software.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nAs suggested in the linked threads, one could use JNDI or other external means of communicating an instance, but this would introduce unnecessary complexity and probably be non-transparent to my users (i.e., the teacher).\r\n\r\nSorry if I misunderstood the discussions of the linked threads and it is actually possible, in which case I’d be glad to be directed to some way of proceeding.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3786/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3786/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/2139060423","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2816#issuecomment-2139060423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2816","id":2139060423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH85_f3jH","user":{"login":"PinkFloyded","id":11929269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTI5MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11929269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded","html_url":"https://github.com/PinkFloyded","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PinkFloyded/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-30T08:44:41Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T08:44:41Z","body":"Hi @marcphilipp, if there is interest in this feature, I can take a stab at implementing this.
