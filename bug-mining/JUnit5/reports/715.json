discussion in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/discussions/4583 combined with the linked issue https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/eclipse.jdt.core/issues/4053 shows that two bugs are hiding here. One is in JUnit:\n\nWhen...\n```\n      --uid, --select-unique-id=UNIQUE-ID...\n                             Select a unique id for test discovery. This option can be\n                               repeated.\n```\n...is used as the sole selector, the console launcher shows a false error message reading:\n\n```\nPlease specify an explicit selector option or use `--scan-class-path` or `--scan-modules`\n```\n\nThere exists a work-around, though. Use `--select uid:UNIQUE-ID...` to prevent the error to happen.\n\nAccording to what I read from https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/eclipse.jdt.core/issues/4053, the other bug seems to be in `ecj` and therefore cannot be addressed here.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
