Overview\r\n\r\nAs discovered by @graydavid in #3433, there is an issue regarding extension registration via `@ExtendWith` on instance fields.\r\n\r\nThe following is a simplification of the `RandomNumberDemo` from the User Guide which demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// @ExtendWith(RandomNumberExtension.class)\r\nclass RandomNumberDemoTest {\r\n\r\n\t@Random\r\n\tInteger randomNumber;\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tvoid test() {\r\n\t\tassertThat(this.randomNumber).isNotNull();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above test fails; however, if you annotate the test class with `@ExtendWith(RandomNumberExtension.class)` the test then passes.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `ClassBasedTestDescriptor#instantiateAndPostProcessTestInstance()` invokes `ExtensionUtils.registerExtensionsFromFields()` too late.\r\n\r\nI even added the following comment when I introduced that support.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// In addition, we register extensions from instance fields here since the\r\n// best time to do that is immediately following test class instantiation\r\n// and post processing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, that is not the \"best time to do that\" when a field is annotated (or meta-annotated in the case of `@Random`) with an `@ExtendWith` annotation that registers an extension that implements `TestInstancePostProcessor`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #3433\r\n- #3463\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Revise the usage of `ExtensionUtils.registerExtensionsFromFields()` so that a `TestInstancePostProcessor` can be registered via `@ExtendWith` on a non-static field.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
