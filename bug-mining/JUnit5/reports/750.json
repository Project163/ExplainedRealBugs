Background\n\nWhile working on #4698, I created tests using _blank_ strings like the following.\n\n```java\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n@ParameterizedTest\n@NullSource\n@ValueSource(strings = { \"\", \" \", \"   \", \"\\t\", \"\\r\", \"\\r\\n\", \"\\n\" })\n@interface EmptyReasonsTest {\n}\n```\n\nThat produces display names similar to the following, which are not very useful since the last 7 are identical.\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bd17797-7d6d-497b-b99a-4f4ec5fb046b\" />\n\nIf I wrap the values in single quotes as follows...\n\n```java\n@ParameterizedTest(name = \"[{index}] reason=''{0}''\")\n```\n\n... the results are better.\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e249508-8c88-4073-bdd8-9a9ee4d43622\" />\n\n## Proposal\n\nBut... I think we can do even better.\n\nNamely if we replace non-printable characters, then configuration like this...\n\n```java\n@ParameterizedTest(name = \"[{index}] reason=''{0}''\")\n@NullSource\n@ValueSource(strings = { \"\", \" \", \"   \", \"\\t\", \"\\r\", \"\\r\\n\", \"\\n\", \"\\u200B\" })\n```\n\n... could have display names like this:\n\n<img width=\"361\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/361de004-fd78-4148-bade-54f44626bb90\" />\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nInvoking the following from `ParameterizedInvocationNameFormatter.MessageFormatPartialFormatter`'s `makeReadable()` method resulted in the last screenshot in the _Proposal_ section.\n\n```java\nprivate String replaceNonPrintableCharacters(String string) {\n\treturn string\n\t\t\t.replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")\n\t\t\t.replace(\"\\r\", \"\\\\r\")\n\t\t\t.replace(\"\\t\", \"\\\\t\")\n\t\t\t.replaceAll(\"[\\\\p{Cc}\\\\p{Cf}\\\\p{Co}\\\\p{Cn}]\", \"?\");\n}\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #1713\n- #4716 \n- #4783 \n- #4786 \n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4714/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4714/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
