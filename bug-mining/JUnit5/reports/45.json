was testing JUnit 5's lifecycle in regards to the different extension types for a blog I wrote. In doing so I found out that `TestInstancePostProcessor` extensions are not invoked when declared on a test method like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class SomeTest {\r\n  @Test\r\n  @ExtendsWith(MyTestInstancePostProcessor.class)\r\n  void testSomething(){\r\n    ..\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWas this an oversight, or a deliberate decision? On the one hand I find it hard to formulate a viable usecase for having a special post processor just for a single method. But on the other hand: Every method is invoked on its own 'personal' test class instance - so why not allow it?\r\n\r\nThe code I used to test this is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/nt-ca-aqe/blog-junit5-test-lifecycle/tree/master/src/test/java/example), specifically the [`TestsWithExtensionsOnOneMethod`](https://github.com/nt-ca-aqe/blog-junit5-test-lifecycle/blob/master/src/test/java/example/TestsWithExtensionsOnOneMethod.java) test class.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
