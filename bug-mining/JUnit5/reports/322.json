5.5.2\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following empty test. With JUnit 4 it takes about 2 seconds to run, with the JUnit 5 vintage engine it takes about 250 seconds to run.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/marschall/junit5-Segment-hashCode/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/marschall/junit5/segmenthashcode/ReproducerTest.java\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nWe have a JUnit 4 Parameterized test with about 70'000 total tests. 3 Tests with about 20'000 parameters. The test runs massively slower with the JUnit 5 vintage engine compared to the the JUnit 4 engine.\r\n\r\nProfiling highlights the following hot spots:\r\n\r\n- `TestRun#getInProgressTestDescriptorsWithSyntheticStartEvents` has a bad complexity (probably O(N²)) because every time it iterates over all started descriptors, it gets slower the more tests you have\r\n- `UniqueId#hashCode` is not memoized \r\n- `UniqueId#toString` is not memoized\r\n\r\nSee the following flight recording\r\n\r\n<img width=\"883\" alt=\"TestResult\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/471021/65680904-36a46c80-e058-11e9-81df-41084a245562.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2030/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
