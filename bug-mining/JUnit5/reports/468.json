Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThe method `ReflectionSupport.findNestedClasses` is not thread-safe because the underlying implementation uses a `static` field of type `HashSet` without any synchronization:\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/ed3d84d0db3807ae4065221c47d10448ea60e74b/junit-platform-commons/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/commons/util/ReflectionUtils.java#L133\r\n\r\nIt should probably use `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()` or similar. The question is also how much value this cache adds in the first place, but you probably had your reasons to introduce it.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nI cannot provide example code to show the non-thread-safety, because, as often with thread-safety issues, showcasing that something is not thread-safe is difficult.\r\nIn this particular case it can most likely result in arbitrary exceptions being thrown when two or more threads try to rehash the set at the same time.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.8.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2715/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
