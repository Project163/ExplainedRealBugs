Overview\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you could write something like this in Kotlin when working with JUnit Jupiter.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n        @TestFactory\r\n        fun `dynamic tests returned as Kotlin sequence`() = generateSequence(0) { it + 2 }\r\n                .map { dynamicTest(\"$it should be even\") { assertTrue(it % 2 == 0) } }\r\n                .take(10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently you have to add `.toIterable()` as an extra line to make it work with JUnit Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe Kotlin `Sequence` class is an example of an iterator providing class, but it is not an `Iterable`. That's why it does not work as return type for `@TestFactory` methods at the moment.\r\n\r\nA benefit of adding this at this low level is that, Kotlin Sequences, or any other `Iterator` or `Spliterator` providing class can now also be used in other JUnit Jupiter methods where an object from an annotated method needs to be converted to a stream.\r\n\r\nI have an implementation for it ready. see:\r\n\r\n[Suggestion](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/3377/commits)\r\n\r\nAll tests still pass.\r\n\r\nI would like to contribute to JUnit 5 and make a pull request for this branch, but I don't have push permission yet for a feature branch in the JUnit 5 project.\r\n\r\nCould you please be so kind to take a look at the suggestion I provided? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance! I'm awaiting your response :)\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [X] Adding support for converting iterator providing classes to a stream in `org.junit.platform.commons.util.CollectionUtils`.\r\n- [X] Adding support for converting `Spliterator` providing classes to a stream in `org.junit.platform.commons.util.CollectionUtils`.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3376/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
