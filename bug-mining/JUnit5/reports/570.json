working on a `TempDirFactory` implementation based on my own memory file system implementation over at [marschall/memoryfilesystem-junit-provider](https://github.com/marschall/memoryfilesystem-junit-provider/). One of the features I would like to offer is configuration, allowing the user more control over the kind of file system they get (Windows, Unix, macOS, …). I imagine this configuration to be done through additional annotations on the element annotated with `@TempDir`, something like this\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@TempDir(factory = MemoryFileSystemTempDirFactory.class)\r\n@MemoryTempDirType(WINDOWS)\r\nPath tempDirectory;\r\n```\r\n\r\n(this can me made more compact with the help of meta-annotations)\r\n\r\nFor this to work, the `TempDirFactory` implementation needs access to this annotated element. Unfortunately `TempDirFactory` is only passed an `ExtensionContext` which only gives access to the test, not the element (method or field) annotated with `@TempDir`. What is needed is something like `ParameterContext` in `ParameterResolver`.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] extend `TempDirFactory` API to give access to annotated _source_ element\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
