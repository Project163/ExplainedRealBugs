Marc Philipp implemented the `@TempDir` extension in Pioneer, it was later also added to Jupiter. It didn't (and as of September 2020 doesn't) support custom file systems, but other than that is more feature-rich than Pioneer's variant. This creates an unpleasant situation where there are two extensions that solve the same problem with the same approach, but slightly different feature sets (and an identical name to boot).\r\n\r\nThat said, there are a lot of feature requests for Jupiter's variant (⚠️ _some of these are already implemented!_ ⚠️):\r\n\r\n* [Multiple declarations of `@TempDir` in same parameter list or class declaration should fail](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2219)\r\n* [Support @TempDir on constructor parameters](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1754)\r\n* [Introduce cleanup mode in @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1814)\r\n* [Multiple @TempDirs should result in multiple directories](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1967)\r\n* [Provide support for setting a custom parent directory for @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2088)\r\n* [Support disabling cleanup for @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2159)\r\n* [Support custom file system for `@TempDir`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2400)\r\n* [Make `@TempDir` restore mint permissions before closing context to avoid `AccessDeniedException`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2609)\r\n\r\nAfter evaluating the situation in #277, we decided to remove the extension before the 1.0 release with the goal to look for a better solution to the problem in the future (i.e. this issue). So the task is to come up with a temporary directory (or, more generally temporary resource) extension that covers _more_ than what Jupiter does, possibly with an approach that makes different trade-offs (so users of Jupiter and Pioneer have more choices to solve their specific problem).\r\n\r\nOne interesting proof of concept to look at is @sormuras': [1](https://github.com/sormuras/brahms#temporary-directory-as-resource),

introducing the ability to change where our `TemporaryDirectory` writes its temporary directories to. Currently it writes all directories to the filesystem path in the `java.io.tmpdir` system property. Users can adjust the property [in their build tool](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2088#issuecomment-574049472) or [directly in their tests](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2088#issuecomment-548325159), but the build tool approach isn't the most flexible, and the direct approach wouldn't allow the affected tests to run in parallel, I'd imagine.\r\n\r\njunit-pioneer used to have a `TempDirectory` class with this ability, but it was removed because the built-in JUnit 5 `TempDir` was superior in almost every way.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a follow-up to https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/348 | https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/pull/491.\r\n\r\nRelevant JUnit 5 issues:\r\n- https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2088\r\n\r\nDocs for the old `TempDirectory` extension: https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/blob/1415785e909f82066df2bd2b5ccfa10396aab0a0/docs/temp-directory.adoc","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1021628038","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2088#issuecomment-1021628038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2088","id":1021628038,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH8485M6G","user":{"login":"bes1002t","id":3890580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTA1ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3890580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t","html_url":"https://github.com/bes1002t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bes1002t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-25T21:31:36Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T21:31:36Z","body":"in my case junit always set it tempDir to the working directory of the project.
