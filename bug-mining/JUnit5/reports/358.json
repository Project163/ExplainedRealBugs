if any of the dependencies or transitive dependencies wishes to add a `TestExecutionListener`, it can do so by adding `org.junit.platform.launcher.TestExecutionListener` in `META-INF/services`.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes, we need a dependency for the features it provides, but we do not want its `TestExecutionListener` to get registered.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to have a similar construct like that of `junit.jupiter.conditions.deactivate` to be able to provide a pattern to disable or I suppose in this context de-register the
