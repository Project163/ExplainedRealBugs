have several test classes, each with multiple test methods inside. Some of those classes are injected with a parameter, and when running classes in parallel those classes should not run parallel. If I understand correctly, the `@ResourceLock` annotation can help here, but it would be very inconvenient to manually add that annotation to hundereds of tests. Ideally a extension could take a look at the class, see that it has this parameter and somehow add the ExclusiveResource to it.\r\n\r\nMy JUnit execution parameters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-Djunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true\r\n-Djunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=same_thread\r\n-Djunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default=concurrent\r\n-Djunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed\r\n-Djunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=8\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2677/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
