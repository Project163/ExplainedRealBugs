tried to use the new `@Timeout` annotation introduced in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/1885 to enforce a global timeout. I put it on the base class that all our JUnit Jupiter integration tests extend from. \r\n\r\nIt works, but unfortunately without any kind of \"DisableOnDebug\" feature we cannot realistically use it. When debugging a test and stepping through with a debugger it will fail early with the timeout.\r\n\r\nIf adding a global \"DisableOnDebug\" is not being considered, I think it would be a small fix to `org.junit.jupiter.engine.extension.TimeoutExtension` itself.\r\n\r\nJust need to add something like this (copied from JUnit 4's `DisableOnDebug`) to `TimeoutExtension` and not apply the timeout if `isDebugging()` is `true`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate static boolean isDebugging() {\r\n    List<String> inputArguments = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getInputArguments();\r\n    Iterator<String> iterator = inputArguments.iterator();\r\n    String argument;\r\n    do {\r\n        if (!iterator.hasNext()) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        argument = iterator.next();\r\n        if (\"-Xdebug\".equals(argument)) {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    } while (!argument.startsWith(\"-agentlib:jdwp\"));\r\n\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1959/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1959/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
