Overview\r\n\r\nI have felt that since joining the Kotlin Slack community I have been able to absorb the language from maintainers and the community much faster than by trying to locate these resources myself.\r\nI believe that having an active group like this will benefit extension authors, engine developers, test writers, and other consumers of JUnit.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the the JUnit 5 team adopt a Slack/Gitter for both the community and maintainers to gather around.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] A ~~Slack~~/**Gitter**/~~other~~ chat platform\r\n- [x] README
