team, I noticed that tests were not executed anymore in older surefire versions (i.e. 2.22.2-3.0.0-M3), when upgrading to 5.12.0-M1.\n\nFor surefire 2.22.2 and 3.0.0-M3 we get this warning message, but in 3.0.0-M1 and 3.0.0-M2 the tests are silently ignored:\n```\nWARNING: TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests\norg.junit.platform.commons.JUnitException: OutputDirectoryProvider not available; probably due to unaligned versions of the junit-platform-engine and junit-platform-launcher jars on the classpath/module path.\n```\n\nWas this an intentional change / does JUnit 5.12.0 drop support for those surefire versions?  \n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nRun `./mvnw clean test` in the reproducer. For 5.11.4 the build fails, but for 5.12.0-M1 the build succeeds, because no tests are executed:\n\n[reproducer.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18671741/reproducer.zip)\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
