Overview\r\n\r\nFixes #2547.\r\n\r\nA \"regression\" in the context of this issue (compared with the current situation) would be if importing API Guardian suddenly became required, as that would break existing systems. To guard against such a regression, I modified the `verifyOSGi` task so that it excludes the API Guardian jar/bundle from consideration by the resolver. Thus the test will prove that API Guardian is not required for resolving JUnit 5 bundles.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License
