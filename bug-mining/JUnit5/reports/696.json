#4131, the `AnnotationSupport.findAnnotation(Class, Class, SearchOption)` method was deprecated in favor of the new `AnnotationSupport.findAnnotation(Class, Class, List)` method. When called with `SearchOption.INCLUDE_ENCLOSING_CLASSES` it looks up annotations on the passed class or its _static_ enclosed types. In the context of `@Nested` tests that was not correct, as annotations (such as `@DisplayNameGeneration`) need to be looked up on the _runtime_ enclosing types which differ in case a `@Nested` class is declared in a superclass of the test class.\n\nIn order to call the new method, `ExtensionContext` should provide a `getEnclosingTestClasses(): List<Class<?>>` method that can be passed like this:\n\n```java\nAnnotationSupport.findAnnotation(\n    extensionContext.getRequiredTestClass(),\n    MyAnnotation.class,\n    extensionContext.getEnclosingTestClasses()\n);\n```\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Introduce `ExtensionContext.getEnclosingTestClasses()` method\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4375/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
