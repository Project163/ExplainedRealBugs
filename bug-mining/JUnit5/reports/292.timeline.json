 I noticed that in my tests the @After methods were not executed in the case of test timeouts. However, that only happens when the Timeout rule is used. For example, the following test is fine (in the sense After method is called as expected):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CheckTimeoutProblem {\r\n    @Before\r\n    public void before(){ System.out.println(\"Called @Before\");}\r\n\r\n    @After\r\n    public void after(){System.out.println(\"Called @After\");}\r\n\r\n    @Test(timeout = 10)\r\n    public void doFailWithTimeout(){\r\n        while(true){ int x = 0; x++;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void emptyTest(){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen running this, I get:\r\n\r\nCalled @Before\r\nCalled @After\r\nCalled @Before\r\nCalled @After\r\n\r\nwhich is as expected. However, if I use Timeout Rule like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CheckTimeoutProblem {\r\n    @Rule\r\n    public org.junit.rules.Timeout globalTimeout = new org.junit.rules.Timeout(200);\r\n\r\n    @Before\r\n    public void before(){ System.out.println(\"Called @Before\");}\r\n\r\n    @After\r\n    public void after(){System.out.println(\"Called @After\");}\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void doFailWithTimeout(){\r\n        while(true){ int x = 0; x++;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n   @Test\r\n    public void emptyTest(){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalled @Before\r\nCalled @After\r\nCalled @Before\r\n\r\nwhere the After of the timed out test is not executed :(

request**\r\nWe have a large number of end-to-end automation tests that have a dependency on an external resource (e.g. network calls, actual db, etc). There have been times that a test run will get caught up waiting for db locks, etc. In JUnit 4 we solve these problems by using the Timeout rule on a base class that our automation test classes extends. I don't see any way to replicate that behavior in JUnit 5, though.\r\n\r\nAccording to the following comment it sounds like the only current solution is to use the assertions that have a timeout, but this only works for a timeout of the assertion itself, not for other parts of the test method (e.g. during setup).\r\n\r\n[#343](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/343#issuecomment-238154229)\r\n\r\n**Deliverable**\r\nHave a way of preemptively terminating an executing test at any point in it's lifecycle.\r\n\r\n**P.S.**\r\nI suppose if we had control of the thread executing the tests at an appropriate time (so that the time countdown doesn't include time waiting for the test to actually start executing) as per this issue we could solve this with an extension similarly to how the timeout rule works, but I'm unsure of how much control the actual implementation of this issue will give extension authors.\r\n\r\n[#20](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/20)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/367250315","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/80#issuecomment-367250315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/80","id":367250315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzI1MDMxNQ==","user":{"login":"deepakab03","id":1521187,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjExODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1521187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03","html_url":"https://github.com/deepakab03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deepakab03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-21T08:34:49Z","updated_at":"2018-02-21T08:35:48Z","body":"In JUnit 4, if a Test super class specifies a Timeout Rule, then any Test subclass automatically inherits that and it becomes a kind of global timeout - as long as the Test super class is extended of course.

this is a good step, a real timeout would be great, since it would, for example, prevent hanging tests from hanging on the build servers, etc. - which is why we used a timeout rule in Junit4 for all tests, just to make sure they would never hang and block a resource there.\r\n\r\nSurrounding all test code with assertTimeoutPreemptively is, as everyone hopefully agrees, not really a good solution. Honestly, it's not even a good solution for one method, since it's clunky. An extension and annotation would be cleaner. Currently, this is the thing that worries me most for switching from JUnit4 to 5 (since we had multiple situations - for various reasons - in the past where tests did not finish properly... We could prevent that with the Timeout rule, but now...?).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/391313036/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FlorianSchaetz","id":11808528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODA4NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11808528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianSchaetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianSchaetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1641592726,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTY0MTU5MjcyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1641592726","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-23T11:54:33Z","milestone":{"title":"5.x
