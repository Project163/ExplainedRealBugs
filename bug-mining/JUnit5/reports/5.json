Test Class Naming\n\nI think we need a naming convention for our test classes. At the moment we have test classes that end with `Test`, `Tests`, and `TestCase`. Personally, I would prefer one of the first two variants.\n### Assertions\n\nIn addition, we should agree on how to write assertions. At the moment we have tests that use JUnit 4's `Assert`, some use our new `Assertions` class, others use AssertJ's `Assertions`. Since we plan to migrate our tests to use JUnit 5 at some point, I would propose that we do not use anything in JUnit 4, particularly not `org.junit.Assert`. Instead, I think, we should use our own `Assertions` were feasible and AssertJ, where we need its power.\n### Test Doubles\n\nWe had a brief discussion on Skype regarding a mocking framework. I've added Mockito to the test classpath and used it in a couple of tests. Other tests use hand-written stubs or spys. I think we can go with Mockito where easier and write doubles ourselves when we think it clearer.\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/66/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/66/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
