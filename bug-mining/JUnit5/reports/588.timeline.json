**Team decision:** Introduce attribute-less `@AutoClose` annotation that only works on fields of types that implement `java.lang.AutoCloseable` without any ordering guarantees for now.\r\n\r\nWe have decided to support a configurable close-method name which defaults to `close`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, due to the nature of our reflection utilities, we do in fact provide some guarantees regarding ordering, as I've outlined in the Javadoc for `@AutoClose`:\r\n\r\n> **Inheritance**\r\n> \r\n> `@AutoClose` fields are inherited from superclasses as long as they are not hidden. Furthermore, `@AutoClose` fields from subclasses will be closed before `@AutoClose` fields in superclasses.\r\n> \r\n> **Registration Order**\r\n> \r\n> When multiple `@AutoClose` fields exist within a given test class, the order in which the resources are closed depends on an algorithm that is deterministic but intentionally nonobvious. This ensures that subsequent runs of a test suite close resources in the same order, thereby allowing for repeatable builds.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1872982469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11362158112,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAbwRH85pk6YszwAAAAKlPMYg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/11362158112","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"be6ae2b19086358fe08d02426d9e6f0f45caf1fe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sbrannen/junit-framework/commits/be6ae2b19086358fe08d02426d9e6f0f45caf1fe","created_at":"2023-12-31T16:43:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11362161584,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAbwRH85pk6YszwAAAAKlPNOw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/11362161584","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a00eed865a9ebc5a6997d67ead2666c958f367b7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sbrannen/junit-framework/commits/a00eed865a9ebc5a6997d67ead2666c958f367b7","created_at":"2023-12-31T16:46:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11362171219,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAbwRH85pk6YszwAAAAKlPPlT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/11362171219","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":
