see you've moved the versions to dependency constraints (which I think is nice), however, it looks like there's no point in having `Versions` in `buildSrc`.\r\n\r\nThe problems with `Versions` object are:\r\n1) Every time `Versions` is updated the whole thing is rebuilt\r\n2) The only option to try a new version is to edit the build scripts.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think if the versions are moved to `gradle.properties` instead?\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\ngradle.properties:\r\n```properties\r\napiguardian-api.version=1.1.0\r\npicocli.version=4.2.0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen dependency constraints can be created as follows:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval String.v: String get() = rootProject.extra[\"$this.version\"] as String\r\n\r\nfun DependencyConstraintHandlerScope.apiv(\r\n    notation: String,\r\n    versionProp: String = notation.substringAfterLast(':')\r\n) =\r\n    \"api\"(notation + \":\" + versionProp.v)\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n    (constraints) {\r\n        apiv(\"org.apiguardian:apiguardian-api\")\r\n        apiv(\"info.picocli:picocli\")\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would\r\n1) Consolidate the versions in `gradle.properties`\r\n2) Enable testing with newer versions via `-Ppicocli.version=5.0.0`\r\n3) Avoid recompilation when `Versions` is updated","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
