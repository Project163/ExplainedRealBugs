so this may sound weird but I actually do have a need for a hook that is invoked prior to test instances being created (before the test instance factory or the default machinery actually creates the test instance). This would be a symmetric counterpart to the TestInstancePreDestroyCallback extension, which seems to be missing now.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that I have a custom parameter resolver which takes into account the context of when it's injected. So, essentially, it'd change value when it's injected during:\r\n\r\n- class initialization level (static initializer) and beforeall hooks\r\n- before instance constructor (or factory),\r\n- beforeeach hooks\r\n- test methods\r\n- aftereach hooks\r\n- afterall hooks\r\n\r\nI can intercept nearly all of the above using JUnit5 extensions except for the moment prior to when new instances are created (constructor call).\r\n\r\nA longer explanation is that I'm looking at moving the randomizedtesting framework (https://github.com/randomizedtesting/randomizedtesting) to JUnit5. I desperately try to avoid writing a custom test engine (so that I don't have to reimplement all of jupiter's extensions, etc.) but some of the new infrastructure doesn't cover the required needs. The parameter resolver above injects the randomization seed and this should be hierarchical. \r\n\r\nI peeked at the code and it seems like this should be fairly easy to implement in ClassBasedTestDescriptor - much like the current  pre-destroy callback is implemented (or the instance post-processor). Would this be something you consider acceptable if I provided a patch?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2733/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
