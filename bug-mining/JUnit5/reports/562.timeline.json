have confirmed that disabled events are not supplied to a `TestWatcher` for `@TestTemplate` methods (e.g., `@RepeatedTest` and `@ParameterizedTest`, and I have changed the title of this issue to reflect that.\r\n\r\nThe following can be used to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass WatcherTests {\r\n\r\n\t@RegisterExtension\r\n\tExtension watcher = new TestWatcher()
