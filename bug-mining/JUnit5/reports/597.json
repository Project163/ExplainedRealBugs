The issue\r\n\r\nThere are three broken links in the [user guides](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/).\r\n\r\n| Section | Item | Cause |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| [2.16.3. Sources of Arguments](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources) | `ValueArgumentsProvider` link | It is referring to its Javadoc, but the class is private-package |\r\n| [2.16.3. Sources of Arguments](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources) | `CsvArgumentsProvider` link | It is referring to its Javadoc, but the class is private-package |\r\n| [2.16.4. Argument Conversion](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion) | `AnnotationBasedArgumentConverter` link | It is referring to the `provider` package, but the correct is the `converter` one |\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Click on the \"section\" link from the table above\r\n2. Find the mentioned _Item_ link\r\n3. Click on it\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nAs the `ValueArgumentsProvider` and the `CsvArgumentsProvider` classes are `package-private`, not being generated by the JavaDoc the solution is to redirect the reader to its source code.\r\n\r\nFor the `AnnotationBasedArgumentConverter` link, only the package change is sufficient.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
