Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest(name=\"{0,number}\")\r\n@ValueSource(ints = {1, 2, 3})\r\nvoid someTest(int testInt) {\r\n    assertTrue(testInt > 0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in the following error during test discovery:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.junit.platform.commons.JUnitException: The display name pattern defined for the parameterized test is invalid. See nested exception for further details.\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTestNameFormatter.formatSafely(ParameterizedTestNameFormatter.java:76)\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot format given Object as a Number\r\n\tat java.text.DecimalFormat.format(DecimalFormat.java:507)\r\n\tat java.text.Format.format(Format.java:157)\r\n\tat java.text.MessageFormat.subformat(MessageFormat.java:1322)\r\n\tat java.text.MessageFormat.format(MessageFormat.java:865)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because `ParameterizedTestNameFormatter.format()` transforms all arguments into strings before invoking the `MessageFormat.format()` method. The `DecimalFormatter` however only works with numbers.\r\n\r\nBeing able to use the full range of `MessageFormat` would be useful to pad the parameter names. Also the javadoc for `ParameterizedTest.name` sounds to me, as if this functionality is supposed to be supported.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.3.2\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: N/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1714/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
