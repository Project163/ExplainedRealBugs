Overview\r\n\r\nAs a follow up to #2837, we have decided to ensure that users do not declare `@TempDir` fields as `final`.\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved analogous to our field type check in `TempDirectory.assertSupportedType(...)` -- for example, by throwing an `ExtensionConfigurationException` with a descriptive error message instead of allowing the JVM to throw an `IllegalAccessException` for a `static final` `@TempDir` field.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Assert that `@TempDir` fields are not `final` and fail the corresponding
