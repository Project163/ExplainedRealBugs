Overview\r\n\r\nThe `ExtensionContext.Store` currently provides convenience methods such as `getOrComputeIfAbsent(...)` for getting a value or storing one if no such value is currently present in the store; however, there is no such convenience method for when you do _not_ want to store the value.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are storing a `Boolean` value in the `Store` under a given `key`, an attempt to retrieve it via `store.get(key)` may return `null` or a `Boolean` value. In such situations, it is often desirable to default to `false` if the value is not present in the `Store`. With the status quo, however, you have to implement this as follows.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBoolean flag = store.get(key, Boolean.class);\r\nflag = (flag != null && flag);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be much more convenient to do the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nboolean flag = store.getOrElse(key, boolean.class, false);\r\n// Non-null check is no longer necessary\r\n// flag = (flag != null && flag);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposed `getOrElse(...)` method is analogous to the `getOrDefault(...)` method in `java.util.Map`.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce `getOrElse()` in `ExtensionContext.Store.`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
