`JUnitPlatform` is used through build tools such as Gradle or Bamboo, using display names for test and container descriptors causes them to be shown in the default package. To provide a good interim solution, f7b93a3f2818494048b741dbbf4b10ff2e02557a changed the names in `Description` objects for test descriptors to use class and method names.\n## Deliverables\n- [x] Introduce new annotation `@UseTechnicalNames` to enable this behavior. When the annotation is not present, display names will be used (as before).\n- [x] Use class name for suite descriptions, too, if `@UseTechnicalNames` is present.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
