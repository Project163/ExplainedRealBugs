the implementation of #2016 we could see that crucial information regarding conditional test execution was missing within the documentation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the information is present in the

`ExecutionCondition` extensions are registered, a container or test is\r\ndisabled as soon as one of the conditions returns _disabled_. Thus, there is no guarantee\r\nthat a condition is evaluated because another extension might have already caused a\r\ncontainer or test to be disabled. In other words, the evaluation works like the\r\nshort-circuiting boolean OR operator. \r\n\r\n... this kind of information is missing within the [Writing Tests](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/documentation/src/docs/asciidoc/user-guide/writing-tests.adoc#L334) section, which can lead to confusion when people start using multiple `ExecutionCondition`s.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Update User Guide to present or link crucial information\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2076/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2076/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
