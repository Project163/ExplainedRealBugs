Overview\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR VintageTestDescriptor was always using displayName\r\nfor legacy reporting purposes. As a result of #1475 displayName for\r\nvintage tests was updated to be the simple class name which in turn\r\naffected test reports that are based on legacy reporting name.\r\nThis PR updates VintageTestDescriptor to use fully-qualified class name\r\nfor legacy reporting if that is available.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nRunning following vintage tests\r\norg.example.third.TestClassOneTest, org.example.second.TestClassOneTest, org.example.first.TestClassOneTest\r\n\r\nstarted to produce the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- maven-surefire-plugin:2.22.1:test (default-test) @
