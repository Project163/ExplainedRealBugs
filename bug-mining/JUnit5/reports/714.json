have some comments regarding configuring tests for parallel execution following reading: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/index.html#writing-tests-parallel-execution\n\nIdentifying all the relevant properties and the defaults for the properties in `junit-platform.properties` needs to be more obvious. They can be deduced from the narrative but perhaps should just be stated explicitly.\n\nAlso, a gentle approach for enabling parallelism should be suggested along with suggested mitigations when things don't work, as a sequence of steps that projects can evolve upon while still getting some parallelization benefit. An example for the `Execution` annotation would be useful as well. Non-parallel test execution could be considered a form of technical debt and a suggested approach for whittling away at that debt to make incremental progress towards as-parallel-as-practical execution. ie. help people figure out where they are now and what their next step should be along with necessary validation checks for each step.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Add table of relevant configuration parameters\n- [x] Add example for using the `@Execution` annotation","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2669/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2669/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
