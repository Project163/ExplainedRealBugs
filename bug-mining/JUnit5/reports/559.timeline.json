Good point on the error message, I can still imagine developers unaware of the caching would be confused about why two of the seemingly same primitive values result in different references in that case, which could mislead them into thinking their implementation is wrong and a lot of time wasted in debugging.\r\n\r\nIn the end it comes down to whether JUnit users would expect `assertSame` to have overloaded variants, as you mentioned. Personally, I couldn't think of any case where a developer would on purpose write code using primitive values where they would make use of the fact that 127 always references the same object, while 128 doesn't.

It does not check equality, and in Java it is important to understand the difference between identity and equality.\r\n\r\nFor equality, we have `assertEquals(int, int)`, and `assertEquals(128, 128)` passes.\r\n\r\nIf we do decide to introduce primitive type overloads for `assertSame()`, each of those overloads would simply delegate to the corresponding `assertEquals()` method, which seems a bit unnecessary to me.

`assertSame()` is only intended to check object reference identity. It does not check equality, and in Java it is important to understand the difference between identity and equality.\r\n\r\nAgreed. The `==` operator in Java is often associated with checking for identity and you typically also use it to check for equality between primitive data types. Given `equals` is exclusively used for checking the equality of two objects and `==` is typically used to compare identity, I think it's not unexpected for developers who start learning JUnit intuitively to start associating `equals` with `assertEquals` and `==` with `assertSame` and to always use them as such, even though this technically means you would be using the API wrong, as you were pointing out. Then, as `127 == 127` is `true`, just like `128 == 128` is, I don't think it's too far off to expect `assertSame` to work in the same way.\r\n\r\n> `assertSame` is not intended to be used with primitive types. Can you use `assertEquals` instead?\r\n\r\nIn most cases I would say yes, unless you want to verify a primitive datatype is used, as `assertEquals` will still pass in case of `assertEquals(new Integer(128), new Integer(128))` for example, which is why I tended to use `assertSame` in those cases in the past.\r\n\r\n> Team decision: Document that `assertSame` should not be used with primitive types.\r\n\r\nThis was one approach I was thinking of as well. One option to take it further could be to throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if `assertSame` is attempted to be used with primitive data types to make sure it is not used in the wrong way.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1594588696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"martinfrancois","id":14319020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14319020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois","html_url":"https://github.com/martinfrancois","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinfrancois/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1594617705","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3358#issuecomment-1594617705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3358","id":1594617705,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH85fC-9p","user":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-16T12:42:51Z","updated_at":"2023-06-16T12:42:51Z","body":">
