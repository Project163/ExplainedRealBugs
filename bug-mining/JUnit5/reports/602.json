Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven a suite with some configuration:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Suite\r\n@ConfigurationParameter(key = Constants.DEFAULT_TEST_INSTANCE_LIFECYCLE_PROPERTY_NAME, value = \"per_class\")\r\n@SelectClasses(ExampleTest.class)\r\npublic class SuiteTest {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a test that is sensitive to that configuration\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ExampleTest {\r\n\r\n    boolean shared = false;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void test1(){\r\n        if(!shared) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Hello world 1\");\r\n        } else {\r\n            System.out.println(\"World was already greeted\");\r\n        }\r\n        shared = true;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void test2(){\r\n        if(!shared) {\r\n            System.out.println(\"Hello world 2\");\r\n        } else {\r\n            System.out.println(\"World was already greeted\");\r\n        }\r\n        shared = true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen executing the tests either by their uniqueId or the `SuiteTest` class should not make a difference in execution:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class TestRunner {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"By suite\");\r\n\r\n        LauncherDiscoveryRequest requestA = request()\r\n                .selectors(\r\n                        DiscoverySelectors.selectClass(SuiteTest.class)\r\n                )\r\n                .build();\r\n\r\n        LauncherFactory.create().execute(requestA);\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(\"By unique id\");\r\n\r\n        LauncherDiscoveryRequest requestB = request()\r\n                .selectors(\r\n                        DiscoverySelectors.selectUniqueId(\r\n                                UniqueId.forEngine(\"junit-platform-suite\")\r\n                                        .append(\"suite\", \"com.example.SuiteTest\")\r\n                                        .appendEngine(\"junit-jupiter\")\r\n                                        .append(\"class\", \"com.example.ExampleTest\" )\r\n                                        .append(\"method\", \"test1()\")\r\n                        ),\r\n                        DiscoverySelectors.selectUniqueId(\r\n                                UniqueId.forEngine(\"junit-platform-suite\")\r\n                                        .append(\"suite\", \"com.example.SuiteTest\")\r\n                                        .appendEngine(\"junit-jupiter\")\r\n                                        .append(\"class\", \"com.example.ExampleTest\" )\r\n                                        .append(\"method\", \"test2()\")\r\n                        )\r\n                )\r\n                .build();\r\n\r\n        LauncherFactory.create().execute(requestB);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when executed we see that this is the case.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBy suite\r\nHello world 1\r\nWorld was already greeted\r\n\r\nBy unique id\r\nHello world 1\r\nHello world 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - JUnit 5.10.1.\r\n\r\nThe above example is somewhat contrived for the sake of reproducibility. The actual problems showed up when using Surefire to rerun Cucumber tests in a Suite. Surefire uses unique ids to rerun failures and Cucumber Suites tend to come with more configuration than JUnit.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
