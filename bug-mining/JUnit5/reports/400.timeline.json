I have a use case from https://github.com/osgi/osgi-test.\r\n> \r\n> We have an extension for bundle context, an extension for services which uses the bundle context extension, and another extension for configuration which uses the previous 2 extensions. So we use CloseableResources to clean up the resources consumed by each extension. But we end up with the CloseableResource for bundle context closed before the CloseableResource for services. It would be much cleaner and correct for the other order.\r\n> \r\n> So ordering the CloseableResources in inverse insertion order would be most helpful for us.\r\n> \r\n> An alternate would be to use the [`@Order` annotation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Order.html) on the implementation of the `CloseableResource.close()` method to allow the implementor to influence the close order.\r\n\r\nI think that guaranteeing cleanup in the reverse insertion order is the most sustainable solution here. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the `@Order` annotation approach is that it requires a \"global\" view of all the extensions/closeable resources involved and an understanding of their interdependencies so that you can set an order that makes sense for all of the components. This can work when the number of extensions is small and you have direct control over them (as is the case at the moment for osgi-test), but what happens if/when third parties start writing their own extensions that depend on ours? We could end up pushing responsibility for maintaining the correct `@Order` annotations onto the extension users.\r\n\r\nI think of build systems - it has been a long time since build systems were specified as a linear list of build steps. For the most part now, they work by defining more-or-less-atomic build steps, each of which specifies its dependencies on other build steps (if any) - then letting the build system use this information to determine an appropriate build order. Bundle resolution in OSGi follows a similar pattern for the most part. \r\n\r\nCleaning up in reverse insertion order is a pretty neat way of solving any inter-dependency issues for most cases in a transparent way.\r\n\r\nAnother way I could see to do it would be to define a `@DependsOn` annotation that you can use to annotate extensions to explicitly declare their dependencies. We could even co-opt `@ExtendsWith`/`@RegisterExtension` for this purpose.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/675786127/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/677832507","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2211#issuecomment-677832507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2211","id":677832507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzgzMjUwNw==","user":{"login":"bjhargrave","id":277682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzY4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave","html_url":"https://github.com/bjhargrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-20T18:40:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T18:40:22Z","body":"> The problem with the `@Order` annotation approach is that it requires a \"global\" view of all the extensions/closeable resources involved and an understanding of their interdependencies so that you can set an order that makes sense for all of the components.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is entirely true. You don't really need to establish a total ordering over all CloseableResources in an ExecutionContext's Store. You only need to establish some orderings between some interdependent CloseableResources. \r\n\r\nFor the OSGi crowd, this is like Start Levels. You don't need to define a total ordering of every bundle for the purposes of starting the bundles but you sometimes need to make sure bundle B start after Bundle A, so you need to establish a start level for Bundle B that is higher than that of Bundle A (which may just be the default start level). \r\n\r\nIn the specific use case I mention above, if, by default, all CloseableResources have an order of `Order.DEFAULT`, then to solve my ordering problem, I just need to set the order of the service extension's CloseableResource.close() method to `@Order(Order.DEFAULT-1)` to ensure it is invoked before the bundle context extension's CloseableResource.close() method. The ordering of other CloseableResources is not really important in this use case as they do not have any inter-dependencies.\r\n\r\nBut I think that inverse insertion order would be fine for my use case because I can ensure the bundle context extension's CloseableResource is inserted in the Store before the service extension's CloseableResource.\r\n\r\nBut I can imagine it is not always possible that one can control the insertion order to get the desired close order. (An extension might lazily insert a CloseableResource into the Store.) And so using `Order` annotations can provide control back to the developer of a given CloseableResource.\r\n\r\n> Another way I could see to do it would be to define a `@DependsOn` annotation that you can use to annotate extensions to explicitly declare their dependencies. We could even co-opt `@ExtendsWith`/`@RegisterExtension` for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThis is also an interesting idea and probably a better declarative way of expressing dependencies between extensions that could apply to much more then CloseableResource invocation order. (Although I am not sure, in the current implementation, the Store knows which extension is inserting a CloseableResource so that it can control their close invocation order. So more context would need to be captured for this level of knowledge.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/677832507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bjhargrave","id":277682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzY4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave","html_url":"https://github.com/bjhargrave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjhargrave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3676855285,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM2NzY4NTUyODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/3676855285","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"609ef0a1aa0cc60572af1aa8dc679744cea3bf9a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/commits/609ef0a1aa0cc60572af1aa8dc679744cea3bf9a","created_at":"2020-08-20T19:48:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3676894703,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MzY3Njg5NDcwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/3676894703","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-20T20:00:19Z","milestone":{"title":"5.8
