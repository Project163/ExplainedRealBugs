I remember someone brought up this before, when the Timeout annotation being proposed: we have lots of legacy testing code in JUnit 4 relies on the timeout rules, which works in a preemptive way (from my own observation). I totally agree with you the behavior will hide some problems under the hood. But in some scenarios, the preemptive behavior is really helpful. For example we have an online Java education service, the students' submissions are totally unpredictable and we evaluate/grades the code heavily relying on the number of pass/fail unit tests. If there is some infinite running part in the code for one test case, we have no way to give a grade because the service is keep running forever. But that can be terminated in our JUnit 4 implementation with a timeout rule configuration. As we are migrating the system to JUnit 5, this becomes a headache for us. The current work around we do is enclosing every single unit test with the assertTimeoutPreemptively. And for the potential threads running in the background issue, because we run the services in a docker container, as long as all unit tests have a pass/fail result, the container will be shutdown. So that will not be an issue.\r\n\r\nI know the aforementioned scenario is a little bit special, but I do see someone else also have the similar requirements in their code base as we use JUNIT as a part of the business logic. The new Timeout annotation introduced in v5.5 is elegant and convenient to use except lacking the preemptive behavior we want. The workaround I am thinking about: is it possible to add some \"**switcher**\" to the annotation which may look like following:\r\n```java\r\n        @Test\r\n\t@Timeout(1, PREEMPTIVE=true) // run at most 1 seconds\r\n\tvoid pollUntil() {\r\n\t\tA a = new A();\r\n\t\ta.infinite();\r\n\t\tassertEquals(1,1);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nOr just introducing a new annotation like `@TimeoutPreemptive`?\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/548437267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"praenubilus","id":547418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzQxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/547418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus","html_url":"https://github.com/praenubilus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2760347078,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2MDM0NzA3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2760347078","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T15:42:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2760347082,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjAzNDcwODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2760347082","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T15:42:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2760808771,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50Mjc2MDgwODc3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2760808771","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"create

choice.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/548504574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"praenubilus","id":547418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzQxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/547418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus","html_url":"https://github.com/praenubilus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2760915231,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc2MDkxNTIzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2760915231","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T18:17:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2760915232,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjA5MTUyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2760915232","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T18:17:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/548714987","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2087#issuecomment-548714987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2087","id":548714987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODcxNDk4Nw==","user":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/user

using JUnit to grade coding exams. Students get points for each passing test, so it's important to me that failures from a single test are isolated - I don't want students' mistakes in one part of the code to affect other tests and cause them to lose more points than they should. Such mistakes sometimes include infinite loops in their code, meaning I need timeouts. And sometimes mistakes include printing text to stdout within an infinite loop...\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following test:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.*;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.*;\r\n\r\nclass Example {\r\n    @Test\r\n    @Timeout(value = 2, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS)\r\n    void test() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        while(true) System.out.println(\"Hello\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test hangs, despite the timeout.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): Jupiter\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Gradle\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu 18.04.3, using Gradle 6.0.1 (latest as of this report) and the following build.gradle:\r\n\r\n```\r\nplugins {\r\n    id 'java'\r\n}\r\n\r\nrepositories {\r\n    jcenter()\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n    // JUnit 5 \"Jupiter\"\r\n    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.5.2'\r\n    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.5.2'\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest {\r\n    useJUnitPlatform()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI run tests with `./gradlew build`.\r\n\r\nNote that replacing the `while(true)` loop above with `Thread.sleep(60 * 1000)` causes the test to fail with a `TimeoutException`, as expected.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make `@Timeout` work even when the test prints infinite output to stdout\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/573346859","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2087#issuecomment-573346859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2087","id":573346859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3MzM0Njg1OQ==","user":{"login":"kreimendahlf","id":14066811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDY2ODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14066811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf","html_url":"https://github.com/kreimendahlf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kreimendahlf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-11T19:25:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-11T19:25:38Z","body":"I

Actually that's what I proposed in October last year, but the team decides not to include it at that time.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/665785563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"praenubilus","id":547418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzQxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/547418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus","html_url":"https://github.com/praenubilus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/praenubilus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/665816337","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2087#issuecomment-665816337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2087","id":665816337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTgxNjMzNw==","user":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-29T18:06:17Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T18:06:17Z","body":"I'd be okay with making this configurable as long as the current behavior stays the default.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/665816337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
