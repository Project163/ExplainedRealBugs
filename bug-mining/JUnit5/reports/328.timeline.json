This will get really tricky in my opinion.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/536868869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aepfli","id":9987394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9987394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli","html_url":"https://github.com/aepfli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/536879827","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2016#issuecomment-536879827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2016","id":536879827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjg3OTgyNw==","user":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-01T06:00:23Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T06:00:23Z","body":"> Each of the conditional annotations listed in the following sections can only be declared once on a given test interface, test class, or test method.

Overview\r\n\r\nSupport for enabling or disabling a test on a range of JREs. Therfore we implemented two new annotations `@EnabledForJreRange` and `@DisabledForJreRange` which contain two parameters `min` (Defaults to `JRE.Java_8`)  and `max` (defaults to `JRE.OTHER`). By defaulting those to the highest and lowest version, we allow the usage of half open ranges.\r\n\r\nI might need to rework javadoc and documentation, i am not really good when it comes to wording those.\r\n\r\nResolves #2016.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/002a0052926ddee57cf90580fa49bc37e5a72427/CONTRIBUTING.md#junit-contributor-license-agreement).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Definition of Done\r\n\r\n- [x] There are no TODOs left in the code\r\n- [x] Method [preconditions](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/api/org/junit/platform/commons/util/Preconditions.html) are checked and documented in the method's Javadoc\r\n- [x] [Coding conventions](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-conventions) (e.g. for logging) have been followed\r\n- [x] Change is covered by [automated tests](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests) including corner cases, errors, and exception handling\r\n- [x] Public API has [Javadoc](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#javadoc) and [`@API` annotations](https://apiguardian-team.github.io/apiguardian/docs/current/api/org/apiguardian/api/API.html)\r\n- [x] Change is documented in the [User Guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/) and [Release Notes](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#release-notes)\r\n- [x] All [continuous integration builds](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5#continuous-integration-builds) pass\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2698556260,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI2OTg1NTYyNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2698556260","actor":{"login":"aepfli","id":9987394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9987394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli","html_url":"https://github.com/aepfli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aepfli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"82c14432bba9a08cc29a3f437014d3e8777a036c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aepfli/junit5/commits/82c14432bba9a08cc29a3f437014d3e8777a036c","created_at":"2019-10-09T10:50:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2705141270,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjcwNTE0MTI3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/2705141270","actor":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-11T07:04:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
