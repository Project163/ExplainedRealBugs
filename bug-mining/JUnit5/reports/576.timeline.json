1. `randomNumber0` is an Integer, so it's not injected.\r\n\r\nGood catch. I've fixed that locally and will push that soon.\r\n\r\n> 2. `findAnnotatedFields` is missing the fourth parameter, so it doesn't compile.\r\n\r\nThe example is in the documentation for JUnit 5.10, and `org.junit.platform.commons.support.AnnotationSupport.findAnnotatedFields(Class<?>, Class<? extends Annotation>, Predicate<Field>)` was introduced in JUnit Platform 1.10. So, the code compiles fine.\r\n\r\nPlease note that almost all demos in the User Guide are actually compiled as part of the but JUnit 5 build. See the `documentation` project for details.\r\n\r\n> 3. If `randomNumber0` is removed completely from `RandomNumberDemo`, then `randomNumber1` is not injected. \r\n\r\nI cannot reproduce that. Based my tests, `randomNumber1` is always injected.\r\n\r\nFor example, running the tests locally with the aforementioned fix in `isInteger()` and including the following `System.err` invocations...\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass RandomNumberDemo {\r\n\r\n\t// Use static randomNumber0 field anywhere in the test class,\r\n\t// including @BeforeAll or @AfterEach lifecycle methods.\r\n\t@Random\r\n\tprivate static Integer randomNumber0;\r\n\r\n\t// Use randomNumber1 field in test methods and @BeforeEach\r\n\t// or @AfterEach lifecycle methods.\r\n\t@Random\r\n\tprivate int randomNumber1;\r\n\r\n\tRandomNumberDemo(@Random int randomNumber2) {\r\n\t\t// Use randomNumber2 in constructor\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(\"randomNumber0: \" + randomNumber0);\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(\"randomNumber2: \" + randomNumber2);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@BeforeEach\r\n\tvoid beforeEach(@Random int randomNumber3) {\r\n\t\t// Use randomNumber3 in @BeforeEach method.\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(\"randomNumber3: \" + randomNumber3);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tvoid test(@Random int randomNumber4) {\r\n\t\t// Use randomNumber4 in test method.\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(\"randomNumber1: \" + randomNumber1);\r\n\t\tSystem.err.println(\"randomNumber4: \" + randomNumber4);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n... I consistently get output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrandomNumber0: -151750513\r\nrandomNumber2: 772767165\r\nrandomNumber3: 49014480\r\nrandomNumber1: 1229402178\r\nrandomNumber4:

Overview\r\n\r\nAs discovered by @graydavid in #3433, there is an issue regarding extension registration via `@ExtendWith` on instance fields.\r\n\r\nThe following is a simplification of the `RandomNumberDemo` from the User Guide which demonstrates the problem.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// @ExtendWith(RandomNumberExtension.class)\r\nclass RandomNumberDemoTest {\r\n\r\n\t@Random\r\n\tInteger randomNumber;\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tvoid test() {\r\n\t\tassertThat(this.randomNumber).isNotNull();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above test fails; however, if you annotate the test class with `@ExtendWith(RandomNumberExtension.class)` the test then passes.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `ClassBasedTestDescriptor#instantiateAndPostProcessTestInstance()` invokes `ExtensionUtils.registerExtensionsFromFields()` too late.\r\n\r\nI even added the following comment when I introduced that support.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// In addition, we register extensions from instance fields here since the\r\n// best time to do that is immediately following test class instantiation\r\n// and post processing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, that is not the \"best time to do that\" when a field is annotated (or meta-annotated in the case of `@Random`) with an `@ExtendWith` annotation that registers an extension that implements `TestInstancePostProcessor`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #3433\r\n- #3463\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Revise the usage of `ExtensionUtils.registerExtensionsFromFields()` so that a `TestInstancePostProcessor` can be registered via `@ExtendWith` on a non-static field.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1694668551","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3433#issuecomment-1694668551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3433","id":1694668551,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH85lApcH","user":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-27T13:23:41Z","updated_at":"2023-08-27T13:23:41Z","body":">
