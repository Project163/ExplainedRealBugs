Overview\r\n\r\nThis commit adds support for specifying a properties file, for use with configuration parameters.\r\n\r\n- Added a new field configurationParametersResources of type List<String> to store the configuration parameters resources.\r\n- Added new methods configurationParametersResource(String propertiesFile) and configurationParametersResources(List<String> propertiesFiles) to add configuration parameters resources to the request builder.\r\n- Updated the buildLauncherConfigurationParameters() method to include the configurationParametersResources in the Builder instance.\r\n\r\nRelated to issue: #3340\r\n\r\n## Open questions:\r\n\r\n- ~~The `@API` annotation values, what should they be?

@mpkorstanje,\r\n\r\n> Yes. Edited for clarity.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n> Do you think that there are use cases for file based configuration outside of this specific example? \r\n\r\nYes. Teams may have more than one \"test\" task in their build -- for example, one for unit tests and one for integration tests, etc.\r\n\r\nIn such scenarios, it is impossible to have multiple `junit-platform.properties` files for each \"test\" task. Having a way to specify custom properties files would address that shortcoming.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, with this feature one could still have a core `junit-platform.properties` file with additional suite-specific properties that override values in `junit-platform.properties`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/1582784874/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9473861128,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAbwRH85nzHOQzwAAAAI0r6YI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/9473861128","actor":{"login":"mpkorstanje","id":6946919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6946919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje","html_url":"https://github.com/mpkorstanje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-08T15:13:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9473861133,"node_id":"SE_lADOAbwRH85nzHOQzwAAAAI0r6YN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/9473861133","actor":{"login":"mpkorstanje","id":6946919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6946919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje","html_url":"https://github.com/mpkorstanje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-08T15:13:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9481789860,"node_id":"RTE_lADOAbwRH85nzHOQzwAAAAI1KKGk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/9481789860","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-09T08:25:37Z","rename":{"from":"Introduce
