only instances of `CloseableResource` that are stored in an `ExtensionContext.Store` are closed automatically when the `ExtensionContext` is closed. However, items stored in the session-/request-level stores only need to implement `AutoCloseable`. To address this confusing difference in behavior, we should introduce a configuration parameter that allows to treat `AutoCloseable` like `CloseableResource` in Jupiter's stores. It should be \"on\" by default in 5.13.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Introduce configuration parameter for enabling auto-closing `AutoCloseable` objects (`true` by default)\n- [x] Deprecate `CloseableResource`\n- ~Make `CloseableResource` extend `AutoCloseable` so existing implementations would keep working~ Doesn't work because `CloseableResource#close` is allowed to throw `Throwable`, not just `Exception`\n- [x] Log warning if an object is ~put into~ encountered while closing the `Store` that implements `CloseableResource` but not `AutoCloseable` (if the feature is on)\n- [x] Document migration path for external extensions (implement both `CloseableResource` and `AutoCloseable` should they need to support pre-5.13 versions)","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4434/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
