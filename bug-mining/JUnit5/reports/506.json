team,\r\n\r\nIn Spring Boot we [had the issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/30082) that some of our tests don't run on Linux when using an AArch64 architecture. I then added a [custom annotation](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/24a68fc5953f7de1c485b70692e65002782f4d70/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-test-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/testsupport/junit/DisabledOnOs.java) and the [condition](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/24a68fc5953f7de1c485b70692e65002782f4d70/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-test-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/testsupport/junit/DisabledOnOsCondition.java) to disable the tests on Linux AArch64. This could be something that JUnit Jupiter provides out of the box. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nAnother note: This could lead to making the annotations repeatable, as maybe a test doesn't work on Linux aarch64 and on MacOS x86, which you could not do without repeating the annotation.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Introduce `architecture` attribute in the `@EnabledOnOs` and `@DisabledOnOs` annotations.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
