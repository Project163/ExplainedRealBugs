Overview\r\n\r\nWith the adoption of a declarative suite mechanism in JUnit 5 proposed in #744, the annotations that were moved to the ```junit-platform-suite-api``` will be used more broadly than for test selection using the JUnit 4 ```JUnitPlatform``` runner.\r\n\r\n## Original Proposal\r\n\r\n- The javadocs for these annotations should be changed to describe their meaning without reference to this runner.\r\n- Make the javadocs for the ```junit-platform-suite-api``` annotations consistent with their expanded use.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\nConsider improving the JavaDoc for each of the following suite API annotations in order to better explain their _generic_ purpose vs. usage with the `JUnitPlatform` runner for JUnit 4.\r\n\r\n-  ExcludeClassNamePatterns\r\n-  ExcludeEngines\r\n-

thanks for creating the ticket!\r\n\r\nI think there are two main topics we need to sort out here:\r\n\r\n1. suites within the JUnit Jupiter engine\r\n2. declarative suite configuration at the Platform level\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, you are currently focusing on # 1; whereas, I would first like to focus on # 2.\r\n\r\n### Status Quo\r\n\r\n- We have generic suite API annotations.\r\n- We have a JUnit 4 based runner that supports them.\r\n\r\n### The Future\r\n\r\n- Ideally we should have Platform-level support for them as well.\r\n- If it makes sense to have additional support in JUnit Jupiter for \"suites\", we should consider that as well.\r\n\r\n### My Vision\r\n\r\nI think it would be most beneficial to the entire community if the JUnit Platform provides support for declarative test suites, akin to what the `JUnitPlatform` runner already does, but without any ties to _any_ testing framework.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the _declarative test suite support_ should be analogous to using the `ConsoleLauncher` or JUnit Platform Gradle plugin.\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved by moving the internals for processing such suite annotations and building the corresponding `LauncherDiscoveryRequest` from the `JUnitPlatform` runner to a new home in the launcher module. This new \"prediscovery\" code could then be used to transparently add selectors and filters to the request _before_ any engines are asked to _discover_. For example, this could potentially be performed in the `DefaultLauncher`.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, all test engines could benefit from being able to be configured by a generic suite (which is already supported in build scripts). From the perspective of a `TestEngine`, the presence of selectors and filters added from the suite declaration would be no different than those added via a build script.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/289029181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1014322711,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTAxNDMyMjcxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1014322711","actor":{"login":"smoyer64","id":328333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64","html_url":"https://github.com/smoyer64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-24T13:56:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1014322712,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwMTQzMjI3MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/1014322712","actor":{"login":"smoyer64","id":328333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64","html_url":"https://github.com/smoyer64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-24T13:56:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/289029745","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/744#issuecomment-289029745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/744","id":289029745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTAyOTc0NQ==","user":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-24T13:58:56

The engine I've already created works fine but with a couple more extension points it would be trivial to simply make it an extension.\r\n\r\nLet's ignore the word \"suite\" for a moment - I think there's a great argument that these are simply hierarchical test containers that participate in the engine's life-cycle at their appropriate level of the hierarchy.  And the ```junit-platform-suite-api``` annotations are simply a declarative specification describing what tests are contained within the container.\r\n\r\nI wrote this issue as asked in #681 because I thought you were promoting a built-in suite (which may be worthwhile) but the original two issues were simply to make it easier to write extensions that implement arbitrary containers.  Breaking the tie between ```junit-platform-suite-api``` and JUnit >=4.12 was definitely the right thing to do - perhaps this issue will be another meta-issue (like #14) that spawns a series of small steps towards the final goal.\r\n\r\nEDIT - It appears we're trying to have one of those conversations where we're both talking at the same time ;)  I also should have noted that the code blocks I put in the original description are indicative of what I'd like to write when creating suites.

I like the concept, but the linkage to the old names causes risk.\r\n\r\nAll of my work is consulting work in organizations. Frequently when I sit down with teams I get a chance to see their code. In too many cases I see people who have JUnit 3 style tests and suites in JUnit 4. When prompted they're not aware that this is no longer the preferred way. \r\n\r\nWhat I have loved about JUnit 5 is that by and large the right choices will be made by default. Re-using the suites word by default will make easier for people to accidentally mis-use them in world where people use their \"intelli-sense\" type technology, instead of reading the documentation and reflecting.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nMark aka @mlevison ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/289039216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mlevison","id":140902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDkwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison","html_url":"https://github.com/mlevison","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlevison/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
