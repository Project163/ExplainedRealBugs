Overview\r\n\r\nJUnit 5 user guide currently have tons of example test codes, and all the test classes are written in `class`.\r\n\r\nIt seems that we can write a test class with `record`, and there's no trouble with it.\r\n\r\nWell indeed there would be no reason for it not to work, it is simply a final class with private final members and the constructor and etc.\r\nActually I'd prefer to use `record` because of its neat look and convenience for doing constructor injection.\r\n\r\nIf it is officially possible without any side effects, i'd like to see the official section or any explanations mentioning `record` and the sample test codes in the user guide.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\nBelow is just a reference that deals with record-written test: it has nothing to do with this feature request.\r\n\r\n- #2575\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3892/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
