am currently writing a small extension which implements `ParameterResolver` to provide a few parameters which need to be shut down after the test. After reading the documentation, my first intuition was to write the extension like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal class MyExtension implements ParameterResolver {\r\n    private static final Namespace NAMESPACE = Namespace.create(MyExtension.class);\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean supportsParameter(ParameterContext parameterContext, ExtensionContext extensionContext) {\r\n        return parameterContext.getParameter().getType() == Parameter.class;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Object resolveParameter(ParameterContext parameterContext, ExtensionContext extensionContext) {\r\n        return extensionContext\r\n                .getStore(NAMESPACE)\r\n                .getOrComputeIfAbsent(ParameterWrapper.class)\r\n                .parameter;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static final class ParameterWrapper implements CloseableResource {\r\n        private final Parameter parameter;\r\n\r\n        private ParameterWrapper() {\r\n            this.parameter = new Parameter();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void close() {\r\n            parameter.close();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with that solution is that the `ExtensionContext` is scoped for the whole test class when resolving arguments for the test class constructor, although the test uses `TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_METHOD`. As a consequence, my example above will use the same parameter for all tests, instead of creating a new one per test. The documentation does not describe a lot of details about the lifecycle of each `ExtensionContext`, therefore I cannot declare it as a bug, but this behavior is very unexpected in my opinion. Since the callbacks are on the level of the individual tests, I expected the `ExtensionContext` to be scoped to the test as well. The same problem applies to `TestInstancePreConstructCallback`. I haven't tested `TestInstanceFactory`, but I guess it is also affected.\r\n\r\nThe obvious workaround is to also add a `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback` which closes the parameter and removes it from the store. Note that the implementation of that method is not trivial because in contrast to the methods above, this callback receives a child store which is scoped to the test. Unfortunately, this means that calling remove on the given store directly instead of iterating over the parents would not work.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void preDestroyTestInstance(ExtensionContext context) {\r\n        ParameterWrapper wrapper = null;\r\n        do {\r\n            wrapper = context.getStore(NAMESPACE).remove(ParameterWrapper.class, ParameterWrapper.class);\r\n            context = context.getParent().orElse(null);\r\n        } while (context != null && wrapper == null);\r\n        if (wrapper != null) wrapper.close();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Test-scoped `ExtensionContext` for `InvocationInterceptor.interceptTestClassConstructor(…)`\r\n- [ ] Test-scoped `ExtensionContext` for `ParameterResolver` while resolving constructor parameters\r\n- [ ] Test-scoped `ExtensionContext` for `TestInstancePreConstructCallback`\r\n- [ ] Test-scoped `ExtensionContext` for `TestInstancePostProcessor`\r\n- [ ] Test-scoped `ExtensionContext` for `TestInstanceFactory`\r\n- [ ] Consider #3670 in the implementation\r\n\r\n**-- or --**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation of the limitation in the Javadoc of the interfaces or callbacks.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\n- #3323\r\n- #3670","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
