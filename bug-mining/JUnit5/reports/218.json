Feature Request\r\n\r\nI am looking for a straightforward stable API for testing Extensions that would offer deep insights when meta-testing the Extension (think something similar to what is provided via the [SummaryGeneratingListener](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/junit-platform-launcher/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/launcher/listeners/SummaryGeneratingListener.java), but with finer grained information reported).\r\n\r\nContext here is that testing extensions via meta-testing (having a test that tests other test runs), I found it to be super helpful for getting insights around the test executions that occur based on how my extension may or may not affect them.\r\n\r\n[ExecutionEventRecorder](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/junit-platform-engine/src/test/java/org/junit/platform/engine/test/event/ExecutionEventRecorder.java) seems to have some functionality that would be helpful in getting a deep insight to what a custom Extension might be doing, but it looks like it's not published as an API to consumers?\r\n\r\nAnd some digging around led me to find things like [ExecutionReportListener](https://github.com/JeffreyFalgout/junit5-extensions/blob/master/extension-testing/src/main/java/name/falgout/jeffrey/testing/junit/testing/ExecutionReportListener.java) exist in the wild (see relevant SO question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46841243/how-to-test-extension-implementations), but it still has some holes in it's implementation.  For example, it doesn't propagate information like test run duration, start and end times, test hierarchy, etc.\r\n\r\nI took a stab at rolling some custom things to [test the new Junit5 extension docker-compose-rule in this branch](https://github.com/dotCipher/docker-compose-rule/tree/e2b97809e832575c7d210d8170cf263a39f45f98/docker-compose-rule-junit5/src/test/java/com/palantir/docker/compose/test) (full PR here: https://github.com/palantir/docker-compose-rule/pull/223) that include the metadata I was referring too above, but wanted to know if there was a better way of doing it, or if something was published already.  If not, I would be requesting this functionality from Junit5.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #1621 \r\n- #1662 ","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1356/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1356/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
