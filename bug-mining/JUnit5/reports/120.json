Overview\r\n\r\nBased on discussions in #905, we have decided to use `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)` by default for test classes written in Kotlin.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes\r\n\r\nThe following utility (courtesy of @sdeleuze) can be added to `ReflectionUtils` for detecting Kotlin classes without any external dependencies.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static boolean isKotlinClass(Class<?> clazz) {\r\n\tfor (Annotation annotation : clazz.getDeclaredAnnotations()) {\r\n\t\tif (annotation.annotationType().getName().equals(\"kotlin.Metadata\")) {\r\n\t\t\treturn true;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Use `Lifecycle.PER_CLASS` as the test instance lifecycle mode by default for test classes written in Kotlin.\r\n- [x] Document in User Guide and Release Notes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/991/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
