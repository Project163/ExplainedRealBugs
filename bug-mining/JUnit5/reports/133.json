Background\r\n\r\nInvoking `clazz.getPackage().getImplementationVersion()` can currently return `null` on Java 9 while returning a valid implementation version on Java 8. See the discussion in #598 for details.\r\n\r\nFor example `PackageUtils.getAttribute(Object.class, Package::getImplementationVersion)` returns an empty `Optional` on Java 9 when passed a class that resides in a module (e.g., `java.base`).\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nPackage versioning is **NOT** supported for _Modular JAR Files_ (i.e., JARs containing `module-info.class`).\r\n\r\nExcerpt from the [JAR File Specification](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Modular) for Java 9:\r\n\r\n> JAR files that are deployed as modules declare (explicitly or implicitly) their dependencies and may declare service providers too. The JAR Manifest is ignored. On the other hand, JAR files on the class path use the META-INF directory for security, versioning, or service configuration. \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n  - [x] Determine if classes such as `Object` which reside in the `java.base` module even have such metadata associated with their packages.\r\n - See _Analysis_ section above.\r\n- [x] Find an alternative to `PackageUtils.getAttribute(...)` for module versioning on Java 9.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
