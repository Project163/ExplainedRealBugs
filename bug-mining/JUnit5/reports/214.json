many cases the strings passed to `@DisplayName` are just a prettified version of the class/method name, e.g.:\n\n``` java\n@DisplayName(\"List\")\nclass ListTest {\n    @Nested\n    @DisplayName(\"when empty\")\n    class WhenEmpty {\n        @Test\n        @DisplayName(\"can add\")\n        void canAdd() {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt might be a nice-to-have if this could happen automatically, e.g.:\n\n``` java\n@DisplayName(prettify = true)\nclass ListTest {\n    @Nested\n    class WhenEmpty {\n        @Test\n        void canAdd() {\n            ...\n        }\n        @Test\n        @DisplayName(\"can't get\")\n        void cantGet() {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Related Issues\n\n- #145\n- #153\n- #432 \n- #1036 \n- #1577 \n-
