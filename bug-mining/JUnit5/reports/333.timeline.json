Overview\r\n\r\nFeature request to add native support to rerun failing flaky tests\r\n\r\n**Feature request** \r\n\r\nIs there any plan to support the ability of rerunning failed flaky tests? For example, it would be great to have something like `@Flaky(rerun=3)`, which would rerun a failing flaky test up to n times.\r\n\r\nIn the *past*, in Surefire/Failsafe we could use `rerunFailingTestsCount`. However, it does not work in JUnit 5. As JUnit 5.0.0 was released nearly 1 year ago, it is unclear if and when it will be supported in Maven.\r\n\r\nAnd, even if it will be supported in Maven in the future, it could be good to have a special annotation to specify that only some tests are expected to be flaky, and not *all* of them.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the workaround is to stick with JUnit 4, which is a kind of a shame as JUnit 5  has a lot of interesting features :(  (which I can only use in projects with no flaky tests)\r\n\r\nRelated [SO
