Overview\r\n\r\nIt's fairly common to require `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-jupiter-params` and `junit-jupiter-engine` when writing tests. Currently this means that any build file need three distinct imports, and possible a version property declaration to ensure version compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe currently [Maven](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/c155a7f0d8683d2274856569388720e44841abcb/junit5-jupiter-starter-maven/pom.xml#L19-L36) and [Gradle](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/c155a7f0d8683d2274856569388720e44841abcb/junit5-jupiter-starter-gradle-groovy/build.gradle#L13-L15) samples themselves show such a setup.\r\n\r\nIt would really help the getting started experience if a single `junit-jupiter` dependencies was available that pulled in the others transitively. The would change a Maven build from this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<project>\r\n\t...\r\n\t<properties>\r\n\t\t<junit.jupiter.version>5.3.1</junit.jupiter.version>\r\n\t</properties>\r\n\t<dependencies>\r\n\t\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t\t<groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t<artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t<version>${junit.jupiter.version}</version>\r\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\r\n\t\t</dependency>\r\n\t\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t\t<groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t<artifactId>junit-jupiter-params</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t<version>${junit.jupiter.version}</version>\r\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\r\n\t\t</dependency>\r\n\t\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t\t<groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t<artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t<version>${junit.jupiter.version}</version>\r\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\r\n\t\t</dependency>\r\n\t</dependencies>\r\n\t...\r\n</project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nto this\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<project>\r\n\t...\r\n\t<dependencies>\r\n\t\t<dependency>\r\n\t\t\t<groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t<artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t<version>5.3.1</version>\r\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\r\n\t\t</dependency>\r\n\t</dependencies>\r\n\t...\r\n</project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] A new POM file.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1629/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1629/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
