Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\nIf a suite contains test classes running with different test engines and one of the test engines is filtered out by a `PostDiscoveryFilter`, a JUnitException is thrown and no test is executed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!-- Please insert a code snippet or a link to another repo along with instructions how to reproduce the issue here. The example should be minimal, complete and verifiable (see https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). -->\r\n\r\nSuppose we have the following four classes.\r\n```java\r\npublic class ExcludedTestClass {\r\n\r\n    @org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\r\n    public void test() {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class IncludedTestClass {\r\n\r\n    @org.junit.Test\r\n    public void aTest() {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectClasses;\r\nimport org.junit.platform.suite.api.Suite;\r\n\r\n@Suite\r\n@SelectClasses({ ExcludedTestClass.class, IncludedTestClass.class})\r\npublic class SuiteClass {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.platform.engine.FilterResult;\r\nimport org.junit.platform.engine.TestDescriptor;\r\nimport org.junit.platform.engine.support.descriptor.MethodSource;\r\nimport org.junit.platform.launcher.PostDiscoveryFilter;\r\n\r\npublic class Filter implements PostDiscoveryFilter {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public FilterResult apply(TestDescriptor object) {\r\n        if (object.getSource().isPresent() && object.getSource().get() instanceof MethodSource)\r\n            if (((MethodSource) object.getSource().get()).getJavaMethod().getName().startsWith(\"test\")) {\r\n                return FilterResult.excluded(null);\r\n            }\r\n        return FilterResult.included(null);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe class `Filter` is registered as a `PostDiscoveryFilter`. When `SuiteClass` is executed, the test method `IncludedTestClass#aTest` should be executed. Instead, a `JUnitException` is thrown and no test is executed. \r\n\r\nThe reason is that after filtering, the field `launcherDiscoveryResult` of the `SuiteTestDescriptor` still contains the `JupiterEngineDescriptor`, which should not be executed because all of its children were filtered out. Therefore, the `execute` method in the `EngineExecutionOrchestrator` tries to execute this empty `EngineDescriptor`, which leads to the `JUnitException`.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): Jupiter 5.8.2, Vintage 5.8.2, Platform 1.8.2\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Eclipse\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2838/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
