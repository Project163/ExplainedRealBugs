looking through the discovery issues of spring-modulith (to verify the fix for #4681), I noticed discovery warnings for top-level classes annotated with `@Nested`:\n\n```java\n@Nested\n@EnableScenarios\n@SpringBootTest(classes = { TestConfiguration.class, TransactionTemplateTestConfiguration.class })\nclass EnableScenarioIntegrationTests {\n\n\t@Configuration\n\tstatic class TransactionTemplateTestConfiguration {\n\n\t\t@Bean\n\t\tTransactionTemplate transactionTemplate() {\n\t\t\treturn new TransactionTemplate(mock(PlatformTransactionManager.class));\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t@Test // GH-190\n\tvoid injectsScenario(Scenario scenario) {\n\t\tassertThat(scenario).isNotNull();\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nSource:

were executed with 5.12.2 but are no longer executed since 5.13.0 and merely report a discovery issue with severity \"warning\":\n```\nWARNING: TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' encountered a non-critical issue during test discovery:\n\n(1) [WARNING] @Nested class 'com.acme.myproject.moduleB.ModuleBTest$WithoutMocksTest' must not be static.

Run a test class like the one above\n2. Discovery issue is reported and test class is not executed\n\n## Context\n\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.13.2\n - Build Tool/IDE: Maven\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Ensure top-level and `static` classes annotated with `@Nested` are executed as standalone test classes again\n- [x] Report discovery warning for such classes that recommends to remove the annotation or make the test class non-static (if it's not a top-level test class)\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4686/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
