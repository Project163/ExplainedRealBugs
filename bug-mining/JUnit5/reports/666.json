seen in issue #2038 if a class level resource lock is specified, even if it is only a READ lock it will cause all tests that inherit it to run single threaded if any one of those tests uses a READ_WRITE lock.  It was suggested in a comment by @leonard84 that it might be possible to add an annotation that would apply to a descriptor's children but not to the descriptor itself.  This kind of functionality would be extremely useful in our project because we have 3000+ tests spread over hundreds of test classes.  I would like to apply a READ lock to our commonly used resources in the inheritance chain rather than having to add individual resource locks on each of several thousand tests. However, if I do specify a class level/inherited lock of any kind it makes any class that inherits it run in SAME_THREAD mode if there is any READ_WRITE locks anywhere in the class.\r\n\r\nIn this below example the first two tests run in parallel and tests 3/4 run individually as expected.  But if you uncomment the class level resource lock then all tests run individually.  I would like there to be a way to specify that all of these tests have a READ lock on resource2 without having to add the lock individually to each test:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   // @ResourceLock(value = \"resource2\", mode = READ)\r\n   public class SampleClassLevelLocksTest {\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    @ResourceLock(value = \"resource1\", mode = READ)\r\n    void test1() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        Thread.sleep(2000L);\r\n        Assertions.assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    @ResourceLock(value = \"resource1\", mode = READ)\r\n    void test2() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        Thread.sleep(2000L);\r\n        Assertions.assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    @ResourceLock(value = \"resource1\", mode = READ_WRITE)\r\n    void test3() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        Thread.sleep(2000L);\r\n        Assertions.assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    @ResourceLock(value = \"resource1\", mode = READ_WRITE)\r\n    void test4() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        Thread.sleep(2000L);\r\n        Assertions.assertTrue(true);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement a way to specify resource locks that should be inherited to tests without forcing the tests to run in SAME_THREAD mode if there is a READ_WRITE lock anywhere at the same level\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3102/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
