The contents are subject to change until release.\r\n> \r\n> **Build 8**\r\n> JLine As The Default Console Provider ([JDK-8308591](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8308591))\r\n> core-libs/java.io\r\n> System.console() has changed in this release to return a Console with enhanced editing features that improve the experience of programs that use the Console API. In addition, System.console() now returns a Console object when the standard streams are redirected or connected to a virtual terminal. In prior releases, System.console() returned null for these cases. This change may impact code that uses the return from System.console() to test if the VM is connected to a terminal. If needed, running with `-Djdk.console=java.base` will restore older behavior where the console is only returned when it is connected to a terminal.\r\n> \r\n> A new method Console.isTerminal() has been added to test if console is connected to a terminal.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the console-using standalone test fail on and only on JDK 22-ea: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/actions/runs/5776317412/job/15655302994 - applying `-Djdk.console=java.base` as mentioned above, makes the test(s) green again.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8313893","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3419/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
