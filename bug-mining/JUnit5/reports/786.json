Steps to reproduce\n\nRun any test suite that includes a Robolectric test on a module with JUnit 6.\nThis is normal setup, Android library modules usually have\n* Jupiter 5/6 applied for writing unit tests, and\n* Vintage engine applied for discovering Robolectric tests using runner/rules\n\n<img width=\"1220\" height=\"181\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9053b944-0af3-4373-a7e7-b52b3b22ed50\" />\n\n## Context\n\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 6.0.0\n - Build Tool/IDE: Android Studio Narwhal (2025.1.3)\n\nThe Android world is lagging behind, and Jupiter 5+ first party support is practically non-existent and based on these won't be a thing for years to come.\n\n  * https://developer.android.com/training/testing/local-tests\n * https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/3477\n * https://github.com/android/android-test/issues/224\n\nThere's some community effort, but it's very experimental.\n\n**So I would like to kindly ask for a way to silence this deprecation, so we're not reminded of Google's inaction with a big red warning every day we write tests.**\n\nReferences:\n * [Migration docs we can't apply to Android](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/blob/r6.0.0/documentation/src/docs/asciidoc/user-guide/migration-from-junit4.adoc)\n * https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/blob/cee1471ae77baece801df7efb2b83846d8b1f387/junit-vintage-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/vintage/engine/discovery/VintageDiscoverer.java#L50-L54\n\n## Workarounds\n\n### Downgrade to JUnit 5\n\nOf course we could stick with JUnit 5, but I (and hopefully others too) would like to follow improvements and fixes made in JUnit 6.\n\n### Increase the log level to warning\n\nI'm not sure how to do it, looked at [Discovery issues](https://docs.junit.org/current/user-guide/#running-tests-discovery-issues), but all I can figure out is how to stricten the tests with `junit.platform.discovery.issue.severity.critical`.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- https://github.com/jenkinsci/pom/issues/745\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] An opt-out property.\n- [ ] Automatic detection of Robolectric/Android would be ideal.\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/5030/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/5030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
