the delimiter in `@CsvSource` when using Groovy is extremely limited due to the lack of support of character literals.\r\n\r\nThe only way to configure the delimiter in the annotation that I could find is to cast it to char which requires the class the use of `@CompileStatic`.\r\n\r\nThe [univocity parser](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/blob/v2.8.2/src/main/java/com/univocity/parsers/csv/CsvFormat.java) that is used can take either a `char` or `String` delimiter.\r\n\r\nIn order to offer better support for writing tests in Groovy, please update this annotation so that a string delimiter may be used.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Add support for String delimiters in
