Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #976.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the bug described in _this_ issue existed at a previous point in time is currently unknown (simply because it has not been researched).\r\n\r\nIn any case, we now have a situation where an _overridden_ interface default method is not considered to be overridden by the `findMethods()` search algorithm in `ReflectionUtils`.\r\n\r\nConsequently, if we execute all tests in the following `GenericTestCaseWithOverriddenDefaultMethod` JUnit Jupiter based test class, we see that 3 tests are executed instead of 2. Specifically, we expect that only `test(Long)` and `test(Double)` will be executed; however, `test(Number)` is additionally _discovered_ resulting in `test(Long)` being executed twice.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ExtendWith({ LongParameterResolver.class, DoubleParameterResolver.class })\r\ninterface GenericTestInterface<N extends Number> {\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tdefault void test(N number) {\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass GenericTestCaseWithOverriddenDefaultMethod implements GenericTestInterface<Long> {\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void test(Long number) {\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tvoid test(Double number) {\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nThe recent series of [Whac-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) bug fixes in this area leads to me believe that the only _real_ solution to this set of problems is one that takes into account the actual generic and parameterized type information instead of relying on a best-guess approach involving method sub-signatures and blind checks for the presence of generics.\r\n\r\nDepending on how we _take into account the actual generic and parameterized type information_, we might potentially wish to reverse a subset of changes in fae5b6a4f001e7427fba13b13fb844074d5ff099 that explicitly treat default methods as locally declared methods (while leaving the other changes in that commit in tact).\r\n\r\n## Further Considerations\r\n\r\nThis issue currently only focuses on overridden interface default methods; however, it may well be the case that our `findMethods()` search algorithm contains other bugs related to generics.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #333 \r\n- #976 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure that overridden interface default methods are not returned in the results of `ReflectionUtils.findMethods()`.\r\n- [x] Investigate possible additional bugs hinted at in _Further Considerations_.\r\n  - to be addressed in #981","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
