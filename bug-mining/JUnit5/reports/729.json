Hello 👋 I just tested 1.13.2 and DiscoveryIssueNotifier is flooding me with warnings for my Kotlin setup for contract testing (that works perfectly fine - there are no discovery issues). Is it possible to fix it too or provide possibility to disable this new discovery feature?\n> \n> Pseudocode example:\n> ```kotlin\n> interface DatabaseContract {\n>     val database: Database\n>     \n>     @Test\n>     fun `should save in batch`() {\n>         ...\n>     }\n> \n>     @Test\n>     fun `should read all`() {\n>         ...\n>     }\n> }\n> \n> class InMemoryDatabaseTest: DatabaseContract {\n>     override val database = InMemoryDatabase()\n> }\n> \n> class PostgresDatabaseTest: DatabaseContract {\n>     override val database = PostgresDatabase()\n> }\n> ``` \n\n _Originally posted by @hektorKS in [#4635](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4635#issuecomment-3000880679)_","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
