In this way, we can guarantee the execution flow and allow extension providers to build extension upon this contract.\n\nFor altering the test execution we do not yet provide a mechanism. One would be the resolver based discovery approach (see pull request #134) that would allow extension writers to contribute they own `TestDescriptor` logic to the test plan. It would require to use another annotation like `@RaceConditionTest` but actually, that would absolutely fit your needs for the race condition testing. One could also add another `TestDescriptor` for running EDT tests. If they require a very specific environment, then one might want to declare the test as `@SwingComponentTest` or whatever you name it, and let it be resolved to another specific `TestDescriptor` that handles this special case.\n\nTo me, all of your examples seem to be very specific use-cases which might not need to be composable and, therefore, are perfect candidates for `TestResolver`s.\n\n@schauder : Please have a look and contact me if you have further questions.

(nesting) statements only works if all statements do the exact right thing as of exception handling, ordering, calling before/after behaviour etc.; the difference between correct and incorrect can be

The framework has no means to influence things from the outside.

execution in a different thread, we've discussed two alternatives this morning in a team call:\n\n#### (1) Add a `TestExecutor` extension point\n\n``` java\ninterface TestExecutor extends ExtensionPoint {\n    void execute(TestExtensionContext context, Executable executable);\n}\n```\n\n#### (2) Add a `ExecutorProvider` extension point\n\n``` java\ninterface ExecutorProvider extends ExtensionPoint {\n    Executor getExecutor(TestExtensionContext context);\n}\ninterface Executor {\n    void execute(Runnable runnable);\n}\n```\n\nEither could be used to execute test methods in a different thread. However, in both cases `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` methods and `BeforeEach`-/`AfterEachExtensionPoints` would still be executed in the \"main\" thread. Is that what you would want?\n\n---\n\nRegarding repeating tests, we think we should first get a grip on dynamic tests.

Composing (nesting) statements only works if all statements do the exact right thing as of exception handling, ordering, calling before/after behaviour etc.; the difference between correct and incorrect can be subtle. The framework has no means to influence things from the outside. Thus it's easy to compose statements if you control all of them, but it becomes erratic as you compose unknown ones from different sources.\n> \n> One could of course introduce an extension point that takes an Executable of the test method only and returns a different Executable. My fear is that it would be abused for all kind of before/after/exception-handling stuff - just because it's so easy to do. And then we'd be in the same place as we were with JUnit4.\n\n@jlink, I couldn't have phrased it better myself! \n\nI share the exact same concerns and have for a long time: these are in fact the reasons that we opted _not_ to implement extensions in JUnit 5 using the _Chain of Responsibility_ pattern like JUnit 4's rules.\n\nHowever, having said that, I do understand that some extensions may need to control/spawn the thread in which a test executes. To that end, something like a `TestExecutor` or `ExecutorFactory` extension could suffice.\n\n_But..._ at the very least we need to _guide_ developers to use the standard extensions and not abuse these _executor_ extensions, and as Johannes pointed out: we need to be very careful about the ramifications of introducing such an extension.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/190338219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":571642533,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTcxNjQyNTMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/571642533","actor":{"login":"jlink","id":103937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink","html_url":"https://github.com/jlink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T19:09:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":571642534,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU3MTY0MjUzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/571642534","actor":{"login":"jlink","id":103937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink","html_url":"https://github.com/jlink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-29T19:09:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
