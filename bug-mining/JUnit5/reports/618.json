Summary\r\n\r\nI find myself writing the following.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest(name = \"{0}\")\r\n```\r\n#2301 introduced a way to name an argument, but it feels very unnatural to be used for multiple argument test cases.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation in that issue is to do the below with the `name` as defined above.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nreturn Stream.of(\r\n    arguments(named(\"Test Case Name\", firstArg), secondArg, thirdArg),\r\n    arguments(named...)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would much rather have something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nreturn Stream.of(\r\n    named(\"Test Case Name\", arguments(firstArg, secondArg, thirdArg)),\r\n    named(\"Other Case Name\", arguments...)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #2301\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nProvide the ability to name an individual parameterized test invocation by wrapping the `Arguments` in `Named<Arguments>` rather than wrapping a specific argument in `Named<T>`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
