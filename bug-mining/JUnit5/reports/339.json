in the process of trying to update the baseline version of Eclipse used in our `BundleEngine`. This has in turn updated the baseline version of JUnit 5 from an ancient version (5.0.0 of Jupiter and 1.0.1 of junit-platform) to something more recent.\r\n\r\nOur `BundleEngine` used to make use of `SingleTestExecutor`, which is now deprecated. The deprecation note in `SingleTestExecutor` advises to use `ThrowableCollector.execute()` and `ThrowableCollector.toTestExecutionResult()` instead:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/01e00d21016554dcdabd5a993a88a2f20cab6df9/junit-platform-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/engine/support/hierarchical/SingleTestExecutor.java#L29-L30\r\n\r\nHowever, `toTestExecutionResult()` is package private.\r\n\r\nThe code is simple enough that I can (and will) roll our own in `BundleEngine`. However, this is an annoyance and means it's not a 100% replacement for `SingleTestExecutor` (where this functionality was public).\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n1. make `toTestExecutionResult()` public, or\r\n2. document a publicly-available alternative in the `SingleTestExecutor` deprecation note.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
