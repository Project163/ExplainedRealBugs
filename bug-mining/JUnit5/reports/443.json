Overview\r\n\r\nThe [User Guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#writing-tests-display-name-generator) states that execution of the `DisplayNameGeneratorDemo` test class results in the following output when using the `ConsoleLauncher`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-- DisplayNameGeneratorDemo [OK]\r\n  +-- A year is not supported [OK]\r\n  | +-- A negative value for year is not supported by the leap year computation. [OK]\r\n  | | +-- For example, year -1 is not supported. [OK]\r\n  | | '-- For example, year -4 is not supported. [OK]\r\n  | '-- if it is zero() [OK]\r\n  '-- A year is a leap year [OK]\r\n    +-- A year is a leap year -> if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100. [OK]\r\n    '-- A year is a leap year -> if it is one of the following years. [OK]\r\n      +-- Year 2016 is a leap year. [OK]\r\n      +-- Year 2020 is a leap year. [OK]\r\n      '-- Year 2048 is a leap year. [OK]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the following is the actual output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  +-- DisplayNameGeneratorDemo [OK]\r\n  | +-- A year is not supported [OK]\r\n  | | +-- A negative value for year is not supported by the leap year computation. [OK]\r\n  | | | +-- For example, year -4 is not supported. [OK]\r\n  | | | '-- For example, year -1 is not supported. [OK]\r\n  | | '-- if it is zero [OK]\r\n  | '-- DisplayNameGeneratorDemo$A year is a leap year [OK]\r\n  |   +-- DisplayNameGeneratorDemo$A year is a leap year -> if it is divisible by 4 but no...

[OK]\r\n  |     '-- Year 2020 is a leap year. [OK]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `@Nested` test classes using the `IndicativeSentences` display name generator incorrectly have `DisplayNameGeneratorDemo$` prepended to their display names.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure that the display name for a test class that makes up the beginning of the \"indicative sentence\" does not include the display name of the enclosing class.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
