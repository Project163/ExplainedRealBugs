request the ability to run only \"untagged\" tests.\r\n\r\nMost tests will run with default arguments and should not require `@Tag(\"fast\")`. Other tests require special needs or take a long time so we tag them (i.e. `@Tag(\"slow\")`). I would prefer not to require the majority of tests to be tagged at all.\r\n\r\nCurrent workarounds include parsing the code for all declared instances of `@Tag(\"*\")` or using the [Launcher#discover](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/a425b2c52b92befc148962f90d1358014cb38aec/junit-platform-launcher/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/launcher/Launcher.java#L82) method in the build phase, such that all found tags can be excluded.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- Provide a keyword (i.e. \"all\") for the `excludeTags` property to exclude all tests that are tagged **OR** some solution providing the equivalent result.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1679/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1679/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
