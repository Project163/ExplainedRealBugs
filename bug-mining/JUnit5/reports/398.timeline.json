at JUnitPioneer (@vlsi, @pbludov: you may want to check out our [`@DefaultTimeZone` and `@DefaultLocale`](https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/default-locale-timezone/) annotations :blush:), we ran into a problem where we configure a stricter security manager for one of our tests and it leads to random problems in other tests. In [this comment](https://github.com/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/pull/253#issuecomment-665235062) I wrote:\r\n\r\n> 1. There seems to be no simple way to express that, despite all the parallelism that was enabled for the other tests, the security-manager tests should be run on their own. The only solution seems to be resource locks that need to be applied to _all_ tests.\r\n> \r\n> 2. The security manager tests behave similarly to the many extensions we have that change global state (e.g. default locale) and arguably, the same problem can arise there: While we can use resource locks to keep tests using our extensions from treading on one another, we can't prevent \"unextended\" tests from running concurrently to extended ones. The user would have to apply respective annotations. Which sucks.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Right now it feels like this is a serious problem for all extensions that touch global state that unextended tests may also use: There is no way to run these concurrently without adding annotations to tests that are seemingly unrelated to the extended ones. Worse, it may be very hard to even find the ones that need to be forced into single threads.\r\n>\r\n> I wonder whether an `ExecutionMode` like `SingleThreaded` would make sense.\r\n\r\nWhile we arrived there independently of one another, our problem and analyses are identical and @pbludov suggested the same solution.

I'm currently adding parallel support to Spock and we have an extension [@ConfineMetaClassChanges](http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.3/all_in_one.html#_confinemetaclasschanges) for tests that manipulate one or more meta classes in groovy, this is by its nature a global change potentially affecting all other tests. The extension automatically sets the `READ_WRITE` lock for the MetaClassRegistry, but every other test would also need to acquire a `READ` lock for the same resource for it to be effective.\r\n\r\nSo a way to mark a test/class to run in a global exclusive mode would be a nice solution for this kind of problems.\r\n\r\nA possible implementation would be that each test acquires either a `READ` or `READ_WRITE` lock to a special `___global___` resource, this is always done as the first lock. If nothing else is set only a `READ` lock is acquired, for exclusive tests you switch it to `READ_WRITE` mode. We would need to change the deadlock avoidance algorithm a bit to treat the global lock in a special way so as not to cause all tests to run in `SAME_THREAD` mode.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/668065909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leonard84","id":1151511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTE1MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1151511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84","html_url":"https://github.com/leonard84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/668409251","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2142#issuecomment-668409251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2142","id":668409251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODQwOTI1MQ==","user":{"login":"nipafx","id":6537432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzc0MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6537432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx","html_url":"https://github.com/nipafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nipafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-04T06:37:19Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T06:37:19Z","body":"I'd
