this you can use EnumSet and [LazyParams](https://github.com/lazyparams/lazyparams) to cook your own parameterization solution ...\n```java\nimport java.util.EnumSet;\nimport static org.lazyparams.LazyParams.pickValue;\n\npublic class EnumParams {\n\n    public static <E extends Enum<E>> E pickFromRange(\n            String paramName, E from, E to) {\n\n        if (null == from) {\n            from = EnumSet.allOf(to.getDeclaringClass()).stream()\n                    .findFirst().get();\n\n        } else if (null == to) {\n            to = EnumSet.allOf(from.getDeclaringClass()).stream()\n                    .sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder())\n                    .findFirst().get();\n        }\n        return (E) pickValue( paramName, EnumSet.range(from, to).toArray());\n    }\n}\n```\nThe above method can then be used to achieve parameterization in midair during the execution of a regular JUnit test:\n```java\n@Test\nvoid plus_unsupportedUnits() {\n    Instant now = Instant.now();\n    ChronoUnit unit = EnumParams.pickFromRange(\"unit\", ChronoUnit.WEEKS, null);\n    assertThrows(UnsupportedTemporalTypeException.class,

not with bytecode manipulation but an `@EnumRangeSource(from = \"..\", to = \"..\")` might be a good fit with the other sources Pioneer offers, and that could be implemented with `EnumSet::range`, like in [#4185 (comment)](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/4185#issuecomment-2538072003).\n\nThat's what I meant as

Thank you for sharing the interesting solution using LazyParams approach.\n\n@marcphilipp\nThere are certainly further programmatic solutions e.g. `assumeTrue(unit.compareTo(WEEKS) > -1);` in the beginning of the parameterized test method,\nbut I would prefer a convenient, declarative and **built-in** solution and I don't think a potential EnumRangeSource justifies the introduction of junit-pioneer in the codebase for now.\n\nAnother approach could just extend `EnumSource.Mode` with `RANGE` entry to avoid new attributes in `@EnumSource`.\nThen it would look like (just brainstorming):\n* `@EnumSource(names = \"WEEKS..FOREVER\", mode = RANGE)`.\n* `@EnumSource(names = \"[WEEKS,FOREVER]\", mode = RANGE)`\n* `@EnumSource(names = \"(DAYS,FOREVER]\", mode = RANGE)`\n*
