working with parallel test execution in JUnit 5.3.1, I came across a mystery that I have not yet solved wherein I can trick JUnit into running more concurrent tests than it is configured to run as a side-effect of sleeping a thread inside of a `CompletableFuture` i.e.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    CompletableFuture.runAsync(\r\n              () -> {\r\n                try {\r\n                  Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                  Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n                }\r\n              })\r\n          .join();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this code is present in a test, JUnit will run an additional concurrent test. For example, if `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=4`, one expects at most 4 tests to run concurrently; however if this `CompletableFuture` code snippet is present in all running tests, I observe at most 8 concurrent tests (assuming the total number of tests is greater than 8).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nMaven project [gilday/junit-parallelization-issue](https://github.com/gilday/junit-parallelization-issue) contains code to reproduce this issue. It includes a counter class `HighWaterMark` which observes at most 8 concurrent tests running when `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=4`.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Jupiter 5.3.1\r\n - Maven Surefire 2.22.1\r\n- JDK 1.8\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
