java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.junit.platform.commons.util.ReflectionUtils.getDefaultClassLoader()Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;\r\n\tat

after releasing M5, many users would face this issue as well. Though they may already know how to trick the IDE and use the launcher delivered by the same version as their api, please add corresponding warnings to the user guide and in release notes. We would have to repeat this anyway, but at least we would have a good place where to point.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!
