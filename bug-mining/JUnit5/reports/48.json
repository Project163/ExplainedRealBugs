whom it may concern,\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to have a test, which fails if a particular code snippet takes longer than a certain amount of time to execute.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there is currently only the ability to set a [timeout at the test level](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/timeout-for-tests)... however I feel this has the undesirable side effect of validating the execution time of the test code... I'd like to test only the execution code.\r\n\r\nMore than happy to complete a pull request - depending on whether this behaviour is already supported and whether lambdas are supported.\r\n\r\n**An example:**\r\n\r\nGiven the following timeout method\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n/**\r\n * Ensures a function completes within the given timeout.\r\n */\r\npublic static <Result> Result timeout(final long timeoutMillis, Supplier<Result> invoke){\r\n    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n    Result result = invoke.get();\r\n    long duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;\r\n    if (duration > timeoutMillis) {\r\n        Assert.fail(String.format(\"Actual time %s exceeded timeout %s (millis).\", duration, \r\n                timeoutMillis));\r\n    }\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd the `sayHello` method takes 1000 milliseconds to return\r\nWhen I test the `sayHello` method\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testSomeMethod(){\r\n    String greeting = timeout(500, () -> greetingService.sayHello(\"Nick\"));\r\n    assertEquals(\"Hello Nick\", greeting);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the test should fail with the message `Actual time 1000 exceeded timeout 500 (millis).`","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
