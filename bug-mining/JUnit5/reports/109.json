Feature request\r\n\r\nThe Junit5 Gradle plugin configuration does not lend itself well to being configured with the new [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl).\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to use the following syntax in my Gradle Kotlin DSL build file:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\njunitPlatform {\r\n    filters {\r\n        includeClassNamePatterns(\".*Test\", \".*Tests\", \".*Spec\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is rooted in the fundamental design decision to dynamically add properties to the `JunitPlatformExtention` at runtime with groovy. That means statically typed languages have to jump through hoops to access them.\r\n\r\n[Lines that cause this problem](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/6ded3d033b33d313767550dbd7fc0611f6a485b4/junit-platform-gradle-plugin/src/main/groovy/org/junit/platform/gradle/plugin/JUnitPlatformPlugin.groovy#L30-L35)\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround for this problem in kotlin but it isn't the prettiest.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun org.junit.platform.gradle.plugin.JUnitPlatformExtension.filters(configure: org.junit.platform.gradle.plugin.FiltersExtension.() -> Unit = {}) =\r\n    with(getProperty(\"filters\") as org.junit.platform.gradle.plugin.FiltersExtension) { configure() }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlacing the above code snippet somewhere in my build file allows me to use the syntax I want but it would be better practice if `JUnitPlatformExtension` had member functions that are explicitly declared.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```groovy\r\nvoid selectors(org.gradle.api.Action<SelectorsExtension> closure)\r\n\r\nvoid filters(org.gradle.api.Action<FiltersExtension> closure)\r\n\r\n// ect...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Add `selectors` method to `JUnitPlatformExtension`\r\n- [x] Add `filters` method to `JUnitPlatformExtension`\r\n- [x] Add `packages` method to `FiltersExtension `\r\n- [x] Add `tags` method to `FiltersExtension `\r\n- [x] Add `engines` method to `FiltersExtension `","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/902/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/902/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
