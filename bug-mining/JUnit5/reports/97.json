Overview\r\n\r\nThis issue is a follow up from #720 where [question](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/720#discussion_r105541997)  arose: _Do we really need to prune here (since DefaultLauncher will do it later anyway)?_\r\n\r\nWhen the line `engineDescriptor.pruneTree();` is deleted, three `DiscoverySelectorResolverTests` fail:\r\n\r\n- `resolvingSelectorOfNonTestMethodResolvesNothing()`\r\n- `resolvingUniqueIdWithWrongParamsResolvesNothing()`\r\n- `resolvingUniqueIdOfNonTestMethodResolvesNothing()`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Investigate and decide if the pruning call can be
