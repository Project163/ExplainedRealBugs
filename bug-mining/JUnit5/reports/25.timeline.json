\n\nYou ask hard questions!  A couple hours of writing junk code and trying to reproduce this issue allows me to stand by my assertion regarding allowed character sets.  The answer is that the innermost class named lambda is not allowed per the Java specification to hide it's parent class' name.  It turns out that it doesn't matter to the JVM.  But if you try to do reflection on that class, it's trying to reflect the Kotlin generated classes as though they're Java.\n\nI originally thought there might be a similar problem with generated proxy classes like those used in CDI or JPA but they actually don't hide classes when nested.  There have been similar issues in Scala byte-code.\n\nSo for JUnit 5, I don't think there's a choice except to catch the error.  I would argue that Kotlin should probably fix this (they claim to be 100% compatible with Java).  Even if Kotlin has it's own reflection library, if you include another Java library you never know when that library might use reflection.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/233201248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smoyer64","id":328333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODMzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64","html_url":"https://github.com/smoyer64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoyer64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":725522832,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzI1NTIyODMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/725522832","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-07-17T20:09:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":725522833,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDcyNTUyMjgzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/725522833","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-07-17T20:09:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/233202888","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/401#issuecomment-233202888","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/401","id":233202888,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzIwMjg4OA==","user":{"login":"kevinvandervlist","id":833325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/833325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinvandervlist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinvandervlist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https
