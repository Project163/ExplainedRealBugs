Overview\n\nWhile discussing #4714 with @sormuras, he inquired about the `'null'` display name, which sparked an idea...\n\nNamely, it would be quite nice to have an auto-quote feature for argument values in the display name for a `@ParameterizedClass` or `@ParameterizedTest`.\n\nI therefore propose that we introduce a `boolean quoteText() default true` attribute (or similar) in `@ParameterizedClass` and `@ParameterizedTest` which signals to the `ParameterizedInvocationNameFormatter` that it should wrap `CharSequence` values (naturally including `String`) in double quotes (`\"\"`) and wrap Character` values in single quotes (`''`).\n\nDefaulting to `true` would make this an opt-out feature, but we could of course default to `false` to make it an opt-in feature.\n\nThough, since we are introducing this in 6.0, perhaps it's better to make it an opt-out feature.\n\nNote, however, that a `null` `CharSequence`/`Character` value would continue to be displayed as `null`, not `\"null\"` or `'null'`.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4714 \n- #4783 \n- #4786
