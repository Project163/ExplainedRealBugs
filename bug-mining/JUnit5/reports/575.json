Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report.

Define a AbstractDisabledTest:\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled;\r\n\r\n@Disabled\r\npublic abstract class AbstractDisabledTest {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Define a MainTest:\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.fail;\r\n\r\npublic class MainTest extends AbstractDisabledTest {\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void thisShouldBeDisabled() {\r\n        fail();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Run `gradlew :test`\r\n4. It fails\r\n\r\n`@Disabled` didn't mentioned it cannot be used on parent class, so I opened this issue.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
