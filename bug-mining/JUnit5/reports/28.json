Status Quo\n\nIn order to avoid infinite recursion, the `VintageTestEngine` (specifically its internal `DefensiveAnnotatedBuilder`) will **silently ignore** a test class annotated with `@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)`.\n\nAlthough this behavior is intentional, the fact that the user is not informed of it can lead to confusing results when tests are silently not executed as was the case for a user on Stack Overflow (see link below).\n## Related Resources\n- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39085905/junit-5-empty-test-suite-in-intellij-idea-when-using-junit-jupiter-engine) question\n- [IntelliJ
