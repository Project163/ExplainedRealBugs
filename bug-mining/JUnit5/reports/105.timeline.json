I don't believe a \"community manager\" would be needed yet, but it does sound like something that is inevitable because of the far reaching usage and impacts of JUnit that would lead users to this community. It may be worth trying out as an \"unmoderated\" type of system at first, and seeing how it progresses as more users join before making decisions around moderation.\r\n\r\nTo me I see the some of the benefits as:\r\n\r\n* Ability to be reached by maintainers or those very close to the project when they are available\r\n* Ability for groups to be locally formed and discovered (say for extensions or engines).\r\nSlack makes it dead simple to find other channels of user interest\r\n* Closer interaction for beta / development features\r\n* Responsiveness in general\r\n* Quick questions and opinions can be more responsively answer by the community, and can be easier to approach than going to stackoverflow\r\n\r\nSome of the possible problems I believe are:\r\n\r\n* As JUnit 5 becomes more pervasive, the large size of the community could require a \"community manager\" (like you said)\r\n* Amount of noise for maintainers with already limited time\r\n* Another community to manage\r\n\r\nFrom a personal standpoint, I am a lrage proponent for this close-touch kind of interaction. I have found it to be very effective for understanding and iterating with [`gradle-script-kotlin`](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin) and coroutines from the Kotlin
