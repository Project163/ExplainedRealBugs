migrate to JUnit5.\r\n\r\nNote: Gradle-JUnit5 chokes when it faces JUnit3 test suites with duplicate test names.\r\nI'm not sure if it is a bug in JUnit or in Gradle, and I just add `Describable` implementation for the tests so they return different `uniqueId` values, so it works.\r\nI think it is fine, and we hopefully could migrate those tests to JUnit5 or Spock

runners don't memoize Description instances and even pass different\r\ninstances when invoking testStarted and testFinished. This makes it\r\nparticularly difficult when there are multiple equal Description\r\ninstances in a Runner.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, such cases were deemed unresolvable which lead to\r\nmultiple dynamic TestDescriptors with the same unique ID being reported\r\nwhich is a violation of the contract of TestExecutionListener.\r\n\r\nNow, we assume the testStarted/testSkipped event for a Description with\r\nmultiple equal Descriptions is referring to the first Description that\r\nhasn't yet been started or skipped. The corresponding TestDescriptor is\r\nthen reported as started/skipped. When testFinished is called for such\r\na Description, we check whether the same thread has previously reported\r\nan equal Description as started. If so, we report the corresponding\r\nTestDescriptor as finished.\r\n\r\nFixes #2021.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License
