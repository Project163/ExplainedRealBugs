using a TagFilter to include/exclude a tag that represents a JUnit 4 category, e.g. `com.acme.Foo`, the Vintage Engine correctly returns a filtered tree of `TestDescriptors` after discovery. However, when executing these `TestDescriptors`, Vintage will run all test methods in a class that contains an included test method.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following test class\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ExampleTests {\r\n    @Test\r\n    @Category(Foo.class)\r\n    public void foo() {}\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void bar() {}\r\n}    \r\n```\r\n\r\nand an `includeTags(\"com.acme.Foo\")` filter, Vintage executes both `foo` and `bar`. Similarly, for an `excludeTags(\"com.acme.Foo\")` filter, Vintage runs both methods.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Ensure `PostDiscoveryFilters` are taken into account when executing a test class\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
