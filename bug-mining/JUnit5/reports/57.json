implementing extensions it is common to look for annotations. The easiest way to do this properly (i.e. including repeatable and meta-annotations) seems to be `AnnotationUtils`. It is currently marked as internal API.\n\nAnnotations and especially meta-annotations are a pillar of JUnit 5's extensibility. Being able to freely compose existing annotations according to ones own requirements will be a great boost for customizations. It would be counter-intuitive if third-party extensions would not compose as well. They are hence required to use the same look-up logic as official annotations.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to _encourage_ using the same utility to find annotations.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/246/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
