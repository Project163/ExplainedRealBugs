working on the Apache Camel project which uses parallel execution on a module with a large number of test cases (over 2400 classes and over 6000 tests.) After upgrading to 5.7.2 or later we were getting RejectedExecutionException which we solved by using a custom configuration with a large value for maxPoolSize.\r\n\r\nThe cause appears to be that the Tasks for the test classes all call `ForkJoinPool.managedBlock` and the tests themselves can take up to a few seconds to run. Fairly quickly all threads in the ForkJoinPool are busy and therefore each new call to managedBock causes a new thread to be allocated up to the maxPoolSize. Each of these new threads usually runs only 1 or 2 tests.\r\n\r\nI found that by providing a predicate for _saturated_ when creating the ForkJoinPool, and having it return true, it was possible to run all the tests with a much smaller maxPoolSize.\r\n\r\nCurrently it's not possible to control this parameter using a custom implementation of `ParallelExecutionConfiguration`.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to add a method to the interface such as the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * Get the predicate called when there the ForkJoinPool has reached MaxPoolSize\r\n * and there are no threads available, or null. The predicate should return true if the\r\n * blocking thread should try again. If the predicate is null or returns false a\r\n * RejectedExcecutionException is thrown.\r\n * @return a Predicate accepting a ForkJoinPool as the parameter or null.\r\n */\r\nPredicate<? super ForkJoinPool> getSaturatePredicate();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `DefaultParallelExecutionConfiguration` would return null.\r\n\r\nThe class `ForkJoinPoolHierarchicalTestExecutorService` would use `configuration.getSaturatePredicate()` when creating the `ForkJoinPool`.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
