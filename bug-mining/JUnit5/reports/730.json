working on https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/pull/4692, I noticed FastCSV does not allow extra characters after a closing quote.\n\nThis code:\n```java\n@ParameterizedTest\n@CsvSource(value = \"'foo'bar\")\nvoid extraCharAfterQuote(String argument) {\n}\n```\nthrows the following exception:\n```java\norg.junit.jupiter.params.provider.CsvParsingException: Failed to parse CSV input configured via...\nCaused by: org.junit.jupiter.params.shadow.de.siegmar.fastcsv.reader.CsvParseException: \nException when reading first record\nCaused by: org.junit.jupiter.params.shadow.de.siegmar.fastcsv.reader.CsvParseException: \nUnexpected character after closing quote: 'b' (0x62)\n```\n\nThis behavior was allowed by the uniVocity-based implementation, so we should either document this behavior as a _Breaking Change_ or relax the restriction, if possible.\n\n----------\n\n@osiegmar, If I understand correctly, this might be supported via `allowExtraCharsAfterClosingQuote()`. However, this setting doesn't appear to be compatible with the `RelaxedParser` that we currently use.\n\n```java\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: allowExtraCharsAfterClosingQuote is not supported in relaxed mode\n```\nUnfortunately, switching to a different parser is not an option, since we need to preserve [trimming of whitespaces around quotes](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/blob/main/junit-jupiter-params/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/CsvReaderFactory.java#L71).\n\nIs there any known workaround or alternative way to allow extra characters after a closing quote in this context?\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] The change is documented in the _Release Notes_.\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
