just started using `@EnumSource` in a parameterized test. Very handy.\r\n\r\nHowever, after having used it with a few methods, it occurred to me that it could be a little handier and a little DRYer.\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n@EnumSource(MyEnum.class)\r\npublic void myTestMethod(MyEnum param) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe have to specify the enum type twice. This seems to be needless repetition and a possible source of errors.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is in two parts:\r\n\r\n1. The \"value\" parameter of the `@EnumSource` annotation should be inferred by the engine based on the type of the parameter.\r\n2. As a further enhancement, if there is no other configuration needed for the `@EnumSource` annotation, then it would be nice if it were possible to omit it altogether.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n### Proposal part 1\r\n\r\nAbility to write tests as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n// Equivalent to @EnumSource(MyEnum.class)\r\n@EnumSource \r\npublic void myTestMethod(MyEnum param) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n// Equivalent to @EnumSource(value = MyEnum.class, names = {\"VAL1\", \"VAL2\"}))\r\n@EnumSource(names = { \"VAL1\", \"VAL2\" }) \r\npublic void myTestMethod(MyEnum param) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Propsal part 2\r\n\r\nAbility to write tests as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ParameterizedTest\r\n// Equivalent to @EnumSource(MyEnum.class)\r\npublic void myTestMethod(MyEnum param) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
