Overview\r\n\r\nIn surefire reporting, when a test identifier has no class source attached to it, use the display name in the parent as source.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #616 (which used unique-ids of current test instead of display name of parent)\r\n\r\n## Test cases\r\n\r\nContains a new test case for the sourceless case.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a selection of the test cases for checking that certain events fired now also check that the events come with proper class name, method name, and trace writer, if appropriate.\r\n\r\nSome common setup code was refactored to the BeforeEach-annotated method.\r\n\r\n## Refactorings\r\n\r\nExtracted the (somewhat duplicated) code for retrieving a class name from a test identifier into a dedicated method.\r\n\r\n## Additional Change\r\n\r\nThe source-less case covered in this change is now reported using a regular \"SimpleReportEntry\" -- it used to be reported as an \"ignored\" entry, which seems incorrect as it is called from the 'executionStarted' method.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the JUnit Contributor License

I guess the classname is derived from the `MethodSource` I attached to the TestDescriptor.\r\n\r\nIndeed! That made me realize that it's actually wrong to derive it that way, e.g. in the following case.\r\n\r\n### AbstractTestClass.java\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.project;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nclass AbstractTestClass {\r\n    @Test\r\n    void test() {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sub1Tests.java\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.project;\r\n\r\nclass Sub1Tests extends AbstractTestClass {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sub2Tests.java\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.project;\r\n\r\nclass Sub2Tests extends AbstractTestClass {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the Surefire reports will look like this:\r\n\r\n### TEST-com.example.project.Sub1Tests.xml\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<testsuite xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/xsd/surefire-test-report.xsd\" name=\"com.example.project.Sub1Tests\" time=\"0.03\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" failures=\"0\">\r\n  <properties>\r\n    ...\r\n  </properties>\r\n  <testcase name=\"test\" classname=\"com.example.project.AbstractTestClass\" time=\"0.005\"/>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST-com.example.project.Sub2Tests.xml\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<testsuite xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/xsd/surefire-test-report.xsd\" name=\"com.example.project.Sub2Tests\" time=\"0.03\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" failures=\"0\">\r\n  <properties>\r\n    ...\r\n  </properties>\r\n  <testcase name=\"test\" classname=\"com.example.project.AbstractTestClass\" time=\"0.005\"/>\r\n</testsuite>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the `classname` is derived from the `MethodSource` which _correctly_ points to the source location of the test case. However, `classname` should be `com.example.project.Sub1Tests` and `com.example.project.Sub2Tests`, respectively.\r\n\r\n> Is there some way for the engine to influence how the report is generated?\r\n\r\nI think that would be a good way out of this dilemma for this \"legacy\" XML report. Ultimately, we need a new reporting format (see #373).\r\n\r\n@junit-team/junit-lambda What do you think about adding a way for a `TestIdentifier` to specify `classname` and `methodname`?
