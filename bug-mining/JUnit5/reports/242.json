Overview\r\n\r\nBased on feedback on the `TestWatcher` extension API by @marcphilipp in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/1393#discussion_r205951408, there are still a few issues that need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n> I checked and `context` is indeed `null` when `prepare()` throws an exception which happens when an exception occurs creating the test instance.\r\n> \r\n> If we want to report such failed tests to extensions as well and I think we should, we need to change `prepare` to add the exception to `ThrowableCollector` instead and add `context.getThrowableCollector().assertEmpty()` to `JupiterTestDescriptor.shouldBeSkipped()` (otherwise a test with a failing constructor could be reported as skipped).\r\n> \r\n> One more thing I noticed: When something fails on the test class level, e.g. an exception a `@BeforeAll` method, `TestMethodTestDescriptor` never gets called. I think we should clearly document this limitation in the Javadoc of `TestWatcher`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #542 \r\n- #1393 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Investigate and address the aforementioned issues.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1730/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
