my suggested approach.  Let me know if this is OK and I'll start work a pull request.\r\n\r\nCurrent code:\r\n* ConsoleLauncher.java is the entry point\r\n* CommandLineOptionsParser is a service  used in the launcher\r\n* PicocliCommandLineOptionsParser is the provider of this service\r\n* CommandLineOptions is (kind of) a value type.\r\n\r\n\"kind of\" because it is all getter/setter except for `getExplicitSelectors()` and `getExistingAdditionalClasspathEntries()`:\r\n```\r\n141\t\tpublic List<Path> getExistingAdditionalClasspathEntries() {\r\n142\t\t\treturn this.additionalClasspathEntries.stream().filter(Files::exists).collect(toList());\r\n143\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to refactor the logic on line 142 into a new service whose job is to expand the classpath and then filter it.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n1. new attribute to CommandLineOptions: `List<Path> existingAdditonalClasspathEntries;`\r\n2. change `getExistingAdditionalClasspathEntries()` to return this attribute\r\n1. new service: `org.junit.platform.console.options.ClasspathExpander`\r\n2. with one method:`List<Path> expandClasspath(List<Path> paths);`\r\n2. new provider: `org.junit.platform.console.options.ClasspathExpanderProvider` that expands and filters.\r\n3. update `ConsoleLauncher.java` to use this pair, making it look like the existing service/provider code.  Add one line that calls CommandLineOptions setter for existingAdditonalClasspathEntries.\r\n\r\nI considered putting this logic into the existing parser service.  I didn't suggest that because the two services will change for different reasons.  Arg parsing logic will change if you add/delete options.  Path expansion logic will change (rarely!) to stay in sync with how java jar classpath expansion works.\r\n\r\nI also thought about defining a new value type for the Expanded version of the command-line options.  That is more disruptive to existing code, which I want to leave as-is as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I also considered making the CommandLineOptions getExistingAdditionalClasspathEntries() return a copy of the list (immutability), but that could break existing code.  And the class has a public setter.
