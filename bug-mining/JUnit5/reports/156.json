Overview\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/710#issuecomment-287634552, JUnit Jupiter should ideally have lifecycle support for objects stored in the `ExtensionContext.Store`.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the execution of a given level in the test execution hierarchy has completed, we should properly _close_ the execution context and any objects within it.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce lifecycle support for objects stored in `ExtensionContext.Store`.\r\n  - Specifically, for objects that implement `Closeable` or `AutoCloseable`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
