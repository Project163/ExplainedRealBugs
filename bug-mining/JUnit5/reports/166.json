Overview\r\n\r\nI just happened to have a test only failing on MS Windows machines and thought about JUnit Jupiter.\r\n\r\nI could write a custom extension implementing `ContainerExecutionCondition` and `TestExecutionCondition`, but having a predefined `@Disabled` annotation such as `@DisabledIfWindows` or `@Disabled(condition = IsWindowsEvaluator.class)` to extend disabling feature might be handy.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #1247\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] system property matches a pattern\r\n- [x] environment variable matches a pattern\r\n- ❌  current day of week matches one of the supplied enums\r\n  - The team decided not to publish `@EnabledOnDayOfWeek` and `@DisabledOnDayOfWeek`.\r\n- [x] current OS matches one of the supplied enums\r\n- [x] current JRE version matches one of the supplied enums\r\n- [x] Check for user configuration errors. For example, if a user declares `@EnabledOnOs({})`, that should result in an exception instead of a disabled result.\r\n- [x] Introduce integration tests for each condition.\r\n- [x] Write JavaDoc for each annotation.\r\n- [x] Document in User Guide.\r\n- [x] Document in Release Notes.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
