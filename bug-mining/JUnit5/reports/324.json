Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nReproducer: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/pull/113\r\n\r\nI admit that JUnit3 is kind of old, however https://github.com/apache/jmeter contains quite a few `suite()`-driven tests. It would be nice if Vintage executor could account for `TestSuite` names as well when producing `TestIdentifier`s\r\n\r\nRelevant JMeter PR: https://github.com/apache/jmeter/pull/496.\r\nI tried to add `implements Descriptable` all over the place. It does help to a degree, however it does not really help when the test must be run twice (e.g. with different `setup` methods). \r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 5.5.1\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Gradle 5.5.1\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
