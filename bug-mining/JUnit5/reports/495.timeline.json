am working on an extension for tests to be able to react to failed tests or tests that end in exception by including a method annotated with `@OnFailure`.  \r\n\r\nMy specific high-level \"requirement\" is to be able to rebuild a Hibernate `SessionFactory` in these cases.  That method needs access to the `SessionFactory` to be rebuilt.  Actually it is a `SessionFactoryScope` class that manages a `SessionFactory` and exposes it via a `ParameterResolver`.  E.g.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@SessionFactory\r\npublic class MyTest {\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void theTest(SessionFactoryScope scope) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this test fails, I'd like to be able to access the `SessionFactoryScope` to trigger it to release its `SessionFactory` and build a new one.  To do that it needs access to the `SessionFactoryScope`.  I.e.:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @OnFailure\r\n    public void rebuild(SessionFactoryScope scope) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, JUnit Jupiter does not allow access to registered ParameterResolvers nor any way to invoke such \"extension methods\" with resolved parameter arguments.\r\n\r\nSeems like a generally useful feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2393/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-02T13:52:35Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T13:52:35Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2561","id":820027248,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MjAwMjcyNDg=","number":2561,"title":"Dynamic
