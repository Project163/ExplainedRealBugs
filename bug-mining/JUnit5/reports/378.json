11 introduced the [`String#lines()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#lines()) method, which _\"returns a stream of lines extracted from this string, separated by line terminators\"_.\r\n\r\nTo better support that form of \"ordered strings\", overloads of `assertLinesMatch` in class `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` with `Stream<String>` variants should be added. Those new methods should only delegate to the existing `List<String>` methods by collecting a strings returned by the streams.\r\n\r\n## Usage examples\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertLinesMatches(Stream.of(\"first\", \"second\"), \"first\\nsecond\".lines());\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\nassertLinesMatches(Stream.of(\"one\", \"two\"),\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    one\r\n    two\"\"\".lines());\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Add `assertLinesMatches(Stream<String>, Stream<String>)`\r\n- [x] Add `assertLinesMatches(Stream<String>, Stream<String>, String)`\r\n- [x] Add `assertLinesMatches(Stream<String>, Stream<String>, Supplier<String>)`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
