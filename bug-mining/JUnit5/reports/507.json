our own purposes, we have implemented additional assertion methods (`assert...(...)`) in a test utility class. Motivated by reusing existing functionality, this class makes use of the static methods of  `org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionUtils`; mostly for throwing assertion errors and for formatting error messages. `AssertionUtils` and most of its methods, however, are package-protected. In order to make them visible to our class, we have put it in the same package `org.junit.jupiter.api`. Now that we are using Java's module system, we can no longer proceed this way since Java's module system does not allow to have the same package in more than one module. Therefore I would like to propose to make `org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionUtils` public as well as all its methods that are currently package-protected.\r\n\r\nNote that there are a couple of other utility classes in `org.junit.platform.commons.util` that are already public; though `org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionUtils` is in `junit-jupiter-api` while `org.junit.platform.commons.util` is in `junit-platform-commons`. I'm not necessarily proposing to also relocate `AssertionUtils` into `junit-platform-commons`: But if that makes sense, it seems better. `junit-platform-commons` is already a compile dependency of `junit-jupiter-api`.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Pull request?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
