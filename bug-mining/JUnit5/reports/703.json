there, and thanks for JUnit! :wave:\r\n\r\nMy team has recently migrated to JUnit 5, and previously we were previously using the [junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner](https://github.com/bechte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner) for nested tests.\r\nOne big difference from that one is that on JUnit 5 the native nested tests require that nested classes be annotated with the `@Nested` annotation.\r\n\r\nWe've now been using it for a few weeks, and my team found that sometimes we forget to add an `@Nested` annotation to an inner class.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a test suite that is _apparently_ green, but that in reality is missing tests, and is hard to spot.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to either:\r\n\r\n* add a validation that would warn us that we could possibly be missing `@Nested` -- by for instance detecting that a nested class had JUnit annotations on it but would not be executed\r\n\r\n* have a mode/option/top-level annotation for executing tests in nested classes without needing an explicit `@Nested`\r\n\r\nThanks! :pray: \r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\n* #242\r\n*
