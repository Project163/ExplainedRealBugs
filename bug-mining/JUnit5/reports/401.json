#2168 being addressed in milestone 5.7 M1 by extending the set of allowed element types it is possible to also annotate field declarations in addition to classes and methods: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/68bb2e3124da100ff00608c44fcd75dd3061f593/junit-platform-commons/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/commons/annotation/Testable.java#L73\r\n\r\nAnother use-case for `@Testable` are test modules:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Testable\r\nopen module test.integration {\r\n  requires test.base; // read helper module\r\n  requires org.junit.jupiter; // read Jupiter API modules\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nmodule test.base {\r\n  exports test.base; // contains helpers\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith such an annotation attached to a module declaration, clients (like IDEs and build tools) may detect ahead of time if a module wants to be launched in a test run. Here, the `test.integration` module is annotated with `@Testable` which would yield a call like:\r\n\r\n`junit --select-module test.integration`\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `test.base` module is not annotated with `@Testable` -- which would prevent a similar `junit` call for module `test.base`. If a client launched `junit` for `test.base`, no test containers nor tests would be found and executed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTest run finished after 1 ms\r\n[         0 containers found      ]\r\n[         0 containers skipped    ]\r\n[         0 containers started    ]\r\n[         0 containers aborted    ]\r\n[         0 containers successful ]\r\n[         0 containers failed     ]\r\n[         0 tests found           ]\r\n[         0 tests skipped         ]\r\n[         0 tests started         ]\r\n[         0 tests aborted         ]\r\n[         0 tests successful      ]\r\n[         0 tests failed          ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEspecially, if `--fail-if-no-tests` option is used, this may lead to surprising results.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\n\r\nA forward-compatible solution is dropping the `@Target` annotation from `Testable`'s declaration. Due to...\r\n\r\n> If an `@Target` meta-annotation is **not present** on an annotation type `T` , then an annotation of type `T` may be written as a modifier for any declaration except a type parameter declaration.\r\n\r\nCopied from [Target](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/annotation/Target.html)'s API documentation.
