Status Quo\r\n\r\nJUnit Jupiter currently tracks exceptions during the execution of test methods and test factory methods (and their corresponding callbacks) and then makes such exceptions available to extensions via `TestExtensionContext.getTestException()`; however, there is no analogous support for exceptions thrown during the execution of container-level callbacks.\r\n\r\n## Related
