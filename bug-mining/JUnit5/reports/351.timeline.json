`JUnit4VersionCheck`, it seems it recently starts to support better versioning in this https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/commit/f30c96a9cad89a62a28750c5fe4dd83ad4333e99 commit that went to junit-vintage-engine:5.7.0`.\r\n\r\nHowever the latest maven surefire plugins depends on `junit-platform-launcher:1.3.2` that eventually depends on `junit-vintage-engine:5.3.2` that doesn't support `4.13.1` as versioning scheme.\r\n\r\nForcing an upgrade:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        <plugin>\r\n          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n

</dependencies>\r\n        </plugin>\r\n```\r\nbreaks due to incompatible change over years:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M5:test failed:
