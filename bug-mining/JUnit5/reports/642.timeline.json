Having that info in hands would be a good starting point.\r\n\r\nIt's the same rationale as in `java.util.logging` methods accepting a supplier.: creating a `String` can cause unnecessary overhead if it is never consumed. In logging that happens when the log level is not enabled. In assertions that happens when the assertion succeeds. Coming up with a descriptive example would be the job of whoever decides to tackle this issue. 🙂 \r\n\r\n> At [junit-team/junit5-samples](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples), a sample would be nice to be added, but under what directory?\r\n\r\nI don't think this minor feature justifies a sample in junit5-samples.
