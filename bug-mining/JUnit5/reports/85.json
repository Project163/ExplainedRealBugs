Overview\r\n\r\nThe ```ParameterizedTestParameterResolver``` conflicts with parameter resolution in ```@BeforeEach``` methods in the class containing the ```@ParameterizedTest```.  I would presume that parameterized ```@BeforeEach``` methods in super-classes as well as ```@AfterEach``` methods will have the same problem.\r\n\r\n## Bug report\r\n- JUnit 5 version M4\r\n- Current behavior: The ```ParameterizedTestParameterResolver``` attempts to provide parameter resolution for other methods.  My opinion is that the ```ParameterResolver``` should make sure it's \"injecting\" parameters only for methods annotated with ```@ParameterizedTest```.\r\n- Expected behavior: The parameters provided on a ```@ParameterizedTest``` method would only resolve parameters on the annotated test method.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nIn a class annotated with ```@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)```, the following set-up and test methods are present:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @BeforeEach\r\n  void setUp(@Mock Consul.Builder consulBuilder, @Mock Consul consulClient) {\r\n    doReturn(consulClient).when(consulBuilder).build();\r\n    \r\n    consulKeyInjector = new ConsulKeyInjector();\r\n    consulKeyInjector.consulBuilder = consulBuilder;\r\n    consulKeyInjector.consulClient = consulClient;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @ParameterizedTest\r\n  @CsvSource({\r\n      \"CamelCase, CAMELCASE\",\r\n      \"dotted.java.property, DOTTED_JAVA_PROPERTY\",\r\n      \"ALREADY_AN_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, ALREADY_AN_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE\"\r\n  })\r\n  void testToEnvironmentName(String input, String expected) {\r\n    String actual = ConsulKeyInjector.toEnvironmentName(input);\r\n    assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in this case, other ```@Test``` methods in this class are actually using the mocks.  When this class' tests are executed, the following failure is logged:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntestToEnvironmentName(String, String)  Time elapsed: 0.001 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolutionException: Discovered multiple competing ParameterResolvers for parameter [com.orbitz.consul.Consul$Builder arg0] in executable [void edu.psu.swe.consul.ConsulKeyInjectorTests.setUp(com.orbitz.consul.Consul$Builder,com.orbitz.consul.Consul)]: edu.psu.swe.consul.MockitoExtension, org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTestParameterResolver\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Work-around\r\n\r\nAllow the ```MockitoExtension```'s ```TestInstancePostProcessor``` to inject the mocks into member fields in the test class as shown below:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Mock\r\n  Consul.Builder consulBuilder;\r\n  \r\n  @Mock\r\n  Consul consulClient;\r\n  \r\n  ConsulKeyInjector consulKeyInjector;\r\n  \r\n  @BeforeEach\r\n  void setUp() {\r\n    doReturn(consulClient).when(consulBuilder).build();\r\n    \r\n    consulKeyInjector = new ConsulKeyInjector();\r\n    consulKeyInjector.consulBuilder = consulBuilder;\r\n    consulKeyInjector.consulClient = consulClient;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Limit the ```ParameterizedTestParameterResolver```'s scope to only the method it's annotating.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/833/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
