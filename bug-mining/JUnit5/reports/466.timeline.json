is an implementation of #1970. It depends on #1977. \r\n\r\n@joel-costigliola , I know you asked for two separate PRs. I found this a bit unworkable as the functionality changes for `SoftAssertionsExtension` depended on the API change. However, I at least added them as two separate commits in this PR so that you can still review them separately if you wish - I hope that's ok. If you still really want separate PRs, I'll see what I can do (it's more work, that's all).\r\n\r\n#### Check List:\r\n* Fixes #1970 \r\n* Unit tests : YES \r\n* Javadoc with a code example (on API only) : NOT YET - I anticipate possible changes to the implementation as part of the review process that might alter the API; prefer to wait for that process to finish before proceeding.\r\n\r\n#### Feature divergence from SoftlyExtension\r\n\r\nSome of the features of the proposed field injection diverge from the implementation in `SoftlyExtension`. The intent is for these divergences to be seen as enhancements, but I'm open to other opinions. :smile:\r\n\r\n* `PER_CLASS` lifecycle support: Unlike `SoftlyExtension` (which uses the instance creation callback to construct the soft assertions instance), this implementation uses the `BeforeEachCallback` hook to do the injection. This means that the restriction on test class lifecycle in `SoftlyExtension` to prohibit use with `PER_CLASS` lifecycle semantics can be (and has been) lifted.\r\n* Unlike `SoftlyExtension`, multiple `SoftAssertionsProvider` instances are supported. Errors from the multiple providers will be aggregated, in-order, into the same base error collector class, so that when the extension asserts after the test has run it will contain all assertion failures registered against all soft assertions providers in the order that they were executed. The same is true if you mix parameter injection with field injection. This is, I think, a big improvement over what we've had up until now, courtesy of the `AssertionErrorCollector` abstraction and the use of the delegate feature.\r\n* `SoftAssertionsExtension` will refuse to inject into a field that is private, final or static. This follows a policy set by the Jupiter implementation. However, strictly it is a departure from `SoftlyExtension` which allowed injection on final or private fields.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are backwards compatible. Those that aren't I'm not too concerned about, as `SoftlyAssertion`, is still marked as beta. \r\n\r\n#### Known issues/for discussion\r\n\r\n* `PER_CLASS` will not mix well with `CONCURRENT` execution mode. At the moment there is no check. I have raised junit-team/junit5/issues/2396 to discuss this. Failing any progress on that point (and for earlier versions of JUnit), there is an alternative I can look at to try and do this kind of sanity check.\r\n* Pending the above issue, it may also be possible to allow injection into a `ThreadLocal<? extends SoftAssertion>` instance if you are combining `PER_CLASS` and `CONCURRENT`.\r\n* With the current implementation, if you annotate a nested class with `SoftAssertionsExtension`, it will also try and inject into all of the enclosing instances if they have a `SoftAssertionsProvider` field present. This is true even if the enclosing types are not annotated with `SoftAssertionsExtension`. This was necessary to make the test class (which I ported from `SoftlyExtension\r\n* The current implementation is technically a breaking change, as any existing classes that use the extension and have a `SoftAssertionsProvider` field will suddenly find the extension attempting to inject into it whereas before it didn't. Worse, in cases where you may have marked the field as static, final or private, the test will suddenly start to fail with a complaint about this. I'm not sure how widespread these usage patterns are to know whether or not this is a major concern. If it is, there are a couple of possible workarounds:\r\n** Don't attempt to set the field if it is not null. This approach will not work with `PER_CLASS` functionality though.\r\n** Require an annotation on the field to flag it as being for injection. This is the approach we settled on in osgi-test and it seems to work well (eg, to inject a `BundleContext` instance using the `BundleContextExtension`, it is necessary to annotate it with `@InjectBundleContext`) - allowing people to mix their own soft assertions fields with ones intended for injection. It is a little more verbose on the usage side, however.\r\n* `AssertionErrorCollector.getDelegate()` currently returns `Optional<AssertionErrorCollector>`, not sure if it would be better to return `AssertionErrorCollector`.\r\n* Should `SoftlyExtension` be deprecated in favour of this new functionality?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj/issues/1984/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3711749779,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzcxMTc0OTc3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/3711749779","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-31T21:26:54Z","rename":{"from":"ExtensionContext

Empirically, it seems that the ExtensionContext always returns the lifecycle mode that is in force. Something similar would be useful for the concurrency mode. \r\n\r\nFor reference,  have a look at joel-costigliola/assert-core#1984. I needed to change the behavior based on the concurrency mode to use a ThreadLocal if it is concurrent & per class, but wanted to avoid this overhead otherwise. For the Per Class mode it's straightforward as it won't run concurrent unless explicitly annotated, so i can just check for the presence of the annotation.
