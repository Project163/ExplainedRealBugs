working on [QuickPerf](https://github.com/quick-perf), a tool to create performance related test with JUnit.\r\nFor QuickPerf, we need to be able to launch a test on a different JVM instance, so we need to be able to fork a JVM from within an extension.\r\n\r\nMy current implementation is to fork the VM inside the extension in `interceptTestMethod` method: https://github.com/quick-perf/quickperf/blob/master/junit5/src/main/java/org/quickperf/junit5/QuickPerfTestExtension.java#L49\r\n\r\nDoing this, the method is executed twice (once on each VM), so I would like to be able to skip the test method execution is the host VM but the `Invocation` must be proceed or I have an error.\r\n\r\nToday I invoke twice the test methods, what I would like is to have a way to skip a test invocation.\r\n\r\nA possible implementation would be to add a `skip` method to the `Invocation` so we can skip it's execution.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\nModify the `Invocation` to be able to skip it.\r\nI can provide a PR for this.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2083/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2083/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
