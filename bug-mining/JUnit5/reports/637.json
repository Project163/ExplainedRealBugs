implementations based on non-default file systems like [jimfs](https://github.com/google/jimfs) and [memoryfilesystem](https://github.com/marschall/memoryfilesystem) cannot work with `@TempDir` annotated elements of type `File`.\r\n\r\nSee also the `Path::toFile` [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Path.html#toFile()):\r\n\r\n> **Throws:**\r\n>    `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this `Path` is not associated with the default provider\r\n\r\nRight now, a test like [the example in the user guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-TempDirectory), but with `tempDir` of type `File`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\nvoid test(@TempDir(factory = JimfsTempDirFactory.class) File tempDir) {\r\n    // perform test\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic class JimfsTempDirFactory implements TempDirFactory {\r\n\r\n    private final FileSystem fileSystem = Jimfs.newFileSystem(Configuration.unix());\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Path createTempDirectory(AnnotatedElementContext elementContext, ExtensionContext extensionContext) throws IOException {\r\n        return Files.createTempDirectory(fileSystem.getPath(\"/\"), \"junit-\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void close() throws IOException {\r\n        fileSystem.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nfails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolutionException: Failed to resolve parameter [java.io.File arg0] in method [void

more\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to improve the user experience, clearly stating that `File` annotated elements are not supported.\r\n\r\nAs of today, the factory doesn't have easy access to the type of the annotated element.\r\n\r\nIn my extension for Jimfs, I've implemented a workaround:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scordio/jimfs-junit-jupiter/blob/ac6f085a89368823e7f515f335eb44f21d981447/src/main/java/io/github/scordio/jimfs/junit/jupiter/JimfsTempDirFactory.java#L86-L107\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\nI see two possible directions:\r\n\r\n1. JUnit owns the error handling and asks the factory if `File` annotated elements are supported\r\n    * This could be done with a new default method in `TempDirFactory`, e.g., `boolean supportsFile()`.\r\n3. The error handling happens in the factory\r\n    * `AnnotatedElementContext` should expose the element type somehow so that the factory can build up the error handling around it without having to cast the result of `getAnnotatedElement()`. For example, a new `Class<?> getAnnotatedElementType()` method could be added to `AnnotatedElementContext`.\r\n\r\nMy preference goes to option 1 to reduce duplication in each `TempDirFactory` implementation.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to contribute once a solution is agreed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelates to:\r\n* scordio/jimfs-junit-jupiter@99d946e3ca99c807fb70e28e48b6c588027f3e0a\r\n* marschall/memoryfilesystem-junit-provider#2\r\n\r\nCC @marschall","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
