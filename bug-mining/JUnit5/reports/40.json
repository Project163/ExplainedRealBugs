allows users to run 2 test methods of the same test class. This is done now through `LauncherDiscoveryRequest`, like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        List<DiscoverySelector> selectors = new ArrayList<>();\r\n          while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\r\n            selectors.add(createMethodSelector(line));\r\n          }\r\n          builder = builder.selectors(selectors);\r\n          if (tagName != null && !tagName.isEmpty()) {\r\n            builder = builder.filters(TagFilter.includeTags(tagName));\r\n          }\r\n          return builder.build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks well in most cases, but if both methods belong to the same class, then only the first one would be executed. After debugging it turns out that `org.junit.jupiter.engine.discovery.JavaElementsResolver#tryToResolveWithResolver` detects that there is already a corresponding class but instead of replacing newly created `ClassTestDescriptor` with old one, newly created descriptors are returned, and second method is added there and this subtree is lost.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
