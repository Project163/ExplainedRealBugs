Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThis does not work every time as it is dependent on multiple factors.\r\n\r\n- Checkout https://github.com/spockframework/spock/commit/b69f9f115abfbdb381e8e32a9a9063d93c68588a\r\n- run `./gradlew :spock-specs:test --rerun -Dvariant=3.0 -DjavaVersion=21`\r\n- You might need to try a few times. This depends a bit on your machine, but if it takes longer than 5m then it is most likely stuck.\r\n- You can attach a debugger to inspect the current executing tests\r\n\r\n## What is Broken?\r\nAs you can see in these two screenshots we switch from executing `MockSpecInfoAnnotationSpec` to `ByteBuddyMockFactoryConcurrentSpec` due to workstealing. The problem is that `MockSpecInfoAnnotationSpec` holds a read-lock for the `org.junit.platform.engine.support.hierarchical.ExclusiveResource.GLOBAL_KEY` but `ByteBuddyMockFactoryConcurrentSpec` needs a write-lock.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/654e0b0e-49ff-48fb-a3a5-d67e8b8f84d5)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b39fc6a-a290-42fd-95f2-0048123e6753)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please insert a code snippet or a link to another repo along with instructions how to reproduce the issue here.
