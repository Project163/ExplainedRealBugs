new JUnit5 is going to ship with parallel execution:\n\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/60\n\nand this is something I'd really want to see in Selenium too. \n\nI have a lot of (more than 300) selenium tests and I have a very complex initialization process before running them:\n- first import SQL scripts\n- then import data into database from csv files.\n- then import some more data from rest API calls.\n- then perform some data manipulation in the database.\n- (we are now 10 minutes in the build)\n- now start executing the tests against the populated database.\n- Finish (usually takes ~ 2:20 minutes).\n\nMy problem is that CircleCI marks my build as timeout (they have a 2-hour limit) and I really can't have a green build :( I can't use selenium-grid because I have no access to CircleCI. I don't want to distribute the selenium tests to run on different machines because then I have to perform the same database initialization on each node and this means that the tests are executed against (potentially) different databases.\n\nIs it possible to align with JUnit5 and provide some sort of parallel execution where tests run in separate tabs or separate browser windows?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/2644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/2644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":790360021,"node_id":"MDE1OlVuYXNzaWduZWRFdmVudDc5MDM2MDAyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/790360021","actor":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unassigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-15T08:09:53Z","assignee":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-15T14:32:08Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T14:32:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/169","id":137958431,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMzc5NTg0MzE=","number":169,"title":"Demonstrate

Overview\n\nBased on discussions I've had with developers in the community, it is apparent that some people fear an upgrade from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. Aside from the fact that it's totally feasible to run JUnit 4 tests alongside JUnit 5 tests, we should still attempt to migrate an existing JUnit 4 test suite just to see where the hurdles are.\n## Proposal\n\nDemonstrate how to migrate from JUnit 4's `ExpectedException` Rule to a JUnit 5 Extension-based alternative.\n## Food for Thought\n\nCan this be achieved with simple search-and-replace?\n\nCan a JUnit 5 extension be implemented that honors JUnit 4's `ExpectedException` transparently, without the need to modify a single line within test methods -- for example, by removing `@Rule` from the `ExpectedException` field and adding `@ExtendWith(SomeExpectedExceptionExtension.class)`?\n## Related Issues\n- #343\n## Related Blogs\n- [How to Replace Rules in JUnit

currently migrating a project from JUnit4 to JUnit5 (Branch: https://github.com/casid/mazebert-ladder/tree/junit5). \r\n\r\nA feature of the JUnit4 tests is that I can run all unit tests in parallel. This is an essential feature since it a) chops down the test execution time significantly and b) prevents developers from adding shared state to unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn JUnit4 with the help of junit-toolbox:\r\n```java\r\n@RunWith(ParallelSuite.class)\r\n@SuiteClasses(\"**/*Test.class\")\r\npublic class UnitTestSuite {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wished JUnit5 to support something like this:\r\n```java\r\n@Suite(parallel = true)\r\n@SuiteClasses(\"**/*Test\")\r\npublic class UnitTestSuite {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't find anything that looked even slightly like it.\r\n\r\nI think suites could greatly improve configuration options for test executions. In fact, it would remove the need for external tools to implement the same features (e.g. parallel execution / test discovery). You could simply point maven-surefire, gradle or IntelliJ to the TestSuite(s) you want to execute.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests could benefit from this too:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Suite(parallel = true)\r\n@SuiteClasses(\"**/*IT\")\r\n@IncludeTags(\"parallel\")\r\npublic class ParallelIntegrationTestSuite {\r\n    @BeforeClass\r\n    public static void setUp() throws Exception {\r\n        TestDataSourceProvider.instance.prepare();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterClass\r\n    public static void tearDown() throws Exception {\r\n        TestDataSourceProvider.instance.dispose();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would love to have something like this in JUnit5! Currently I have some mixed feelings how to proceed with adopting JUnit5 (great new features like nested tests) vs JUnit4 (great test execution control).\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #456\r\n- #687\r\n- #744\r\n- #746\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/964/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/964/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/328130719","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/60#issuecomment-328130719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/60","id":328130719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODEzMDcxOQ==","user":{"login":"leonard84","id":1151511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTE1MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1151511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84","html_url":"https://github.com/leonard84","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonard84/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T15:12:08Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T15:12:08Z","body":"Will this be part of the platform, or the engine, or both?\r\n\r\nWhile thinking about better support for parallel execution in Spock, I identified some problems that should be handled by the testing framework.\r\n\r\n* Parallel (integration) testing in conjunction with global state (system properties/db/...) can leak into other tests\r\n  * e.g., Spock has the `@RestoreSystemProperties` extension, which will save the `SystemProperties` before the execution and restore it after the test. This works fine for single threaded execution, but in concurrent test execution this will lead to race conditions.\r\n  * The bad solution would be to disable concurrent execution\r\n\r\nMy idea is that each test (class/method) could declare its use of global resources, e.g. `@UseResource(value=\"SystemProperties\", mode=ReadWrite)`. The engine would keep a list of `ReentrantReadWriteLock` for each of the resources and acquire/release those locks accordingly.  Care would have to be taken to avoid deadlocks, by ordering the lock acquisition accordingly. \r\n\r\nThis way the framework could offer the maximum concurrency while still offering providing tools to isolate problematic tests.\r\n\r\nThere would be a list of predefined resources, such as `Global` (all tests would implicitly acquire a ReadLock for this) or `SystemProperties`, but users can define their own to match their application.\r\n\r\nThoughts?
