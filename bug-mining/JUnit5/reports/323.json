tests are written in scalatest and run by adding the annotation `@RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])` and using the maven surefire plugin. In one test class we have 14.000 tests. These tests take roughly 4 seconds to execute but 11 minutes to discover.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be connected with `VintageTestDescriptor`. It tries to find the method of a test using `VintageTestDescriptor.findMethod` which in turn enumerates all methods to find the one of the test.\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions:\r\n\r\n* Do not call into `ReflectionUtils.findMethods` _for every test_. This means enumerating ~14.000 methods of that class (plus suplerclass methods) 14.000 times. If we could reuse the computed `List<Method>` of a class instead of recomputing it, that would solve the problem.\r\n\r\n* Do not enumerate all methods to find one. This would mean changing `List<Method> findMethods(Class<?> clazz, Predicate<Method> predicate, HierarchyTraversalMode traversalMode)` and `List<Method> findAllMethodsInHierarchy(Class<?> clazz, HierarchyTraversalMode traversalMode)` to work all the way with `Stream`s instead of `Lists`s so that we do not need to continue enumerating methods once we have found the method, by leveraging the `Stream.findFirst` method. This would help in our particular case. Most of the time is actually spent in `ReflectionUtils.isMethodShadowedByLocalMethods`, which is only called for superclass methods. All of our tests are defined in the concrete class, so we would never need to enumerate that far.\r\n\r\nI will attach a profile of `mvn test` during the test discovery phase for a better analysis.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1965/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1965/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
