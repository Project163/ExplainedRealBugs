Discussed in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/discussions/3896\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **alanwong-toast** July 22, 2024</sup>\r\nI was hoping that [ExecutableInvoker](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/ExecutableInvoker.html) (accessible from `ExtensionContext`) would allow for the invocation of methods/classes with the currently known set of `ParameterResolvers`, but based on my testing, it seems that it only loads with a default set of resolvers and never the resolvers I have injected.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the `DefaultExecutableInvoker` happens here:\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/ae20d63bd301171200a2b0f7b71d5ebd915e0eff/junit-jupiter-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/descriptor/ClassBasedTestDescriptor.java#L149-L151\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/ae20d63bd301171200a2b0f7b71d5ebd915e0eff/junit-jupiter-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/descriptor/ClassBasedTestDescriptor.java#L179-L192\r\n\r\nWith this constructor for `DefaultExecutableInvoker`: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/ae20d63bd301171200a2b0f7b71d5ebd915e0eff/junit-jupiter-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/execution/DefaultExecutableInvoker.java#L40-L42\r\n\r\nIt appears that the new extension registry generated from `populateNewExtensionRegistryFromExtendWithAnnotation` at the top is never passed into the new context that is used to construct the class's context.\r\n\r\nThis results in a default set of resolvers in all cases, regardless of which extension interface I use to get the extension context.\r\n\r\nIs there a correct way to utilize `ExecutableInvoker` such that the context of the currently running test has access to that test's `ParameterResolvers`?</div>","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
