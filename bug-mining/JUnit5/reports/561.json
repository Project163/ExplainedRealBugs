Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI am trying to do the same as shown in documentation in https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-registration-programmatic, where the following example appears:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\n\r\n@Target({ ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER })\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n@ExtendWith(RandomNumberExtension.class)\r\npublic @interface Random {\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass RandomNumberDemo {\r\n\r\n    // use random number field in test methods and @BeforeEach\r\n    // or @AfterEach lifecycle methods\r\n    @Random\r\n    private int randomNumber1;\r\n\r\n/* . . . */\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, my extension (only implements `BeforeAllCallback`) only gets invoked when `private int randomNumber1;` is made static `private static int randomNumber1;`.\r\nI don't know if this is an issue with the code or the documentation. Any clarifications would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): Jupiter 5.9.0\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Maven & IntelliJ\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
