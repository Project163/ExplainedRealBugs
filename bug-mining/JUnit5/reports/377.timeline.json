points!\r\n\r\nNote that we actually already have support for `FilePosition` in `FileSource`, `ClassSource`, and `ClasspathResourceSource`.\r\n\r\nSee `FilePosition.fromQuery(String)` for the supported syntax.\r\n\r\nThus, adding the support proposed in this issue would align our `FilePosition` support in sources and selectors, making that support symmetrical which it arguably should have already been.\r\n\r\nI am therefore in favor of adding this support to selectors.\r\n\r\n@junit-team/junit-lambda,

First time contributor here; I've started out with adding `FilePosition` as optional argument to `FileSelector` and `ClasspathResourceSelector` here: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/compare/master...timtebeek:master\r\n\r\nNot sure if this was as intended; and it's likely nowhere near done to resolve this issue, but I'd like to get some feedback on what should be the next logical steps. To start with:\r\n\r\n- The challenge outline above has me slightly confused as to what would (not) be required to resolve the issue. Can anyone expand on that a bit?\r\n- While @mpkorstanje mentioned he would also like to see file position added to `UriSelector` there's no mention of it in the team decision; Is that out of scope for this feature?\r\n- Would I need to add methods with FilePosition argument to `org.junit.platform.engine.discovery.DiscoverySelectors` ?\r\n\r\nAny further guidance would be much appreciated; I had thought to open a pull request only if it seems feasible I'll be able to finish the

Summary\r\nProvide a JUnit 5 extension for cucumber.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nWhen writing a test with JUnit 5 in our environment, we need to replicate a base environment in a way that we use different Extensions in order to to run tests. So we like  to have a Scenario something like this:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n@ExtendWith(CucumberExtension.class)\r\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\r\n@ExtendWith(BaseBusinessEnvironmentExtension.class)\r\nclass MyBusinessTest {\r\n   @BeforeEach\r\n    void init(@Mock Person person) {\r\n        when(person.getName()).thenReturn(\"Dilbert\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void simpleTestWithInjectedMock(@Mock Person person) {\r\n        assertEquals(\"Dilbert\", person.getName());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nAt the moment under JUnit 4 we needed to tweak the Cucumber runner in order to call default JUnit 4 annotations.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nWe like to help create an CucumberExtension that handles the Cucumber specific annotations for JUnit 5  as an JUnit 5 extension, so that it can be combined with other extensions as for example mocking frameworks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1149/reactions","total_count":81,"+1":81,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
