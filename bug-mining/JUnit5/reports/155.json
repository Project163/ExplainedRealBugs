Overview\r\n\r\nAt the moment, only test engines have access to configuration parameters.\r\n\r\nCopied from http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-config-params : _In addition to instructing the platform which test classes and test engines to include, which packages to scan, etc., it is sometimes necessary to provide additional custom configuration parameters that are specific to a particular test engine._\r\n\r\nExtension authors may want to configure their extension based on such arguments as well.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\n- #497\r\n- #1135 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add method `Optional<String> getConfigurationParameter(String key)` to
