Jupiter 6.0.0 added `@Nullable` annotations.\n\nI believe `TypedArgumentConverter` is missing such an annotation for the return type of its [protected `convert`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/blob/9e7e122a45d11d51ea2fb2203c5c6f1dad45fbb7/junit-jupiter-params/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/params/converter/TypedArgumentConverter.java#L92) method.\n\nCurrently the signature is:\n\n```java\nprotected abstract T convert(@Nullable S source) throws ArgumentConversionException;\n```\n\nI believe this should be:\n\n```java\nprotected abstract @Nullable T convert(@Nullable S source) throws ArgumentConversionException;\n```\n\nThis would simplify writing Kotlin code using `TypedArgumentConverter`. \n\nThe following Kotlin code does not compile against JUnit Jupiter 6.0.0:\n\n```kotlin\nclass DummyConverter : TypedArgumentConverter<String, String>(String::class.java, String::class.java) {\n    override fun convert(source: String?): String? = source\n}\n```\n\nI believe that with an additional `@Nullable` annotation as shown above this code would compile.\n\nThe current workaround in Kotlin is somewhat ugly as it requires an unchecked cast:\n\n```kotlin\nclass DummyConverter : TypedArgumentConverter<String, String?>(String::class.java, String::class.java as Class<String?>) {\n    override fun convert(source: String?): String? = source\n}\n```","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/5105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/5105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
