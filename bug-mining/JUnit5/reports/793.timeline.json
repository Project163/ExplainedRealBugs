Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Set up parallel test execution, for example, with 4 fixed threads\n2. Write a test class with multiple test methods, apply `@ResourceLock` annotation to one of the methods\n3. Declare this class a template and make a couple of invocations for it\n4. Run the test class. Code example is provided below\n\n```\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=true\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default=concurrent\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed\njunit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=4\n```\n```\n@ClassTemplate\n@ExtendWith(MethodResourceLockClassTemplateExtension.class)\npublic class MethodResourceLockClassTemplateTest {\n\n  @Test\n  void test1() throws InterruptedException {\n    Thread.sleep(2000);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void test2() throws InterruptedException {\n    Thread.sleep(2000);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  @ResourceLock(\"1\")\n  void test3() throws InterruptedException {\n    Thread.sleep(2000);\n  }\n}\n```\n```\n@NullMarked\npublic class MethodResourceLockClassTemplateExtension implements ClassTemplateInvocationContextProvider {\n\n  @Override\n  public boolean supportsClassTemplate(ExtensionContext context) {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Stream<? extends ClassTemplateInvocationContext> provideClassTemplateInvocationContexts(ExtensionContext context) {\n    return Stream.of(new ClassTemplateInvocationContext() {}, new ClassTemplateInvocationContext() {});\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Expected result\n\nAll tests are being run in parallel, the annotated test method respects the resource lock\n\n## Actual result\n\nAll tests are being run sequentially\n\n## Context\n\n - Used versions (Jupiter/Vintage/Platform): 6.0.0\n - Build Tool/IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

idea would be to introduce a new `boolean requiresGlobalReadLock()` method on `Node`. By default, it would return `true` and Cucumber could override it to return `false` for their containers that don't execute any user code or callbacks. Instead of assuming that the direct children of the engine descriptor require the `GLOBAL_READ_LOCK`, `NodeTreeWalker` would call this method and use the topmost node returning `true` in all subtrees

of `HierarchicalTestEngine` can now specify which nodes\nrequire the global read lock by overriding the new\n`Node.isGlobalReadLockRequired()` method to return `false`.\n\nThis allows for more fine-grained locks when intermediate container do\nnot have any behavior of their own and thus do not require even the\nglobal read lock.\n\nResolves #2982.\n\n<!-- Please describe your changes here
