I think it is.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this discussion I'll be using the `HierarchicalTestEngine` as reference. I'm assuming that other `TestEngine` implementations have a comparable layout and can apply a similair approach.\r\n\r\nThe `HierarchicalTestEngine` comes with a `HierarchicalTestExecutorService` which is created by invoking `createExecutorService` with the `ExecutionRequest` as a parameter.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\tprotected HierarchicalTestExecutorService createExecutorService(ExecutionRequest request) {\r\n\t\treturn new SameThreadHierarchicalTestExecutorService();\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `ExecutionRequest` contains an `EngineExecutionListener`. \r\n\r\nBecause the `EngineExecutionListener` exists before the `HierarchicalTestExecutorService` is created it will not be possible to implement a `pleaseStop` on the `HierarchicalTestExecutorService`. \r\n\r\nHowever prior to execution the `HierarchicalTestExecutorService` could ask the `EngineExecutionListener` if it should execute the next task. So we can implement `EngineExecutionListener.canWeContinue()`.\r\n\r\nFor example looking at `ForkJoinPoolHierarchicalTestExecutorService.ExclusiveTask` the implementation would have to do something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\tstatic class ExclusiveTask extends RecursiveAction {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate final TestTask testTask;\r\n                private final EngineExecutionListener listener;\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic void compute() {\r\n                        if (!listener.canWeContinue()){\r\n                               testTask.skip(); // This would execute the test task and result in a Skipped status.\r\n                               return;\r\n                        }\r\n\t\t\ttry (ResourceLock lock = testTask.getResourceLock().acquire()) {\r\n\t\t\t\ttestTask.execute();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tcatch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n\t\t\t\tExceptionUtils.throwAsUncheckedException(e);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaming would obviously have to be improved a bit and I think the `canWeContinue` might best be placed on it's own separate interface rather then in `EngineExecutionListener`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/572276980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mpkorstanje","id":6946919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6946919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje","html_url":"https://github.com/mpkorstanje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mpkorstanje","id":6946919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6946919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje","html_url":"https://github.com/mpkorstanje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpkorstanje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-08T22:01:15Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T22:01:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1854","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-jvm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1854/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1854/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1854/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1854","id":545753990,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDU3NTM5OTA=","number":1854,"title":"Cucumber

Generating reports or cleaning up data.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that a mechanism be added that allow a test to gracefully exit the suite.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd a new RunListener which listens for a specific exception coming from a test failure.  If that exception is detected request that the test suite is abandoned using [RunNotifier.pleaseStop()](http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runner/notification/RunNotifier.html#pleaseStop()).\r\n\r\nThis may be a new cucumber-specific exception or there may already be an exception which fits this purpose.  E.g.

Due to the SPI can be easily loaded anywhere, why don't you introduce a new getter `default` method `getStoppable` in `TestTask` . As well as you have another resource method `getResourceLock`. The default method would return the default Stoppable. The IDEs may easily override the behavior from default to custom just by adding the `Stoppable` SPI to the classpath. The execution of engine would be isolated from the `EngineExecutionListener` and it has to because `the listener has different purpose`. And really the `pleaseStop` method is not necessarily derived from the status notified by the `EngineExecutionListener` and no reason to force the user to implement a listener only due to one method and register the listener for orthogonal

part of the Bndtools project we've been working on an interactive OSGi testing environment based on JUnit Platform. It supports hot re-deployment of code (both application code and test code) and re-running of the tests without having to restart the framework. This is extremely useful for speeding up the development cycle for integration tests of code in the framework when that framework has a long startup time. It makes the Test-Driven Development cycle much more feasible and efficient.\r\n\r\nWhile it is clear that JUnit was not originally designed with interactivity in mind, nevertheless it seems to work pretty well for the most part. But there is one major feature missing from JUnit Platform that would make it work even better, and that's the lack of a reliable cancellation mechanism - once the launcher has started executing a `TestPlan`, there is no reliable way to stop it. In an interactive scenario, I have often found that I start a new test run only to notice that the tests all start failing due to some bug I introduced. I find and fix the bug, but then I still have to wait a minute or so for the test plan to finish executing before I can run the tests again. Alternatively, I have to terminate the container and restart it (which is usually even slower). What I would really like is to be able to cancel the test run once I notice the first few failures so that I don't have to wait before restarting it with the fix included.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this would not be a difficult feature to add, although it probably couldn't be implemented in the platform alone - it would need each individual engine to support it too. As a quick idea:\r\n\r\n* `Launcher.execute()` will require an asynchronous variant that returns an object representing the current execution (`LauncherExecutionHandle`, perhaps). This interface implemented by this object would contain (among possible other things) a `cancel()` method.\r\n* `TestEngine` will likewise require an asynchronous variant that returns an object representing the current engine execution (`EngineExecutionHandle`).
