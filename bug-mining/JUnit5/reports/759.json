Overview\n\nIn commit f6f1a701dd945abd0ee44407cc26f08024a03039, `Launcher.execute(TestPlan, TestExecutionListener[])` and `Launcher.execute(LauncherDiscoveryRequest, TestExecutionListener[])` were officially deprecated in favor of the new `Launcher.execute(LauncherExecutionRequest)` variant which requires a `LauncherExecutionRequest`.\n\nHowever, given a `LauncherDiscoveryRequest discoveryRequest`, code like the following which has worked for years...\n\n```java\nlauncher.execute(discoveryRequest);\n```\n\n... must now be migrated to something like the following in order to avoid deprecation warnings (which can fail builds, depending on developer preferences).\n\n```java\nLauncherExecutionRequest executionRequest =\n    LauncherExecutionRequestBuilder.request(discoveryRequest).build();\n\nlauncher.execute(executionRequest);\n```\n\nThat is unfortunate, since it requires developers to modify working code in a fashion that is more complex than it should be.\n\nAs of #4865, that can alternatively be implemented as follows with a static import for `LauncherExecutionRequestBuilder.executionRequest`.\n\n```java\nlauncher.execute(executionRequest(discoveryRequest).build());\n```\n\nThat is effectively still a single line of code and remains rather readable (despite the need to invoke `.build()`); however, I think we would be doing the community a big favor by undeprecating `Launcher.execute(TestPlan, TestExecutionListener[])` and `Launcher.execute(LauncherDiscoveryRequest, TestExecutionListener[])`.\n\nDevelopers will still need to interact with a `LauncherExecutionRequest` for more advanced use cases (like registering a `CancellationToken`), but such uses cases are less common.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4724 \n- #4865
