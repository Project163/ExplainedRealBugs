Overview\r\n\r\nMany methods in classes and interfaces of package `org.junit.platform.commons.util` are using the two parameters `classNameFilter `and `classTester` in their signature their like:\r\n```\r\nT method(... Predicate<Class<?>> classTester, Predicate<String> classNameFilter, ...)\r\n```\r\nIn most cases the actual values are just passed down the call-stack.\r\n\r\nThis issue proposes to introduce a wrapper named `ClassFilter` or `ClassTester` that could look like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@API(status = INTERNAL, since = \"1.1\")\r\npublic class ClassFilter {\r\n\r\n\tpublic static ClassFilter of(Predicate<Class<?>> classPredicate, Predicate<String> namePredicate) {\r\n\t\tPreconditions.notNull(classPredicate, \"class predicate must not be null\");\r\n\t\tPreconditions.notNull(namePredicate, \"name predicate must not be null\");\r\n\r\n\t\treturn new ClassFilter(classPredicate, namePredicate);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprivate final Predicate<Class<?>> classPredicate;\r\n\tprivate final Predicate<String> namePredicate;\r\n\r\n\tprivate ClassFilter(Predicate<Class<?>> classPredicate, Predicate<String> namePredicate) {\r\n\t\tthis.classPredicate = classPredicate;\r\n\t\tthis.namePredicate = namePredicate;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic boolean test(Class<?> type) {\r\n\t\treturn classPredicate.test(type);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic boolean test(String name) {\r\n\t\treturn namePredicate.test(name);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith such a type, the internal method signature will reduce to:\r\n```\r\nT method(... ClassTester classTester, ...)\r\n```\r\nand if we ever need to add another predicate, it can be done in the wrapper type w/o changing the signature of the internal methods.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor internal methods to use the new class tester wrapper type\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sormuras","id":2319838,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk4Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2319838?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras","html_url":"https://github.com/sormuras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sormuras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
