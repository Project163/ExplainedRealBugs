Overview\r\n\r\nWe use the `TestInstancePostProcessor` to inject handles to external resources. These resources need to be released after the tests is completed. \r\n\r\nDepending on the concrete test this might happen after each test method or after the class is completed.\r\n\r\nWe use the `TestInstance` `Lifecycle` to control the injection of new handles (for each method or for each class) and register to `afterEach` and `afterAll` to do the cleanup depending on the instance lifecycle. To make this work we have to do read the `Lifecycle`, check whether to release or collect instances, and so on.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nWith a `TestInstanceFinalizer` extension, executed after JUnit Jupiter is finished running tests in this particular test instances (depending on the Lifecycle), cleanup could be implemented more easily.\r\n\r\nThis would be the counterpart of the existing `TestInstancePostProcessor`; all other Extensions have a counterpart.
