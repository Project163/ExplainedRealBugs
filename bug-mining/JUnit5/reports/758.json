and `LauncherExecutionRequestBuilder.request()` currently compete with each other if users wish to use static imports for both of those methods.\n\nTechnically, one can use static imports for both of those methods side by side; however, that results in code which is a bit confusing for the reader.\n\nTo address that and improve the programming model, we should introduce `discoveryRequest()` and `executionRequest()` aliases in those builders, respectively.\n\nThis aligns with existing aliased methods such as `Arguments.of()`/`Arguments.arguments()`, `Named.of()`/`Named.named()`,
