recently introduced `PreconditionAssertions` to simplify tests which assert that a `PreconditionViolationException` was thrown; however, I haven't found the time to make sure we consistently use `PreconditionAssertions`.\n\nWe still have around 350 uses of `PreconditionViolationException.class` in the code base, and most of those are assertions that could be replaced with `PreconditionAssertions`.\n\nFor example, tests like this:\n\n```java\n@Test\nvoid exceptionWithoutAnyFilters() {\n    var actual = assertThrows(PreconditionViolationException.class, () -> new OrFilter(Set.of()));\n    assertEquals(\"filters must not be empty\", actual.getMessage());\n}\n```\n\n... can be replaced with:\n\n```java\n@Test\nvoid exceptionWithoutAnyFilters() {\n    assertPreconditionViolationFor(() -> new OrFilter(Set.of())).withMessage(\"filters must not be empty\");\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since we intend to backport several things from `main` to 5.x in the near future, we should hold off on refactoring our test suite until the backports have been completed. Consequently, I have tentatively assigned this task to the 6.0.0 milestone.","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4943/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
