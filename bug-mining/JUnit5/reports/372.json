This is correct, as I had not specified any --include-classname nonstandard rule. \r\n\r\nHowever, it would have been really helpful to get a warning message in the style of:\r\nWARNING: you have specified to scan a class FirstTesterMon; however this class will NOT be scanned due to the rules for classname scanning.
