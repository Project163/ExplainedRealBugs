Foreward\r\nFirst off, I want to thank the Junit 5 team from being so willing to officially support Kotlin as a first-class citizen in the Junit 5 library. It has been absolutely wonderful being able to use my own contributions in all of my Kotlin projects.\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\nI believe that this API can be further enhanced with the new Kotlin 1.3 feature, [Contracts](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew13.html#contracts).\r\n\r\nContracts are making guarantees to the compiler that various methods have certain characteristics.\r\n\r\nHere's an example from the Kotlin Std-Lib:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n/**\r\n * Throws an [IllegalStateException] if the [value] is null. Otherwise\r\n * returns the not null value.\r\n *\r\n * @sample samples.misc.Preconditions.failCheckWithLazyMessage\r\n */\r\n@kotlin.internal.InlineOnly\r\npublic inline fun <T : Any> checkNotNull(value: T?): T {\r\n    contract {\r\n        returns() implies (value != null)\r\n    }\r\n    return checkNotNull(value) { \"Required value was null.\" }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore Kotlin Contracts, the following code wouldn't have compiled:\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun validateString(aString: String?): String {\r\n    checkNotNull(aString)\r\n    return aString\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that JUnit 5 has a few places where these contracts would be valuable.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n#### `assertNotNull`\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n@ExperimentalContracts\r\nfun <T: Any> assertNonNull(actual: T?, message: String): T {\r\n    contract {\r\n        returns() implies (actual != null)\r\n    }\r\n    Assertions.assertNotNull(actual, message)\r\n    return actual!!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above would allow something like this:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval exception = assertThrows<IllegalStateException { /** whatever **/}\r\nval message = exception.message\r\nassertNotNull(message)\r\nassertTrue(message.contains(\"some expected substring\")) \r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it would also allow for this sort of use case:\r\n```kotlin\r\nval message = assertNotNull(exception.message)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `assertThrows` / `assertDoesNotThrow`\r\nSince the `callable` passed to `assertThrows` is only ever called once, we can expose that in the contract.\r\n```kotlin\r\n@ExperimentalContracts\r\ninline fun <reified T : Throwable> assertThrows(noinline message: () -> String, noinline executable: () -> Unit): T {\r\n    contract {\r\n        callsInPlace(executable, InvocationKind.EXACTLY_ONCE)\r\n    }\r\n    return Assertions.assertThrows(T::class.java, Executable(executable), Supplier(message))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilar \r\n\r\nThis would for something like this:\r\n```kotlin\r\nval something: Int\r\nval somethingElse: String\r\nassertDoesNotThrow {\r\n    something = somethingThatDoesntThrow()\r\n    somethingElse = gettingSomethingElse()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\nKotlin Contracts are only supported in Kotlin 1.3 and higher.\r\nThis would require a discussion regarding what version of Kotlin the Junit 5 team want's to officially support.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add Kotlin method `assertNotNull`\r\n- [ ] Add Contracts to Kotlin method `assertNotNull`\r\n- [ ] Add Contracts to Kotlin method `assertThrows`\r\n- [ ] Add Contracts to Kotlin method `assertDoesNotThrow`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1866/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
