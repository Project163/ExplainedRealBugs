Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage a;\r\n\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;\r\n\r\npublic abstract class A {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeAll\r\n    static void before() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"A\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage b;\r\n\r\nimport a.A;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\npublic class B extends A {\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void before() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"B\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void test() {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hi there\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting the test in `B` prints: `B` and `Hi there`.  Note the absence of  `A`: the `@BeforeAll` method was not called.  Note that the non-static `before` method in `B` does not override the static method (it is in a different package), nor does it conflict with it.  Renaming the `before` method in `B` or `A` fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nThis can easily happen when you have an `abstract` base class in some utility package, and you are extending it to build tests.  If you happen to name a method in this test class that conflicts with a package-private method in the base class, things do not work as expected.\r\n\r\n## Workaround:\r\n\r\nEnsure the names in the base class are sufficiently unique that they're unlikely to have similar names in a subclass.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- A fix for this problem.  It probably is a problem with annotation scanning not being thorough enough and not taking this special case into account.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
