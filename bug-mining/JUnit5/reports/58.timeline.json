I think it might make sense to disable logging by default and provide a simple way (e.g. by setting a system property) to enable it that we could document in the user guide.\n\nIf we go that route, I think we'd need to introduce our own custom logging façade to hide that additional level of indirection. Otherwise, everywhere we use logging will need to be modified with additional conditional checks. So I'm not really a fan of that... unless there is some feature of JUL that I'm unaware of which simplifies matters.\n\nIMHO, I think it's a good idea to have logging enabled by default. Otherwise, users wouldn't even be informed of warnings or true errors.\n\nSo, introducing a \"no INFO level logging\" policy is perhaps not such a bad idea for a testing

using JDK 8 and `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1`:\r\n`MalformedParametersException` is thrown when calling `java.lang.reflect.Method#getParameters()` on some synthetic bridge methods.\r\n\r\nConcerns version 5.11.0-M1 only: doesn't occur with 5.10.2 and older releases of \"junit-jupiter-engine\".\r\n\r\nAlso it only happens when using JDK-8:\r\n\r\n- Java               : 1.8\r\n- JVM vendor name    : Private Build\r\n- JVM vendor version : 25.402-b06\r\n- JVM name           : OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM\r\n- JVM version        : 1.8.0_402-8u402-ga-2ubuntu1~22.04-b06\r\n- JVM info           : mixed mode\r\n- OS name            : Linux\r\n- OS version         : 6.5.0-28-generic\r\n\r\nThis only concerns JDK 8. Everything seems to work just fine with later JDKs (e.g. 11, 17, 21).\r\n\r\nThere is something about how `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1` was compiled that makes it not fully compatible with JDK 8.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOutput from this program pinpoints the root problem:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException;\r\nimport java.lang.reflect.Method;\r\nimport java.util.*;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.engine.descriptor.*;\r\nimport org.junit.platform.engine.support.hierarchical.EngineExecutionContext;\r\n\r\nclass MalformedParametersException_forJupiterSyntheticNodeMethodImplementations_onlyOnJdk8 {\r\n    public static void main(String[] ___) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"\\nRunning on \" + System.getProperty(\"java.version\") + \" ...\");\r\n\r\n        java.util.stream.Stream.of(\r\n                JupiterTestDescriptor.class, ClassBasedTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                ClassTestDescriptor.class, MethodBasedTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                TestMethodTestDescriptor.class, TestTemplateTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                TestTemplateInvocationTestDescriptor.class,\r\n                TestFactoryTestDescriptor.class, NestedClassTestDescriptor.class)\r\n\r\n                .forEach(descriptorClass -> {\r\n\r\n            Set<String> reasonsForMalformedParameters = new HashSet<>();\r\n            StringBuilder methodsWithMalformedParameters = new StringBuilder();\r\n            for (Method m : descriptorClass.getDeclaredMethods()) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    m.getParameters();\r\n\r\n                } catch (MalformedParametersException badParameters) {\r\n                    assert m.isSynthetic();\r\n                    assert m.getParameterTypes()[0] == EngineExecutionContext.class;\r\n                    reasonsForMalformedParameters.add(badParameters.getMessage());\r\n                    methodsWithMalformedParameters.append(\"\\n ->\").append(m\r\n                            .toString().substring(\"public\".length())\r\n                            .replaceAll(\"(?<=[ ,(])[a-zA-Z\\\\.]*\\\\.\", \" \")\r\n                            .replaceFirst(\" throws .++\", \"\"));\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            if (false == reasonsForMalformedParameters.isEmpty()) {\r\n                System.out.println(\"\\n\" + reasonsForMalformedParameters\r\n                        + \" was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on \"\r\n                        + descriptorClass.getSimpleName() + \":\" + methodsWithMalformedParameters);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the above program on my laptop, using JDK 8 and `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1`, results in this output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning on 1.8.0_402 ...\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on JupiterTestDescriptor:\r\n ->  Node$SkipResult  shouldBeSkipped( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n -> void  cleanUp( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on ClassBasedTestDescriptor:\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  before( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n -> void  after( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on MethodBasedTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  nodeSkipped( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, Node$SkipResult)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestMethodTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  cleanUp( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n -> void  nodeFinished( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, TestExecutionResult)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  execute( EngineExecutionContext, Node$DynamicTestExecutor)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestTemplateTestDescriptor:\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  execute( EngineExecutionContext, Node$DynamicTestExecutor)\r\n ->  EngineExecutionContext  prepare( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestTemplateInvocationTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  after( EngineExecutionContext)\r\n\r\n[Invalid parameter name \"\"] was thrown for synthetic bridge methods on TestFactoryTestDescriptor:\r\n -> void  nodeSkipped( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, Node$SkipResult)\r\n -> void  nodeFinished( EngineExecutionContext, TestDescriptor, TestExecutionResult)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above pinpoints a root problem that is far away from regular developer concerns, but it causes other indirect problems further down the road. E.g. using Mockito 4.11's `inline-mockmaker` to mock the above classes (on JDK 8) is problematic: \"Mockito cannot mock this class: ...\".\r\n\r\nBut test descriptor classes that don't have these synthetic bridge methods (e.g. `ClassTestDescriptor` and `NestedClassTestDescriptor`) are perfectly mockable.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nAbove program was run with these jars on classpath:\r\n\r\n  - junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1.jar\r\n  - unit-platform-engine-1.11.0-M1.jar\r\n  - junit-platform-commons-1.11.0-M1.jar\r\n  - junit-jupiter-api-5.11.0-M1.jar\r\n\r\nJDK details:\r\n\r\n- Java               : 1.8\r\n- JVM vendor name    : Private Build\r\n- JVM vendor version : 25.402-b06\r\n- JVM name           : OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM\r\n- JVM version        : 1.8.0_402-8u402-ga-2ubuntu1~22.04-b06\r\n- JVM info           : mixed mode\r\n- OS name            : Linux\r\n- OS version         : 6.5.0-28-generic\r\n\r\nThis issue report only concerns classes of `junit-jupiter-engine-5.11.0-M1.jar`, but there is reason to suspect similar situation with other 5.11.0-M1 artifacts wherever there are synthetic bridge methods.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3797/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
