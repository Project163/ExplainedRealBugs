It practically is the solution that I was looking for in:\r\n\r\n[How specify the behaviour of SpringClassRule/SpringMethodRule for a specific @Test?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39234490/how-specify-the-behaviour-of-springclassrule-springmethodrule-for-a-specific-te)\r\n\r\nThe situation above only happens in `JUnit` **4**\r\n\r\n**Zulu**\r\n\r\nJust curious if the following scenario would be possible in the future (read the comments):\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Transactional\r\n@SpringJUnitConfig(classes={RootApplicationContext.class})\r\n@ActiveProfiles(resolver=TestJdbcActiveProfilesResolver.class)\r\n@TestExecutionListeners(listeners={LoggingTestExecutionListener.class}, mergeMode=MergeMode.MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS)\r\nclass PersonaJdbcRepositoryTest {\r\n\r\n\tprivate static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PersonaJdbcRepositoryTest.class.getSimpleName());\r\n\r\n\tstatic Stream<Persona> data(){\r\n\t\treturn Stream.of(\r\n\t\t\t\tPersonaFactory.crearPersona01(),\r\n\t\t                PersonaFactory.crearPersona02(),\r\n\t\t                PersonaFactory.crearPersona03(),\r\n\t\t                PersonaFactory.crearPersona04(),\r\n\t\t                PersonaFactory.crearPersonaMix());\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n        @MethodSource(\"data\") // Just declared once in the constructor.\r\n\tpublic PersonaJdbcRepositoryTest(Persona persona){\r\n\t\tthis.persona = persona;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@ParameterizedTest\r\n\t//@MethodSource(\"data\") moved to the constructor\r\n\t@Sql(scripts={\"classpath:/com/manuel/jordan/db/delete.sql\"})\r\n\tvoid saveOneTest(){ // Persona persona removed\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t@ParameterizedTest\r\n\t//@MethodSource(\"data\") moved to the constructor\r\n\tvoid updateOneTest(){ // Persona persona removed\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t}\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        @Test // should be executed just one.\r\n\tvoid findAllTest(){\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom above see that _each_ `@MethodSource` now is moved to the constructor *and* `Persona persona` has been removed of each test method marked with `@ParameterizedTest`. I think it is a valuable approach **only** if we have more `@ParameterizedTest` than `@Test`, such as 10/2 or 50/20 .. I hope you see my point.\r\n\r\nThe current approach has sense if we have mixed many `@ParameterizedTest` and `@Test` together, almost equally about of declarations/use of each one, such as the _Omicron_ scenario, 1/1.\r\n\r\nJust sharing ideas and thoughts, I respect a lot the efforts and work of `JUnit`
