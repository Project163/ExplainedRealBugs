Problem\r\n\r\nJUnit's `assertAll()` is widely recommended (e.g. [Baeldung - assertAll() vs Multiple Assertions in JUnit5](https://www.baeldung.com/junit5-assertall-vs-multiple-assertions) and on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40796756/assertall-vs-multiple-assertions-in-junit5)) as a way to group assertions and report all failures at once instead of stopping at the first failure. However, its documented behavior is to _assert that all supplied executables do not throw exceptions._ This is fine for actual test failures, but any **error** (e.g. `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`) is now turned into a test **failure**. This obscures the actual problem; the developer has to look into the `MultipleFailuresError`, realize that the thrown exception is not an `AssertionError` to be able to fix the test programming error (maybe those assertions depend on each other and should be moved out of the `assertAll()`, maybe a null check was forgotten, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\n\r\nI think that `assertAll()` should distinguish between test assertion failures and all other exceptions, and only throw `MultipleFailuresError` if there are test assertion failures, but instead throw a new `MultipleErrorsError` if there's at least one non-assertion exception (programming errors take precedence over test failures). The latter would be reported as a test error, not a test failure, and would contain the original exception(s) as a cause. With that, the behavior would be consistent with the sequential execution of multiple assertions, supporting what I perceive as the predominant use case of `assertAll()` (i.e. executing _all_ assertions and not stopping at the first).\r\n\r\n## Alternative solutions\r\n\r\n* If changing the behavior of `assertAll()` is not an option, a new method a la `assertEach()` could be added that behaves as described above. JavaDocs would have to clearly distinguish between the two methods and explain the difference in behavior. (However, the current behavior of `assertAll()` could be trivially kept by using `assertAll(() -> assertDoesNotThrow(...), ...);`.)\r\n* A lightweight alternative would go without a new `MultipleErrorsError` and just throw the first non-assertion exception (similar to the existing special behavior for unrecoverable exceptions like OOM). Comprehensive failure reporting would only be for failures, not errors, and developers would have to run the test again to see if there are more errors, like in the case of sequential assertions. In fact, the Baeldung article mentioned above (which is based on JUnit 5.9.2) mistakenly assumed that `assertAll()` would behave like this:\r\n\r\n> We should note that `assertAll()` only handles `AssertionError`. If any assertion were to end with an exception, rather than the usual `AssertionError`, execution stops immediately and the error output would relate to the exception, rather than `MultipleFailuresError`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3436/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
