vintage engine currently has a `runtime` scope on JUnit 4. Strictly speaking, I can't argue this is wrong but it has several unpleasant side effects:\r\n\r\n* With Maven, adding the vintage engine in `test`scope means that everything that it brings share that scope (`test`) so `junit` is on the test classpath and all is well.\r\n* Gradle, on the other hand, looks at the scope in transitive dependencies and honours them. Adding the vintage engine in `testCompile` does not bring JUnit 4 to the test compile classpath.\r\n\r\nLooking at your samples, this looks like [an intentional decision](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/6b61ee73aa4e9f860ec7e2e34c025d58a3525a9c/junit5-migration-gradle/build.gradle#L27). \r\n\r\nWould it be possible to remove that scope from the vintage engine so that the story is more consistent between those two build systems? The same way we've asked you to add `junit-jupiter` to have one library that brings the necessary bits, I'd argue that adding the vintage engine should bring me the necessary bits to compile/run tests using JUnit 4.\r\n\r\nWe didn't notice this problem immediately when we migrated Spring Boot to JUnit 5. We've taken the decision [to add junit 4 explicitly in our starter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/16807) to make sure gradle-based projects are not broken on upgrade. Doing so makes it harder to switch purely to JUnit 5 as [two dependencies have to be excluded now](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/81af0f2fa672d962d4c8569b6b7ee802008717c2#diff-3034c859fdf54b18876462585532bd82R6822).","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1872/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
