Overview\r\n\r\nAssume you viewed the [Release Notes for JUnit 5.10.0](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.10.0/release-notes/index.html#bug-fixes) when it was the `current` release and copied the link to `Bug Fixes` under JUnit Jupiter.\r\n\r\nYou would then have copied the following link.\r\n\r\n- https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/release-notes/index.html#bug-fixes\r\n\r\nIf you had pasted that into documentation, on Stack Overflow, etc., that link will now bring you to the `Bug Fixes` section for the JUnit Platform in 5.10.1.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we don't have any \"permalink\" support currently.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of `https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/release-notes/index.html#bug-fixes`, we should generate a link to `https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/release-notes/index.html#release-notes-5.10.0-junit-jupiter-bug-fixes` with an anchor of `#release-notes-5.10.0-junit-jupiter-bug-fixes` instead of just `#bug-fixes`.\r\n\r\nNote that this should address permalinks with the `current` version as well as in the current `5.10.x` set of versions. Though, it obviously will not provide any kind of permalink to previous versions of the framework such as `5.9.x`. In any case, it's still an improvement.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure that subsections -- `Bug Fixes`, `Deprecations and Breaking Changes`, and `New Features and Improvements` -- are assigned anchors associated with the current module and release.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3639/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
