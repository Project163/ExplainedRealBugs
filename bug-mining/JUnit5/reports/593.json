Overview\r\n\r\nAnalogous to #2993 `ReflectionUtils.findFields()` can return duplicate fields, breaking certain use cases.\r\n\r\nIn general, this can happen if an interface defines a field and a type hierarchy implements that same interface multiple times.\r\n\r\nIn JUnit Jupiter, this can result in a `static` `@TempDir` field from an interface being processed twice.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nGiven the following types, searching for `static` fields in `SubclassWithFieldAndFieldFromInterface` finds the `interfacePath` field twice.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface InterfaceWithField {\r\n\r\n\tString interfacePath = \"ifc\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass SuperclassWithFieldAndFieldFromInterface implements InterfaceWithField {\r\n\r\n\tstatic final String superPath = \"super\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass SubclassWithFieldAndFieldFromInterface extends SuperclassWithFieldAndFieldFromInterface\r\n\t\timplements InterfaceWithField {\r\n\r\n\tstatic final String subPath = \"sub\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #2993 \r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure `ReflectionUtils.findFields()` returns distinct fields\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
