Overview\n\nWhile working on #4716, by merely inspecting the code I theorized that there must be something wrong with how `useHeadersInDisplayName` works. So, I wrote an example and confirmed it.\n\nSpecifically, when I introduced the `useHeadersInDisplayName` support for `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource` in JUnit Jupiter 5.8.2, I used a _hack_ to create the \"header name = argument value\" entries in the display names using `Named`.\n\nUnfortunately, that hack only works with the `{arguments}` display name pattern.\n\nThus, the [examples in the User Guide](https://docs.junit.org/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-CsvSource) explicitly declare that as follows.\n\n```java\n@ParameterizedTest(name = \"[{index}] {arguments}\")\n@CsvSource(useHeadersInDisplayName = true, textBlock = \"\"\"\n    FRUIT,         RANK\n    apple,         1\n    banana,        2\n    'lemon, lime', 0xF1\n    strawberry,    700_000\n    \"\"\")\nvoid testWithCsvSource(String fruit, int rank) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat results in display names like `[1] FRUIT = apple, RANK = 1`, which is the desired result.\n\nHowever, if you simply declare `@ParameterizedTest`, without specifying an alternative `name` pattern, that results in display names like `[1] fruit=FRUIT = apple, rank=RANK = 1`, which is obviously not the desired result. This is due to the fact that `<parameter name>=` is prepended to the argument value (or name-value pair as is the case for `useHeadersInDisplayName`).\n\nAside from the fact that we obviously have different formatting for the two features (`x=y` vs. `x = y`), we should ensure that the `useHeadersInDisplayName` feature works properly when using the default display name pattern (or one equivalent to `{argumentsWithNames}`.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #2767\n- #4716\n- #4804\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4783/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
