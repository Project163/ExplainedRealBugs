Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). -->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExecuting the following test results in an exception:\r\n```\r\njava.io.IOException: Failed to delete temp directory C:\\tmp\\junit3857951443644498861. The following paths could not be deleted (see suppressed exceptions for details): \r\n[...]\r\n\tSuppressed: java.nio.file.DirectoryNotEmptyException: C:\\tmp\\junit3857951443644498861\r\n```\r\n\t\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class DirTest {\r\n\r\n\t@TempDir\r\n\tPath temp;\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tpublic void foo() throws MultipleFailuresError, IOException {\r\n\t\tPath dir = temp.resolve(\"dir\");\r\n\t\tFiles.createDirectories(dir);\r\n\t\tFiles.createFile(dir.resolve(\"file\"));\r\n\t\tassertAll(Files.list(dir).map(f -> () -> {}));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDebugging shows that `file` can be deleted while `dir` remains existent even after a successful call to `Files#delete` ([TempDirectory](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/cfdf09aad5ed70fae210fe14fad6d6356f749242/junit-jupiter-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/extension/TempDirectory.java#L206))\r\n\r\nI suspect there is something within `assertAll` interfering with deleting the directory. Can anyone confirm this behaviour or propose a solution?\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n - JUnit-Version: org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.6.2\r\n - Build Tool/IDE: Eclipse
