Overview\r\n\r\nThe stream received by a @TestFactory method should be closed after all the tests have been run.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you wish to create dynamic tests based on the data from file, you cannot call the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@TestFactory\r\nStream<DynamicText> pointTests() {\r\n    return\r\n        Files.lines(fileName).map(Point::parse).map(\r\n            point -> dynamicTest(\"Testing \" + p, () -> pointTest(p))\r\n        );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nbecause the stream represented by `Files.lines()` is a file-system-based resource and must be closed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we cannot just use\r\n```\r\n@TestFactory\r\nStream<DynamicText> pointTests() {\r\n{\r\n    try (final Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(fileName)) {\r\n    return\r\n        lines.map(Point::parse).map(\r\n            point -> dynamicTest(\"Testing \" + p, () -> pointTest(p)))\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nas the source stream is closed **before** JUnit5 even starts reading from it (the termination operation is lazy).\r\n\r\nThe only solution currently is probably only using an interim collection and collect the lines to it, which is awkward:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@TestFactory\r\nStream<DynamicText> pointTests() {\r\n    final List<Point> data;\r\n    try (final Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(fileName)) {\r\n        data = lines.map(Point::parse).collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n    );\r\n    return data.map(point -> dynamicTest(\"Testing \" + p, () -> pointTest(p));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**It would be most convenient if the contract of @TestFactory guaranteed calling Stream#close().**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nIt is crucial that all the related documentation states that the stream is closed, so it becomes part of the contract and the clients may rely on it.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
