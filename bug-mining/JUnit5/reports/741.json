Overview\n\nAs I mentioned in #4783, name-argument pairs in display names for parameterized classes and tests have different formatting/spacing depending on the use case.\n\nWhen using `useHeadersInDisplayName` with `@CsvSource` or `@CsvFileSource`, they take the form `name = value`; whereas, when using the `{argumentsWithNames}` display name pattern, they take the form `name=value` (without spaces).\n\nAfter discussing this within the team, we decided to consistently use the `name = value` formatting.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4716\n-
