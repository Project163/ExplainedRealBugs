While it was quite easy to implement this with the given APIs (besides the parallelization, it just used 99% of the jupiter-engine for everything else), I have found it a bit tricky to find out which TestNode is represented by each TestTask (could have used reflection, but used another trick).\n\nI know this a very uncommon scenario, but would anything speak against simply adding a getTestDescriptor method to the TestTask to make usecases like this a bit easier?\nI don't think there is anything wrong with this, as the TestTask always represents a TestNode which basically will always have a matching Descriptor, at least when I look at the default implementation shipped with junit. To avoid breaking changes it could be a default implementation which just throws an UnsupportedOperationException if not implemented.\n\nThanks in advance and keep up the good work, JUnit5 is really a great testing framework!\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Add `TestTask.getTestDescriptor()` method\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
