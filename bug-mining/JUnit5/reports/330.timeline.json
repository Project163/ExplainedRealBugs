extensions registered programmatically via `@RegisterExtension` will be ordered using an algorithm that is deterministic but intentionally nonobvious. This ensures that subsequent runs of a test suite execute extensions in the same order, thereby allowing for repeatable builds. However, there are times when extensions need to be registered in an explicit order. To achieve that, annotate each `@RegisterExtension` field with `@Order`. Any `@RegisterExtension` field not annotated with `@Order` will appear at the end of the sorted

https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/48#issuecomment-463456291 (and following comment)\r\n\r\nUsing JUnit5 with Spring Cloud Contract (SCC), I noticed this behavior in 2.1.0:\r\n- Naming a contract (YAML) with a numeric prefix triggers code generation failure, with the message \"Not implemented yet in JUnit5 - https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/48\"\r\n\r\nI tracked it down to https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/blob/8ce80e6e7fc0267a9cba1679bdf20f42ce875741/spring-cloud-contract-verifier/src/main/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/config/framework/JUnit5Definition.groovy#L63.\r\n\r\nInitially I posted to the issue link in the message, but find it's really a SCC issue, not a JUnit one.\r\n\r\nJUnit 5.4 provides an experimental annotation, `@TestMethodOrder`, with 3 interesting policies:\r\n- Run tests in alphanumeric order based on generated method name\r\n- Run tests in random order\r\n- Run tests in user-specified order using the `@Order` annotation on each test method\r\n\r\nIs there any mechanism for YAML format whereby I can ask for annotations on the SCC-generated methods, or possibly on the generated test class?\r\n\r\n`@TestMethodOrder` is marked `@Inherited`, so I'm trying out placing it on my test base class, but am encountering issues (Spring framework is behaving oddly, having problems with classpath and loading the context.)\r\n\r\nMy sample project is
