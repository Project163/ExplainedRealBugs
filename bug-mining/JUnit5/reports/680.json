Overview\n\nA `DisplayNameGenerator` can access the type of a `@Nested` test class as well as the enclosing class in which a `@Nested` test class is declared, but it cannot access the concrete runtime type of the enclosing instance for a `@Nested` test class.\n\nWhen a `DisplayNameGenerator` is used to build hierarchical display names, this can lead to confusing results or even conflicting results depending on the structure of the test classes used, \"conflicting\" in the sense that two nested test classes may have identical display names that do not represent the runtime structure of the test classes.\n\n## Example\n\n```java\n@IndicativeSentencesGeneration\nabstract class AbstractBaseTests {\n\n\t@Nested\n\tclass NestedTests {\n\n\t\t@Test\n\t\tvoid test() {\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n```java\nclass ScenarioOneTests extends AbstractBaseTests {\n}\n```\n\n```java\nclass ScenarioTwoTests extends AbstractBaseTests {\n}\n```\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nWhen running `ScenarioOneTests` and `ScenarioTwoTests`, we currently see the following display names.\n\n- `ScenarioOneTests`\n  - `AbstractBaseTests, NestedTests`\n    - `AbstractBaseTests, NestedTests, test()`\n- `ScenarioTwoTests`\n  - `AbstractBaseTests, NestedTests`\n    - `AbstractBaseTests, NestedTests, test()`\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen running `ScenarioOneTests` and `ScenarioTwoTests`, we would expect the following display names.\n\n- `ScenarioOneTests`\n  - `ScenarioOneTests, NestedTests`\n    - `ScenarioOneTests, NestedTests, test()`\n- `ScenarioTwoTests`\n  - `ScenarioTwoTests, NestedTests`\n    - `ScenarioTwoTests, NestedTests, test()`\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4131 \n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [x] Ensure that a `DisplayNameGenerator` can access the concrete runtime type of the enclosing instance for a `@Nested` test class.\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
