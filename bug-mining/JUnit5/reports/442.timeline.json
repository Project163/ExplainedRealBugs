Marc Philipp implemented the `@TempDir` extension in Pioneer, it was later also added to Jupiter. It didn't (and as of September 2020 doesn't) support custom file systems, but other than that is more feature-rich than Pioneer's variant. This creates an unpleasant situation where there are two extensions that solve the same problem with the same approach, but slightly different feature sets (and an identical name to boot).\r\n\r\nThat said, there are a lot of feature requests for Jupiter's variant (⚠️ _some of these are already implemented!_ ⚠️):\r\n\r\n* [Multiple declarations of `@TempDir` in same parameter list or class declaration should fail](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2219)\r\n* [Support @TempDir on constructor parameters](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1754)\r\n* [Introduce cleanup mode in @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1814)\r\n* [Multiple @TempDirs should result in multiple directories](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1967)\r\n* [Provide support for setting a custom parent directory for @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2088)\r\n* [Support disabling cleanup for @TempDir](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2159)\r\n* [Support custom file system for `@TempDir`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2400)\r\n* [Make `@TempDir` restore mint permissions before closing context to avoid `AccessDeniedException`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2609)\r\n\r\nAfter evaluating the situation in #277, we decided to remove the extension before the 1.0 release with the goal to look for a better solution to the problem in the future (i.e. this issue). So the task is to come up with a temporary directory (or, more generally temporary resource) extension that covers _more_ than what Jupiter does, possibly with an approach that makes different trade-offs (so users of Jupiter and Pioneer have more choices to solve their specific problem).\r\n\r\nOne interesting proof of concept to look at is @sormuras': [1](https://github.com/sormuras/brahms#temporary-directory-as-resource), [2](https://github.com/sormuras/brahms/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/resource/ChickenAndEggTests.java)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/348/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer/issues/348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/841904430","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2609#issuecomment-841904430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2609","id":841904430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MTkwNDQzMA==","user":{"login":"Philzen","id":1634615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ2MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen","html_url":"https://github.com/Philzen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-17T00:26:27Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T00:27:12Z","body":"Thanks for the clarification @marcphilipp – i upgraded to 5.7.2 now and can confirm that the above code works like a charm and resets writable permissions of the `@tempDir` itself as well as contained directories (note to self - when picking this up, i should also test for 2nd-level directories). Hence i could already remove cruft code for those tests cases, very nice indeed :smile: \r\n\r\nHowever i can confirm that the issue description holds true, as not only the executable-flag needs to be restored, but also the readable-flag.

& others i've written the tests for the above matrix and added them in e8c1f5217c. Then i tried to piggyback on to the `makeWritableAndTryToDeleteAgain` (making it effectively a `resetPermissionsAndTryToDeleteAgain` method) in 6df322747a.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem seems to be that for all test cases throwing an `AccessDeniedException` as seen in the test matrix above, they never throw an `IOException` (as a matter of fact, no `Exception` at all) in the `deleteAndContinue`-method of the `SimpleFileVisitor`, so fixing permissions at that point in the flow doesn't do the job. You can debug yourself if you enable the tests i created in e8c1f5217c, then set a breakpoint where the `IOException` is caught ([Line 211](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/pull/2624/commits/45563030855676b112847b05dad5df109fae61b3#diff-3f71fb375a592361209258d7aacc6786cc8009617db497c5bcf19ec467cfc6e2R211) and you'll find that it only gets reached 11 times – these are the 11 successful cases in column one of the test case matrix above.\r\n\r\nGiven the current test framework it's hard to find the underlying cause as that is hidden from the stack trace. When i run those tests from an external project i get the following stack trace (which is the same for any of those `AccessDeniedException`-giving test cases):\r\n\r\n```\r\nMai 24, 2021 2:24:08 AM

awesome, thanks for help! I will try to squash my non-functional commit into yours so we merge only working commits into the main history.\r\n\r\nWhat i was thinking is: Now that the restoring of file & folder permissions will done *before* `deleteAndContinue` is called, the whole `makeWritableAndTryToDeleteAgain` thing introduced in ee5c45f4 become superfluous, correct? The only change that i'd see worth keeping is catching any exceptions around `Files.delete(path);` and adding them to the failures list.\r\n\r\nIf you agree i would also craft a cleanup commit on top – technically the tests introduced for #2046 should warn us anyway providing there is also a windows vm running the ci pipelines.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/850388497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Philzen","id":1634615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzQ2MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1634615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen","html_url":"https://github.com/Philzen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Philzen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
