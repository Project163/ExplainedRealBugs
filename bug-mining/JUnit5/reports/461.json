Overview\r\n\r\nThanks to the tip from @DidierLoiseau (see https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1602#issuecomment-891077168), I have confirmed that the changes made in #1602 should also be applied in `org.junit.vintage.engine.execution.TestRun.getStoredResultOrSuccessful(TestDescriptor)`.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `org.junit.internal.runners.model.EachTestNotifier.addMultipleFailureException(MultipleFailureException)` invokes `org.junit.runner.notification.RunNotifier.fireTestFailure(Failure)` for each failure in the supplied `org.junit.runners.model.MultipleFailureException`.\r\n\r\nThis can happen if you are using the JUnit 4 `ErrorCollector` rule.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Add suppressed exceptions to the `MultipleFailuresError` created in the Vintage `TestRun`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2693/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
