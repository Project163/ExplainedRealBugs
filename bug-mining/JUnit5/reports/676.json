Goal\r\nAdd support for some level of parallelization inside the Junit Vintage engine.\r\nIdeally the level of configuration should be similar to maven surefire parallel options.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\nWhen including junit 5 tests in a project containing junit4 tests the natural path is to use junit 5 platform with the jupiter and vintage engines.\r\n\r\nHowever this causes problem with parallelization. \r\nIn a project with Junit4 tests only maven surefire level parallelization works fine. (See https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html).\r\nFor Junit5 tests the jupiter engine [parallel execution works great](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution). \r\n\r\nHowever when a project contains a mix of Junit4 and Junit 5 there is no great way to configure parallelism:\r\n* Surefire parallel does not work with Junit Platform Provider so it's not an option\r\n* Surefire forkCount or gradle maxParallelForks can be used but:\r\n  * It's not available at all when using  [tycho surefire](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire-plugin/plugin-info.html)\r\n  * It introduces some memory and execution time overhead compared to surefire parallel or junit 5 parallel.\r\n  * It provides less control than Junit 5 parallel execution options.\r\n* Combining fork + junit 5 parallel execution leads to more parallel executions than expected  when executing junit 5 tests because parallelization is done at two level.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to configure two distinct test tasks one for junit 4 using surefire parallel and one for junit 5 but it kind of defeats the point of junit platform.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] Not sure\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2229/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
