in the process of upgrading our parallel test setup to JUnit5. My JUnit4 surefire configuration looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <parallel>classes</parallel>\r\n    <threadCount>1</threadCount>\r\n    <perCoreThreadCount>true</perCoreThreadCount>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this configuration, test classes run in parallel but individual test methods within a class run within the same thread (see [Surefire Docs](\r\nhttps://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html)).\r\n\r\nI tried to emulate this behavior with `@Execution(ExecutionMode.SAME_THREAD)` on my test classes. But as discussed on Gitter, this actually causes the test and all its method to run in the same thread as the test classes parent node which is the test engine.\r\n\r\n@marcphilipp suggested two possible workarounds:\r\n- you could put the annotation on each test method but that's probably overkill\r\n- you could put all your test methods into `@Nested` classes and use `@Execution(ExecutionMode.SAME_THREAD)` on the nested class\r\n\r\nBoth workarounds are quite invasive and not very intuitive for authors of new tests.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we had an additional execution mode that runs only test classes in parallel or if `@Execution(ExecutionMode.SAME_THREAD)` on test classes could be adapted to do that.","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1682/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
