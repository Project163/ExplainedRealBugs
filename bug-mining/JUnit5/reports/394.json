provides a nice way to configure test names, however, the names might become too long unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nHere's a case for JUnit4:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/aa190cce2c27ac5f5d4fa33f5d156f8bf04cbe0c/pgjdbc/src/test/java/org/postgresql/core/UTF8EncodingTest.java#L29-L33\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Parameterized.Parameters(name = \"string={1}, encoding={0}\")\r\n  public static Iterable<Object[]> data() {\r\n    final StringBuilder reallyLongString = new StringBuilder(1024 * 1024);\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < 185000; ++i) {\r\n      reallyLongString.append(i);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the same is relevant for JUnit5 as well.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if JUnit could detect such cases, and it could trim the sub-parts before it produces a single multi-megabyte test name.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the case like above JUnit could produce something like `string=012345678910111213...truncated...sha1=12312312123, encoding=utf-8`\r\n\r\nIt turns out the long test names consume disk space as Gradle records all the test outputs, and it does make `remote build cache` slower, as the build cache has to keep all the long test names (so it impacts `cache space consumption`, `cache store latency` and `cache retrieval latency`).\r\n\r\nOf course, users can truncate test names on their own, however, I believe it would be better if JUnit prevented \"unexpectedly long test name\" issue automatically.\r\n\r\nIn other words:\r\n\r\n1) If use is using placeholder-like pattern, then JUnit should trim all the parameters.\r\n2) If the user returns test name via programmatic API (I'm not sure if that exists at all, but I assume it does :) ), then JUnit could truncate the full string.\r\n3) There should probably be a configuration option for the default limit of the parameter value.\r\n\r\nWDYT?\r\n\r\nRelevant Gradle Build Cache issue:
