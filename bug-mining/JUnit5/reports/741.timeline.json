Overview\n\nWhile discussing #4714 with @sormuras, he inquired about the `'null'` display name, which sparked an idea...\n\nNamely, it would be quite nice to have an auto-quote feature for argument values in the display name for a `@ParameterizedClass` or `@ParameterizedTest`.\n\nI therefore propose that we introduce a `boolean quoteText() default true` attribute (or similar) in `@ParameterizedClass` and `@ParameterizedTest` which signals to the `ParameterizedInvocationNameFormatter` that it should wrap `CharSequence` values (naturally including `String`) in double quotes (`\"\"`) and wrap Character` values in single quotes (`''`).\n\nDefaulting to `true` would make this an opt-out feature, but we could of course default to `false` to make it an opt-in feature.\n\nThough, since we are introducing this in 6.0, perhaps it's better to make it an opt-out feature.\n\nNote, however, that a `null` `CharSequence`/`Character` value would continue to be displayed as `null`, not `\"null\"` or `'null'`.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #4714 \n- #4783 \n- #4786

Background\n\nWhile working on #4698, I created tests using _blank_ strings like the following.\n\n```java\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n@ParameterizedTest\n@NullSource\n@ValueSource(strings = { \"\", \" \", \"   \", \"\\t\", \"\\r\", \"\\r\\n\", \"\\n\" })\n@interface EmptyReasonsTest {\n}\n```\n\nThat produces display names similar to the following, which are not very useful since the last 7 are identical.\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bd17797-7d6d-497b-b99a-4f4ec5fb046b\" />\n\nIf I wrap the values in single quotes as follows...\n\n```java\n@ParameterizedTest(name = \"[{index}] reason=''{0}''\")\n```\n\n... the results are better.\n\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Image\"

In the-spirit-of-short-test-names I'd be happy if the above test result would be displayed like this ...\n```java\n├─ JUnit Jupiter ✔\n│  └─ DemoTest ✔\n│     └─ multipleArgs(String, String, int) ✔\n│        ├─ [1] text=short spacing=\" \" number=23 ✔\n│        └─ [2] text=\"long text\" spacing=\"\" number=42 ✔\n```\n\n... where quotation is only applied where necessary.\n\nI realize the above quotes-where-necessary layout is not in the cards for the 6.0.0 release. However, in the short run I think it'd better to replace the boolean `quoteTextArguments` attribute with an enum type attribute and therewith have the API compatible with future layouts on top of just true and false. Initial constants on enum could perhaps be `RELEASE_6_DEFAULT, RELEASE_5_ORIGINAL` and then the future is allowed to present additional constants to achieve `AS_IN_CSV_SOURCE` or `ONLY_AS_NEEDED_FOR_achieving_something` - but hopefully with somewhat better constant names :-)\n\nIn the long run I also believe it'd be good to support customized separation between parameters (e.g. `\" \"` instead of `\", \"`) and between name & value (e.g. `\"=\"` instead of `\" = \"`).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/3153815964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kaipe","id":364248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDI0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/364248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe","html_url":"https://github.com/kaipe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaipe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/3154086006","html_url":"https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4786#issuecomment-3154086006","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4786","id":3154086006,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAbwRH867_4h2","user":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-05T08:27:52Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T08:27:52Z","body":"Thanks for the additional feedback, @kaipe.\n\nI had actually already considered only quoting \"when necessary\", and I had also considered introducing a `String` attribute to allow the user to define the parameter name-value separator with `\" = \"` as the default.\n\nAs for deciding if quoting is necessary, I suppose the logic would be to only quote if:\n\n- something was escaped, or\n- the text is empty, or\n- the text contains whitespace (such as normal spaces)\n\nPlease note, however, that we only quote text-based source arguments. For example, if a source argument is an `Integer`, the value in the display name will not be quoted. The reason you're seeing `number = \"23\"` here is that the source is from a CSV record, which is always text-based.\n\nIn any case, _this_ issue is closed.
