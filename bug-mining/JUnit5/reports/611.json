Status Quo\r\n\r\nThe `NamespacedHierarchicalStore` doesn't track its state. Currently it is possible to call `put()` or any other modifying action after the store has already been closed via `close()`, allowing for potential misuse and bugs to creep in unknowingly.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAny modification or query after `close()` should result in an `IllegalStateException` or similar. The method `close()` should be idempotent: any subsequent call to `close()` should effectively be a no-op.\r\n\r\n## Deliverables\r\n\r\n- [x] `NamespacedHierarchicalStore` tracks its active/closed state\r\n- [x] `NamespacedHierarchicalStore` throws an exception for modification or query calls after it has been closed\r\n- [x] `NamespacedHierarchicalStore.close()` is idempotent\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3614/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
