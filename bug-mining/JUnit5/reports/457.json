feature, not a platform one. \r\n\r\nI think something like: \r\n\r\n> Jupiter test classes and methods can be tagged via the `@Tag` annotation. Other engines can support different ways like for example category annotation or configuration file or naming convention or cyclomatic complexity of a method or data about previous runs and so on. The engine translates whatever means it sees fit to a platform tag on which you then can filter.\r\n\r\n(source https://github.com/spockframework/spock/issues/1288#issuecomment-792136881)\r\n\r\nwould make it much more clear.
