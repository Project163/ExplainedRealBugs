I originally implemented it this way to avoid passing the wrong `TestSource` to the `TestDescriptor` for cases like the following (from our test suite):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/5e41ebe612fd67e905f96f1dd3184a071b65be17/junit-vintage-engine/src/test/java/org/junit/vintage/engine/samples/junit4/JUnit4TestCaseWithOverloadedMethod.java#L29-L37\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `Description` object that we get from JUnit 4 is basically the String `theory(org.junit.vintage.engine.samples.junit4.JUnit4TestCaseWithOverloadedMethod)` which we cannot use to differentiate between the two methods. So, instead of choosing one at random, I decided to bail out and just use the `ClassSource`. The intention of the `TestSource` API was and still is mainly to allow for navigation to the source code in IDEs.\r\n\r\nI guess we could apply a few heuristics to the method lookup.
