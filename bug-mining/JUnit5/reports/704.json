Please provide us the version of JUnit 5 you are using and, if possible, a failing unit test with your bug report. Don't forget to describe the rationale for this issue (e.g. expected vs. actual behavior). Please also mention where it's a regression compared to a previous version. -->\n\nIn our test suite we’ve noticed that if any test fails (for whatever reason), then a lot of subsequent tests fail due to out-of-disk problems. This disk space is taken by temporary JUnit directories ([`org.junit.jupiter.api.io.TempDir`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/main/junit-jupiter-api/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/io/TempDir.java)). We use `junit.jupiter.tempdir.cleanup.mode.default=ON_SUCCESS` property, so theoretically only directories for failed tests should be preserved, but we also see many directories for successful ones.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll temporary directories of successful tests should be deleted. It worked this way in `5.10.0`.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nIf one test fails, then temporary directories of subsequent successful tests are preserved. First observed in `5.10.1`.\n\nI think it was introduced in https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/3510 . Looks like [`selfOrChildFailed`](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/c83bfbc7e2739baae273051de79473b2e3ed640c/junit-jupiter-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/extension/TempDirectory.java#L330-L335) starts treating all subsequent tests as failed.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n<!-- Please insert a code snippet or a link to another repo along with instructions how to reproduce the issue here. The example should be minimal, complete and verifiable (see https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). -->\n\nI’ve put a minimal reproducible example in this repository: https://github.com/msulima/junit-tmpdir-cleanup\n\n## Context\n\n - JUnit: 5.10.1, 5.11.0, 5.12.1\n - Maven 3.9.9 + surefire 3.3.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
