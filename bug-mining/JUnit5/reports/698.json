Issue\r\n\r\nExtension methods all have `ExtensionContext` which provides us many useful information like `displayname`, `method` or `tags`. This helps  in writing custom test reports.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm missing is a way to get argument instances of a `@ParameterizedTest`. When not running tests extended by a `ParameterResolver` using `ExtensionContext.Store` you can only make a workaround to get a clue of what arguments were used for the test:\r\n\r\n- Filter displayname (objects need to override `toString()` for important informations)\r\n- get values from annotations\r\n\r\nIf parameters are simple strings, integers etc. there is no problem when parsing displayname. The problem starts when one of the parameters is an object containing lots of informations. A new instance would have to be created when analyzing the test, but this doesn't garanty an object with exact the same content like in the test and might also lead to memory issues.\r\n\r\nMost simple way is to reimplement Parameterized Test Template, extend from each class, catch resolved parameters and store them directly in ExtensionContext.Store, but I'm not a fan of writing Wrapper classes for such small extensions in existing codes.\r\n\r\n## Possible Suggestions\r\n\r\n- Provide a method `Arguments[] ExtensionContext.getArguments()` or `List<Arguments> ExtensionContext.getArguments()` which returns a list of all Arguments used for the test (empty list if no arguments were used).\r\n- Store arguments in `ExtensionContext.Store` with a predefined namespace in your `ParameterizedTestParameterResolver` class (then there is no need to do it in custom `ArgumentsProvider` classes)\r\n- Provide an Extension interface which is called between `BeforeTestExecutionCallback` and `@Test`. As parameters it should have `ExtensionContext` and `Arguments[]`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\n- #944\r\n- #1668\r\n- #1884\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1139/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/1139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
