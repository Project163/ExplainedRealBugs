It should not \"supersede\" that support.\r\n\r\nThat's why I suggested a robust and backward compatible solution based on schemes (a.k.a., _prefixes_) such as `classpath:` and `file:`, where `classpath:` is the inferred default.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I understand your preference for placing resources directly in the file system. There may be valid use cases for that. That's why I asked you to open this issue (And thanks for doing so!); however, I don't agree with the following.\r\n\r\n> so getting the resources into the class path in typical builds needs help from the build system\r\n\r\nMost projects I have seen over the past decade use Maven or Gradle (or some other build tool) that supports the de facto standard for classpath resources (i.e., the `src/main/resources` and `src/test/resources` folders). IDEs also fully support the notion of test classpath resources. Furthermore, there are times when classpath resources are the only option -- for example, when test support is published as a JAR file in which both the compiled classes and classpath resources must be present.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/comments/621878838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3289649647,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzI4OTY0OTY0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/events/3289649647","actor":{"login":"sbrannen","id":104798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen","html_url":"https://github.com/sbrannen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbrannen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-30T14:17:36Z","rename":{"from":"Read

Studying the scheme like proposal\r\n\r\n- Considering to implement a URI like schema. Studying the URL and URI doc, I found that \r\nusing proper url like https://junit5.org will work and produce a reasonable resource specifying string.\r\nHowever, using the `file://` only allows full path names like '  file:/home/hom/NetBeansProjects/uriresolution/target/classes/u/u.csv' which of course would be a **no go**, because that would bind the project to a specific file system organization. The class loader resolution which is still intact will deal with the class path, presumably the module path and the jar path too. \r\n\r\n- The order of evaluation might need some consideration because in case of having two resources on in the project with the same name will give the first one evaluated precedence. On the business side of a project, I could imagine that this leads to unsafe situations because a local file could overwrite a constant in a jar. On the other hand, having an almost automatic overwrite mechanism in the testing part of a project might be beneficial. In that case, giving file system resolution precedence over class-loader resolution might be acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> As I stated in [#1970 (comment)](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1970#issuecomment-621727776), we likely will **not** want to change the default semantics since that would be a potentially breaking change.\r\n\r\nI am NOT proposing to change the default semantics. Default is what will happen if a file is not resolvable via the Path.get() method, and that default is then the class loader resolving. The added tests in the pull request may help to convince that there will be little breakage if any.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Instead, adding support for looking in the file system would be \"in addition\" to the current classpath support. It should not \"supersede\" that support.\r\n> \r\n> That's why I suggested a robust and backward compatible solution based on schemes (a.k.a., _prefixes_) such as `classpath:` and `file:`, where `classpath:` is the inferred default.\r\n> \r\n\r\nThe file: prefix may lead to quite some confusion because that will not support a relative path, which is what you typically want.\r\n\r\n> As a side note, I understand your preference for placing resources directly in the file system. There may be valid use cases for that. That's why I asked you to open this issue (And thanks for doing so!); however, I don't agree with the following.\r\n> \r\n> > so getting the resources into the class path in typical builds needs help from the build system\r\n> \r\n> Most projects I have seen over the past decade use Maven or Gradle (or some other build tool) that supports the de facto standard for classpath resources (i.e., the `src/main/resources` and `src/test/resources` folders). IDEs also fully support the notion of test classpath resources. Furthermore, there are times when classpath resources are the only option -- for example, when test support is published as a JAR file in which both the compiled classes and classpath resources must be present.\r\n\r\nLoading the resource via the class loader will still be supported. This proposal does not want to supplant but only enhance the current implementation. The last use case you describe is still supported and even improved, because with a test-jar you could simply add test cases to the csv file, by making a copy of the csv file in the jar, and adding your test cases. This will only make the case for this enhancement stronger. In that scenario, one must of course take care of proper file naming and potential sub directories a.k.a. namespaces for the test resource files.

Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe your changes here and list any open questions you might have. -->\r\n\r\nEnhance the way CsvFileSource resolves its resources by searching the file system for the named resource in addition to resolving it via the class loader of the test class, which is the current implementation. The following benefits will be provided:\r\n\r\n- In case of sub classes in different packages (#1970) this will be a no brainer. In that case specifying the test class as `src/test/resources/testEquals.csv` would solve that whole issue.\r\n- Resource resolution will have two steps: file system first, then default to class loader resolution. In case test cases are deployed by jar file, one gets the added benefit of being able to _overwrite_ the test data by supplying a file with the same path and file name as the test data file in the deployment artifact.\r\n- Test data classes no longer need to be copied around if the file system resolving is used. This may be a minor issue unless files are big and/or you worry about storage hardware wear.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI hereby agree to the terms of the [JUnit Contributor License
