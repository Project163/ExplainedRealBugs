and I just hit this while migrating an internal project to JUnit5, it seems quite surprising behaviour to have multiple parameters point to the same directory on disk!\r\n\r\nThe old JUnit4 code used the `TemporaryFolder#newFolder` method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Before\r\npublic void before() {\r\n  Path dir1 = temporaryFolder.newFolder().toPath();\r\n  Path dir2 = temporaryFolder.newFolder().toPath();\r\n  foo = new Foo(dir1, dir2);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI _thought_ this could just be replaced by using multiple parameters, but as this issue describes both dir1 and dir2 ended up pointing to the same directory, so the test failed in weird and wonderful ways.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@BeforeEach\r\npublic void beforeEach(@TempDir Path dir1, @TempDir Path dir2) { //
