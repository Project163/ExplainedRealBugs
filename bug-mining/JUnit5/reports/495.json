the `MethodSource` methods are supposed to not have any parameters, however, it'll help to have parameters to be resolved in these methods if registered similar to Before/After methods.\r\n\r\nAlong with #2190, this will give access to `MethodSource` methods to possibly use `Extension.Store` and store any initialized details, which could be purged in `@AfterAll` methods\r\n\r\nAlso, in case of creating dynamic tests using details from a resolved Object, `ParameterResolver` can enhance abilities of `MethodSource` by a fair bit.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the way to achieve the same is to have a class implementing `ArgumentsProvider` and possibly manage the value of the object there, or have it in the `MethodSource` method itself statically initializing it in test class.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"juliette-derancourt","id":28359762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzU5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28359762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt","html_url":"https://github.com/juliette-derancourt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/2191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
