Jupiter and Vintage engines use `org.junit.platform.commons.util.ClasspathScanner` to discover test classes in the classpath. The `ClasspathScanner` scans directories and looks for class files. It works fine for a standard JVM process; however, it needs to be customized for a specific environment such as Android.\r\n\r\nA possible solution for this is to make the `ClasspathScanner` an interface and load the implementation via the `ServiceLoader` mechanism.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface ClasspathScanner {\r\n\tstatic ClasspathScanner getInstance() {\r\n\t\tServiceLoader<ClasspathScanner> serviceLoader = ServiceLoader.load(ClasspathScanner.class);\r\n\t\tfor (ClasspathScanner scanner : serviceLoader) {\r\n\t\t\treturn scanner;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn new DefaultClasspathScanner(ClassLoaderUtils::getDefaultClassLoader, ReflectionUtils::tryToLoadClass);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tList<Class<?>> scanForClassesInPackage(String basePackageName, ClassFilter classFilter);\r\n\r\n\tList<Class<?>> scanForClassesInClasspathRoot(URI root, ClassFilter classFilter);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we could provide the Android-specific implementation with [`androidx.test.internal.runner.ClassPathScanner`](https://github.com/android/android-test/blob/main/runner/android_junit_runner/java/androidx/test/internal/runner/ClassPathScanner.java), for example.\r\n\r\nThis change would make the Jupiter and Vintage engines work in Android.","closed_by":{"login":"juliette-derancourt","id":28359762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzU5NzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28359762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt","html_url":"https://github.com/juliette-derancourt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliette-derancourt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3628/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/3628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
