Overview\n\nIn the test suite for the Spring Framework, we have a [`TestExecutionListenersNestedTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/junit/jupiter/nested/TestExecutionListenersNestedTests.java) test class that is only intended to be run as a top-level test class. Specifically, if you run a `@Test` in a `@Nested` test class directly, that test will fail, because the `@Test` methods in the enclosing test classes have not been run. Although that is perhaps questionable behavior, it is actually by design: this particular test fixture tests the interactions between JUnit Jupiter and the Spring TestContext Framework.\n\nWe also have [`SpringJUnitJupiterTestSuite`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-test/src/test/java/org/springframework/test/context/junit/SpringJUnitJupiterTestSuite.java), which selects `TestExecutionListenersNestedTests` via `@SelectPackages(\"org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter\")` and `@IncludeClassNamePatterns(\".*Tests$\")`.\n\nHistorically `SpringJUnitJupiterTestSuite` succeeded (with JUnit Jupiter versions prior to 5.13), but it now fails.\n\nSince that setup is a bit complex, I have reduced this scenario to just use the following JUnit Jupiter extensions.\n\n```java\nabstract class BaseExtension implements BeforeAllCallback {\n\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void beforeAll(ExtensionContext context) throws Exception {\n\t\tExecutionOrderForNestedTests.extensions.add(getClass().getSimpleName());\n\t}\n}\n\nclass Foo extends BaseExtension {\n}\n\nclass Bar extends BaseExtension {\n}\n\nclass Baz extends BaseExtension {\n}\n\nclass Qux extends BaseExtension {\n}\n```\n\nAnd the simplified test class looks like this.\n\n```java\npackage example;\n\n// imports...\n\n@ExtendWith(Foo.class)\nclass ExecutionOrderForNestedTests {\n\n\tstatic final String FOO = \"Foo\";\n\tstatic final String BAR = \"Bar\";\n\tstatic final String BAZ = \"Baz\";\n\tstatic final String QUX = \"Qux\";\n\n\tstatic final List<String> extensions = new ArrayList<>();\n\n\t@AfterEach\n\tvoid resetExtensions() {\n\t\textensions.clear();\n\t}\n\n\t@Test\n\tvoid test() {\n\t\tassertThat(extensions).containsExactly(FOO);\n\t}\n\n\t@Nested\n\tclass InheritedExtensionsTests {\n\n\t\t@Test\n\t\tvoid test() {\n\t\t\tassertThat(extensions).containsExactly(FOO);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t@Nested\n\t@ExtendWith(Bar.class)\n\tclass InheritedAndLocalExtensionsTests {\n\n\t\t@Test\n\t\tvoid test() {\n\t\t\tassertThat(extensions).containsExactly(FOO, BAR);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t@Nested\n\t\t@ExtendWith(Baz.class)\n\t\tclass DoubleNestedWithInheritedAndLocalExtensionsTests {\n\n\t\t\t@Test\n\t\t\tvoid test() {\n\t\t\t\tassertThat(extensions).containsExactly(FOO, BAR, BAZ);\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t@Nested\n\t\t\t@ExtendWith(Qux.class)\n\t\t\tclass TripleNestedWithInheritedAndLocalExtensionsTests {\n\n\t\t\t\t@Test\n\t\t\t\tvoid test() {\n\t\t\t\t\tassertThat(extensions).containsExactly(FOO, BAR, BAZ, QUX);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIf you run `ExecutionOrderForNestedTests` by itself, all of the tests (including the tests in the `@Nested` test classes) pass.\n\nAs I mentioned above, if you run an individual `@Test` in a `@Nested` test class directly, that will fail, but this is by design. So, that is not a regression.\n\n## The Regression\n\nThe regression is apparent only when running `ExecutionOrderForNestedTests` via a `@Suite`.\n\n✅ This suite passes:\n\n```java\n@Suite\n@SelectPackages(\"example\")\n@IncludeClassNamePatterns(\".+ExecutionOrderForNestedTests$\")\nclass TestSuite {\n}\n```\n\n✅ This suite also passes:\n\n```java\n@Suite\n@SelectClasses(ExecutionOrderForNestedTests.class)\nclass TestSuite {\n}\n```\n\n❌ This suite fails:\n\n```java\n@Suite\n@SelectPackages(\"example\")\nclass TestSuite {\n}\n```\n\n❌ This suite also fails:\n\n```java\n@Suite\n@SelectPackages(\"example\")\n@IncludeClassNamePatterns(\".+Tests$\")\nclass TestSuite {\n}\n```\n\nFor example, `TripleNestedWithInheritedAndLocalExtensionsTests.test()` fails as follows when run in one of those failing `@Suite` scenarios.\n\n```\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \nExpecting actual:\n  [\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\", \"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\", \"Qux\"]\nto contain exactly (and in same order):\n  [\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\", \"Qux\"]\nbut some elements were not expected:\n  [\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\"]\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nIf `ExecutionOrderForNestedTests` is _selected_ explicitly in the IDE or in a `@Suite` (without discovering the individual `@Nested` test classes in `ExecutionOrderForNestedTests`), all tests pass.\n\nIf the `@Nested` test classes in `ExecutionOrderForNestedTests` are discovered in a `@Suite` using classpath scanning via `@SelectPackages`, the `@Nested` test methods get executed **before** (or \"independently of\") the test methods in enclosing classes, which was not previously the case.\n","closed_by":{"login":"marcphilipp","id":214207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/214207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp","html_url":"https://github.com/marcphilipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcphilipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit-framework/issues/4600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
