+IntelliJ IDEA supports running tests on the JUnit Platform since version 2016.2.

+==== Other IDEs

+At the time of this writing, there is no direct support for running tests on the JUnit
+Platform within IDEs other than IntelliJ IDEA.
+However, the JUnit team provides two intermediate solutions so that
 you can go ahead and try out JUnit 5 within your IDE today. You can use the
 <<running-tests-console-launcher>> manually or execute tests with a
 <<running-tests-junit-platform-runner,JUnit 4 based Runner>>.
