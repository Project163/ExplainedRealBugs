 ==== Third-party Assertion Libraries
 
 Even though the assertion facilities provided by JUnit Jupiter are sufficient for many
-testing scenarios, there are times when more power and additional functionality such as
-_matchers_ are desired or required. In such cases, the JUnit team recommends the use of
-third-party assertion libraries such as {AssertJ}, {Hamcrest}, {Truth}, etc. Developers
-are therefore free to use the assertion library of their choice.

-For example, the combination of _matchers_ and a fluent API can be used to make
-assertions more descriptive and readable. However, JUnit Jupiter's `{Assertions}` class

-https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/hamcrest/Matcher.html[`Matcher`]. Instead,
-developers are encouraged to use the built-in support for matchers provided by third-party
-assertion libraries.

-The following example demonstrates how to use the `assertThat()` support from Hamcrest in
-a JUnit Jupiter test. As long as the Hamcrest library has been added to the classpath,
-you can statically import methods such as `assertThat()`, `is()`, and `equalTo()` and
-then use them in tests like in the `assertWithHamcrestMatcher()` method below.
