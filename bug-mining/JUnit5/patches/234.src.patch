 By default, JUnit Jupiter tests are run sequentially in a single thread. Running tests in
 parallel -- for example, to speed up execution -- is available as an opt-in feature since

+Enabling this property is but the first step to execute tests in parallel. If enabled,
+test classes and methods are still executed sequentially by default. Whether or not a node
+in the test tree is executed concurrently is controlled by its execution mode. The
+following two modes are available:
+
+`SAME_THREAD`::
+  Force execution in the same thread used by the parent. For example, when used on a test
+  method, the test method will be executed in the same thread as any `@BeforeAll` or
+  `@AfterAll` methods of the containing test class.
+
+`CONCURRENT`::
+  Execute concurrently unless a resource lock forces execution in the same thread.
+
+By default, nodes in the test tree use the `SAME_THREAD` execution mode. You can change
+the default by setting the `junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default` configuration
+parameter. Alternatively, you can use the `{Execution}` annotation to change the execution
+mode for the annotated element and its subelements (if any) which allows to activate
+parallel execution for individual test classes, one by one.

+junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
+junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = concurrent

+
+The default execution mode is applied to all nodes of the test tree with a few notable
+exceptions, namely test classes that use the `Lifecycle.PER_CLASS` mode or a
+`{MethodOrderer}` (expect for `{Random}`). In the former case, test authors have to ensure
+that the test class is thread-safe; in the latter, concurrent execution might conflict
+with the configured execution order. Thus, in both cases, test methods in such test
+classes are only executed concurrently if the `@Execution(CONCURRENT)` annotation is
+present on the test class or method.

 ==== Synchronization
 
-In the `org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel` package, JUnit Jupiter provides two
-annotation-based declarative mechanisms to change the execution mode and allow for
-synchronization when using shared resources in different tests.

-If parallel execution is enabled, all classes and methods are executed concurrently by
-default. You can change the execution mode for the annotated element and its subelements
-(if any) by using the `{Execution}` annotation. The following two modes are available:
-
-`SAME_THREAD`::

-  `@AfterAll` methods of the containing test class.

-`CONCURRENT`::
-  Execute concurrently unless a resource lock forces execution in the same thread.

-In addition, the `{ResourceLock}` annotation allows you to declare that a test class or
-method uses a specific shared resource that requires synchronized access to ensure
-reliable test execution. The shared resource is identified by a unique name which is a
-`String`. The name can be user-defined or one of the predefined constants in
-`{Resources}`: `SYSTEM_PROPERTIES`, `SYSTEM_OUT`, or `SYSTEM_ERR`.
