+==== Parallelization at Class Level
+
+Let's assume we have two test classes `FooTest` and `BarTest` with each class containing
+three unit tests. Now, let's enable parallel execution of test classes:
+
+[source,properties]
+----
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.enabled=true
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.classes=true
+----
+
+With this setup, the `VintageTestEngine` will use two different threads,
+one for each test class:
+
+[source,plaintext]
+----
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 - BarTest::test1
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 - FooTest::test1
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 - BarTest::test2

+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 - BarTest::test3
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 - FooTest::test3
+----
+
+[[migrating-from-junit4-parallel-execution-method-level]]
+==== Parallelization at Method Level
+
+Alternatively, we can enable parallel test execution at a method level,
+rather than the class level:
+
+[source,properties]
+----
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.enabled=true
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.methods=true
+----
+
+Therefore, the test methods within each class will be executed in parallel, while
+different test classes will be executed sequentially:
+
+[source,plaintext]

+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 - BarTest::test1
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 - BarTest::test2
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3 - BarTest::test3

+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3 - FooTest::test1
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 - FooTest::test2
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1 - FooTest::test3
+----
+
+[[migrating-from-junit4-parallel-execution-class-and-method-level]]
+==== Full Parallelization
+
+Finally, we can also enable parallelization at both class and method level:
+
+[source,properties]
+----
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.enabled=true
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.classes=true
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.methods=true
+----
+
+With these properties set, the `VintageTestEngine` will execute all tests classes and
+methods in parallel, potentially significantly reducing the overall test suite execution time:
+
+[source,plaintext]

+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-6 - FooTest::test2
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-7 - BarTest::test3
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3 - FooTest::test1

+can also configure the pool size explicitly:

-With these properties set, the `VintageTestEngine` will execute tests in parallel,
-potentially significantly reducing the overall test suite execution time.
+For instance, if we update our previous example that uses full parallelization and
+configure the pool size to four, we can expect to see our six test methods executed with
+a parallelism of four:

+[source,plaintext]
+----
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 - FooTest::test1
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-4 - BarTest::test2

+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-4 - BarTest::test3
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2 - FooTest::test2
+ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3 - FooTest::test3
+----
+
+As we can see, even though we set the thread pool size was four, only three threads were
+used in this case. This happens because the pool adjusts the number of active threads
+based on workload and system needs.
+
+[[migrating-from-junit4-parallel-execution-disabled]]
+==== Sequential Execution
+
+On the other hand, if we disable parallel execution, the `VintageTestEngine`
+will execute all tests sequentially, regardless of the other properties:
+
+[source,properties]
+----
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.enabled=false
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.classes=true
+junit.vintage.execution.parallel.methods=true
+----
+
+Similarly, tests will be executed sequentially if you enable parallel execution in general
+but enable neither class-level nor method-level parallelization.
