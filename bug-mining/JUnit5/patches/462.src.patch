-=== JUnit Platform
-
-==== Bug Fixes
-
-* `SummaryGeneratingListener` is now thread-safe and can handle concurrently failing tests.
-
-==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes
-
-* For consistency with the rest of the JUnit Platform, the experimental
-  `LauncherDiscoveryListener` is now an interface instead of an abstract class.
-
-==== New Features and Improvements
-
-* New `test(Condition<Event>)` and `nestedContainer(Class<?>, Condition<Event>)` methods
-  in `EventConditions` that allow you to provide conditions for matching against test and
-  nested container events when using the `EngineTestKit`. For example,
-  `test(displayName("my test"))` can be used to match against a test whose display name is
-  `my test`.
-* The `junit-platform-jfr` module now reports execution events for containers -- for
-  example, test classes.
-* The `junit-platform-jfr` module now reports test discovery events for the launcher and
-  registered test engines.
-* Custom `LauncherDiscoveryListener` implementations can now be registered via Java’s
-  `{ServiceLoader}` mechanism.
-* Documented constant value of `ExclusiveResource.GLOBAL_KEY`.
-* Instances of `TestIdentifier` and `UniqueId` now retain less memory because they no
-  longer store `String` representations of unique IDs.
-* Tools that make multiple calls to the `Launcher` API should now create a
-  `LauncherSession` in order to allow for executing global setup and teardown code exactly
-  once via the new `LauncherSessionListener` interface that can be registered via Java’s
-  `{ServiceLoader}` mechanism.
-* New `junit-platform-suite-engine` to execute declarative test suites using the JUnit
-  Platform Launcher.
-* Additional selectors in the suite API in the `junit-platform-suite-api` module.
-
-
-[[release-notes-5.8.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
-=== JUnit Jupiter
-
-==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes
-
-* `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation<Void>, ExtensionContext)` has
-  been deprecated in favor of
-  `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation<Void>, DynamicTestInvocationContext, ExtensionContext)`
-  that provides access to the dynamic test executable via
-  `DynamicTestInvocationContext.getExecutable()`.
-
-==== New Features and Improvements
-
-* Top-level test classes can now be ordered by passing the fully-qualified name of a class
-  implementing `ClassOrderer` as the value of the new
-  `junit.jupiter.testclass.order.default` configuration parameter.
-* New `assertInstanceOf()` methods which produce better error messages comparable to those
-  produced by `assertThrows`. These new methods serve as a replacement for
-  `assertTrue(obj instanceof X)`.
-* `assertNull()` failure messages now include the actual object's type if the `toString()`
-  implementation for the actual object returns `null` or `"null"`. This avoids the
-  generation of confusing failure messages such as `expected <null> but was <null>`.
-* Numeric literals used with `@CsvSource` or `CsvFileSource` can now be expressed using
-  underscores as in some JVM languages, to improve readability of long numbers like
-  `700_000_000`.
-* CSV rows provided via `@CsvSource` may now start with a number sign (`#`).
-* New `ignoreLeadingAndTrailingWhitespace` attributes in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`
-  (set to `true` by default) to control whether or not to trim whitespace.
-* Dynamic tests now require less memory thanks to a number of improvements to internal
-  data structures.
-* Documented constant values in `org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.Resources`.
-* In parameterized tests with `@MethodSource` or `@ArgumentSource`, arguments can now have
-  optional names (supplied via the new `Named` API). When the argument is included in the
-  display name of an iteration, this name will be used instead of the value.
-* `DynamicTests.stream()` can now consume `Named` input and will use each name-value pair
-  as the display name and value for each generated dynamic test (see
-  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-dynamic-tests-examples,User Guide>> for details).

-==== Bug Fixes
-
-* Classes explicitly selected via `@SelectClasses` are now always included in the test
-  suite. This applies to `@Suite` classes running via the `SuiteTestEngine` and suite
-  classes running via the `JUnitPlatform` `Runner`.
-
-==== New Features and Improvements
-
-* New `findAnnotation(Class,Class,SearchOption)` method in `AnnotationSupport` that
-  performs the same search algorithm as `findAnnotation(AnnotatedElement,Class)` but also
-  searches the enclosing class hierarchy for inner classes if the
-  `INCLUDE_ENCLOSING_CLASSES` `SearchOption` is specified. This new method can be used by
-  extension authors to find annotations on enclosing classes for JUnit Jupiter `@Nested`
-  test classes.
-* New `ClassSource.from(URI)` static factory method for creating a `ClassSource` from a
-  URI using the `class` scheme and optional query parameters specifying the line number
-  and column number. This is analogous to the existing `ClasspathResourceSource.from(URI)`
-  factory method.
-* New `getConfigurationParameters()` method in the `TestPlan` which allows a
-  `TestExecutionListener` to access
-  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-config-params, configuration parameters>>. See
-  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-listeners-config, Configuring an Execution
-  Listener>> for details.
-* New `UniqueIdTrackingListener` which is a `TestExecutionListener` that tracks the unique
-  IDs of all tests that were skipped or executed during the `TestPlan` and generates a
-  file containing the unique IDs. The generated file can be used to rerun those tests --
-  for example, in order to run the same set of tests executed on the JVM subsequently
-  within a GraalVM native image. See the Javadoc for `{UniqueIdTrackingListener}` for
-  details.
-* Generating Java Flight Recorder events via module `org.junit.platform.jfr` is now also
-  supported on Java 8 Update 262 or higher, in addition to Java 11 or later. See
-  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests, Flight Recorder Support>> for details.
-* Suites executed by the `junit-platform-suite` module will now inherit the configuration
-  parameters from the parent discovery request. This behavior can be disabled via the
-  `@DisableParentConfigurationParameters` annotation.
-
-
-[[release-notes-5.8.0-RC1-junit-jupiter]]
-=== JUnit Jupiter
-
-==== Bug Fixes
-
-* `@DisplayNameGeneration` and `@IndicativeSentencesGeneration` are now only inherited
-  from enclosing classes if the current class is a `@Nested` test class.
-* The `IndicativeSentences` `DisplayNameGenerator` no longer includes the display name of
-  the enclosing class when generating an _indicative sentence_ if the enclosing class is
-  not configured to use the `IndicativeSentences` display name generator as well.
-* The `TypedArgumentConverter` base class now supports the conversion of a `null` source
-  value in parameterized tests.
-* The `TypedArgumentConverter` base class now supports conversion to a primitive type if
-  the configured target type is a wrapper for the target primitive type, including
-  primitive widening support -- for example, from `Integer` to `int` or `long`.
-* Exceptions thrown from instances of `CloseableResource` no longer hide test failures but
-  are instead reported as suppressed exceptions.
-
-==== New Features and Improvements
-
-* New `assertThrowsExactly()` method in `Assertions` which is a more strict version of
-  `assertThrows()` that allows you to assert that the exception thrown is of the exact
-  type specified.
-* `assertDoesNotThrow()` in `Assertions` now supports suspending functions when called
-  from Kotlin.
-* `@TempDir` can now be used to create multiple temporary directories. Instead of creating
-  a single temporary directory per context (i.e. test class or method) every declaration
-  of the `@TempDir` annotation on a field or method parameter now results in a separate
-  temporary directory. To revert to the old behavior of using a single temporary directory
-  for the entire test class or method (depending on which level the annotation is used),
-  you can set the `junit.jupiter.tempdir.scope` configuration parameter to `per_context`.
-* `@TempDir` cleanup resets readable and executable permissions of the root temporary
-  directory and any contained directories instead of failing to delete them.
-* `@TempDir` fields may now be `private`.
-* `@ExtendWith` may now be used to register extensions declaratively via fields or
-  parameters in test class constructors, test methods, and lifecycle methods. See
-  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-registration-declarative, Declarative Extension
-  Registration>> for details.
-* New `named()` static factory method in the `Named` interface that serves as an _alias_
-  for `Named.of()`. `named()` is intended to be used via `import static`.
-* New `class` URI scheme for dynamic test sources. This allows tests to be located using
-  the information available in a `StackTraceElement`.
-* New `autoCloseArguments` attribute in `@ParameterizedTest` to close `AutoCloseable`
-  arguments at the end of the test. This attribute defaults to true.
