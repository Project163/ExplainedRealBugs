+Since the `junit-platform-console-standalone` JAR contains the contents of all of its
+dependencies, its Maven POM does not declare any dependencies.
+
+Furthermore, it is not very likely that you would need to include a dependency on the
+`junit-platform-console-standalone` artifact in your project's Maven POM or Gradle build
+script. On the contrary, the executable `junit-platform-console-standalone` JAR is
+typically invoked directly from the command line or a shell script without a build script.

+If you need to declare dependencies in your build script on some of the artifacts
+contained in the `junit-platform-console-standalone` artifact, you should declare
+dependencies only on the JUnit artifacts that are used in your project. To simplify
+dependency management of JUnit artifacts in your build, you may wish to use the
+`junit-jupiter` aggregator artifact or `junit-bom`. See <<dependency-metadata>> for
