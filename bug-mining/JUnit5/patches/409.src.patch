+
+In this example preconditions from outer tests are used in inner tests by defining
+hierarchical lifecycle methods for the setup code. E.g., the method `createNewStack()`
+annotated as a lifecycle method with `@BeforeEach` is such a setup method which is used
+at all level below in the nesting tree.
+
+The fact that setup code from outer tests is run before inner tests are executed gives
+you the ability to run all tests independently. You can even run inner tests alone
+without outer tests, because the setup code from the outer tests is always executed.

 NOTE: _Only non-static nested classes_ (i.e. _inner classes_) can serve as `@Nested` test
-classes. Nesting can be arbitrarily deep, and those inner classes are considered to be
-full members of the test class family with one exception: `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll`
-methods do not work _by default_. The reason is that Java does not allow `static` members
-in inner classes. However, this restriction can be circumvented by annotating a `@Nested`
-test class with `@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)` (see
