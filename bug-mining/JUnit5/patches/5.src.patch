+## Coding Conventions
+
+### Formatting
+
+Code formatting is enforced using the [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) Gradle plugin. You can use `gradle spotlessApply` to format new code and add missing license headers to source files. Formatter settings for Eclipse are available [in the repository](src/eclipse/junit-lambda-eclipse-formatter-settings.xml). For IntelliJ IDEA there's a [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546) you can use.
+
+### Tests
+
+#### Naming
+
+- All test classes must end with a `Tests` suffix.
+- Example test classes that should not be picked up by the build must end with a `TestCase` suffix.
+
+#### Assertions
+
+- Use `org.junit.gen5.api.Assertions` wherever possible.
+- Use AssertJ when richer assertions are needed.
+- Do not use `org.junit.Assert` or `junit.framework.Assert`.
+
+#### Mocking
+
+- Use either Mockito or hand-written test doubles.
