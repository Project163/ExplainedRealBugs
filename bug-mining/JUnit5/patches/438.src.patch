+=== Using Listeners
+
+The JUnit Platform provides the following listener APIs that allow JUnit, third parties,
+and custom user code to react to events fired at various points during the discovery and
+execution of a `TestPlan`.
+
+* `{LauncherSessionListener}`: receives events when a `{LauncherSession}` is opened and
+  closed.
+* `{LauncherDiscoveryListener}`: receives events that occur during test discovery.
+* `{TestExecutionListener}`: receives events that occur during test execution.
+
+The `LauncherSessionListener` API is typically implemented by build tools or IDEs and
+registered automatically for you in order to support some feature of the build tool or IDE.
+
+The `LauncherDiscoveryListener` and `TestExecutionListener` APIs are often implemented in
+order to produce some form of report or to display a graphical representation of the test
+plan in an IDE. Such listeners may be implemented and automatically registered by a build
+tool or IDE, or they may be included in a third-party library – potentially registered
+for you automatically. You can also implement and register your own listeners.
+
+For details on registering and configuring listeners, see the following sections of this
+guide.

+
+The JUnit Platform provides the following listeners which you may wish to use with your
+test suite.
+
+<<running-tests-listeners-flight-recorder>> ::
+  `FlightRecordingExecutionListener` and `FlightRecordingDiscoveryListener` that generate
+  Java Flight Recorder events during test discovery and execution.
+
+`{LegacyXmlReportGeneratingListener}` ::
+  `TestExecutionListener` that generates XML reports compatible with the de facto
+  standard for JUnit 4 based test reports. See <<junit-platform-reporting>> for
+  details.
+
+`{LoggingListener}` ::
+  `TestExecutionListener` for logging informational messages for all events via a
+  `BiConsumer` that consumes `Throwable` and `Supplier<String>`.
+
+`{SummaryGeneratingListener}` ::
+  `TestExecutionListener` that generates a summary of the test execution which can be
+  printed via a `PrintWriter`.
+
+`{UniqueIdTrackingListener}` ::
+  `TestExecutionListener` that that tracks the unique IDs of all tests that were
+  executed during the execution of the `TestPlan` and generates a file containing the
+  unique IDs once execution of the `TestPlan` has finished.
