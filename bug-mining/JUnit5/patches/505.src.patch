+==== Spring Boot
+
+link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] provides automatic support for
+managing the version of JUnit used in your project. In addition, the
+`spring-boot-starter-test` artifact automatically includes testing libraries such as JUnit
+Jupiter, AspectJ, Mockito, etc.
+
+If your build relies on dependency management support from Spring Boot, you should not
+import the <<dependency-metadata-junit-bom,`junit-bom`>> in your build script since that
+will result in duplicate (and potentially conflicting) management of JUnit dependencies.
+
+If you need to override the version of a dependency used in your Spring Boot application,
+you have to override the exact name of the
+link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#appendix.dependency-versions.properties[version property]
+defined in the BOM used by the Spring Boot plugin. For example, the name of the JUnit
+Jupiter version property in Spring Boot is `junit-jupiter.version`. The mechanism for
+changing a dependency version is documented for both
+link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#managing-dependencies.dependency-management-plugin.customizing[Gradle]
+and
+link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#using.parent-pom[Maven].
+
+With Gradle you can override the JUnit Jupiter version by including the following in your
+`build.gradle` file.
