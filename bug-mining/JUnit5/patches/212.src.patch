 In contrast to `@Test` methods, a `@TestFactory` method is not itself a test case but
 rather a factory for test cases. Thus, a dynamic test is the product of a factory.
-Technically speaking, a `@TestFactory` method must return a `Stream`, `Collection`,
-`Iterable`, `Iterator`, or array of `DynamicNode` instances. Instantiable subclasses of
-`DynamicNode` are `DynamicContainer` and `DynamicTest`. `DynamicContainer` instances are
-composed of a _display name_ and a list of dynamic child nodes, enabling the creation of
-arbitrarily nested hierarchies of dynamic nodes. `DynamicTest` instances will be
-executed lazily, enabling dynamic and even non-deterministic generation of test cases.

 Any `Stream` returned by a `@TestFactory` will be properly closed by calling
 `stream.close()`, making it safe to use a resource such as `Files.lines()`.
