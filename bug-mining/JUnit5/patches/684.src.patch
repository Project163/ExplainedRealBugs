 for executing tests on the JUnit Platform. The `pom.xml` file in the

 and can serve as a starting point for configuring your Maven build.

-https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-1585[introduced support] for aligning the

-the test runtime classpath. Therefore, it is recommended to use version 3.0.0-M4 or later
-to avoid interoperability issues.

+To avoid interoperability issues, it is recommended to use a recent version of Maven
+Surefire/Failsafe (3.0.0 or later) because it automatically aligns the version of the
+JUnit Platform Launcher that is used with the JUnit Platform version found on the test
+runtime classpath.
+
+If you are using a version older than 3.0.0-M4, you can work around the missing alignment
+by adding a test dependency on the matching version of the JUnit Platform Launcher to your
+Maven build as follows.
