-=== Overall Improvements
-
-* In 5.0.1, all artifacts were changed to have an _optional_ instead of a mandatory
-  dependency on the _@API Guardian_ JAR in their published Maven POMs. However, although
-  the Java compiler should ignore missing annotation types, a lot of users have reported
-  that compiling tests without having the _@API Guardian_ JAR on the classpath results in
-  warnings emitted by `javac` that look like this:
-+
-----
-warning: unknown enum constant Status.STABLE
-reason: class file for org.apiguardian.api.API$Status not found
-----
-+
-To avoid confusion, the JUnit team has decided to make the dependency to the
-_@API Guardian_ JAR _mandatory_ again.
-
-
-[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-junit-platform]]
-=== JUnit Platform
-
-==== Bug Fixes
-
-* Test methods selected by _fully qualified method name_ via
-  `DiscoverySelectors.selectMethod(String)`, via the `method` or `methods` element of the
-  `selectors` configuration for the `junitPlatform` Gradle plugin, or via the
-  `-select-method` or `-m` command-line options for the `ConsoleLauncher` can now contain
-  special characters -- for example, for JVM languages such as Kotlin and Groovy.
-* Summary table is no longer printed via the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin when
-  details mode `NONE` is selected, unless there are errors.
-* The current module layer is now used when scanning for test classes within modules. The
-  current module layer is the one that the class loader for the `ModuleUtils` class
-  returns. If the current layer cannot be obtained, the algorithm falls back to the boot
-  layer.
-* The XML report produced by the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin is no longer invalid
-  when the exception message of a failed test contains the XML CDATA end marker `]]>`.
-* The `ConsoleLauncher`, the Gradle plugin, and the Maven Surefire provider now attempt to
-  write a valid class name into the `classname` attribute of `<testcase/>` elements in the
-  XML reports. In addition, the `name` attribute of dynamic tests and test template
-  invocations (such as repeated and parameterized tests) is now suffixed with the index of
-  the invocation so they are distinguishable by reporting tools.
-* The Maven Surefire provider now includes the method parameter types when writing the
-  `name` attribute of `<testcase/>` elements into XML reports. However, due to a
-  limitation of Maven Surefire, instead of `methodName(Type)` they are written as
-  `methodName{Type}`.
-
-==== New Features and Improvements
-
-* New `SUMMARY` details mode for the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin which prints
-  the table of success and failure counts at the end of test plan execution. This new
-  mode is analogous to the previous behavior of the `NONE` details mode.
-* The summary table of a console launcher run now contains the initial ten stack trace
-  lines to better describe the location of the failure.
-* Non-inherited _composed annotations_ which are meta-annotated with a given `@Inherited`
-  annotation are now considered to be implicitly _inherited_ when searching for the given
-  meta-annotation within a class hierarchy.
-* The Maven Surefire provider now supports the `test` parameter that tells Surefire to
-  only execute a subset of test classes or methods, e.g. by specifying `-Dtest=...` on the
-  command line (see the
-  http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#test[Surefire documentation]
-  for details).
-* Tests can now be included or excluded based on their tags using a
-  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-tag-expressions, tag expression language>> when
-  executed using the `Launcher`, `ConsoleLauncher`, Gradle plugin, or Maven Surefire
-  provider.
-
-
-[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-junit-jupiter]]
-=== JUnit Jupiter
-
-==== Bug Fixes
-
-* Test classes selected via one of the `selectClass()` variants in `DiscoverySelectors`,
-  via the `aClass` or `classes` element of the `selectors` configuration for the
-  `junitPlatform` Gradle plugin, or via the `-select-class` or `-c` command-line options
-  for the `ConsoleLauncher` are no longer allowed to be `private`. This aligns with the
-  behavior for test classes discovered via package, class path, and module path scanning.
-
-==== New Features and Improvements
-
-* Developers can now register extensions _programmatically_ by annotating fields in test
-  classes with `{RegisterExtension}`.
-** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-registration-programmatic, Programmatic
-   Extension Registration>> in the User Guide for details.
-* New `@EnabledIf` annotation that is used to control whether the annotated test class or
-  test method is _enabled_ or _disabled_ by evaluating a script from a dynamic scripting
-  language such as JavaScript or Groovy.
-** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-conditional, Conditional Test Execution>>
-   in the User Guide for details.
-* `@ValueSource` now additionally supports literal values of type `short`, `byte`,
-  `float`, `char`, and `java.lang.Class` for parameterized tests.
-* New support for parameterized tests for implicit conversion from a `String` to an
-  argument of any of the following common Java types. See the
-  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit-table,
-  implicit conversion table>> in the User Guide for examples.
-** `java.io.File`
-** `java.math.BigDecimal`
-** `java.math.BigInteger`
-** `java.net.URI`
-** `java.net.URL`
-** `java.nio.charset.Charset`
-** `java.nio.file.Path`
-** `java.util.Currency`
-** `java.util.Locale`
-** `java.util.UUID`
-* New fallback mechanism for parameterized tests for implicit conversion from a `String`
-  to an argument of a given target type if the target type declares exactly one suitable
-  _factory method_ or a _factory constructor_.
-** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit-fallback,
-   Fallback String-to-Object Conversion>> in the User Guide for details.
-* Due to a change in the JUnit Platform's `AnnotationUtils` class, non-inherited
-  _composed annotations_ which are meta-annotated with a given `@Inherited` annotation
-  are now considered to be implicitly _inherited_ when searching for the given
-  meta-annotation within a class hierarchy.
-** For example, an `@Inherited` annotation such as `@TestInstance` will now be discovered
-   on a custom _composed annotation_ declared on a superclass even if the _composed
-   annotation_ is not declared as `@Inherited`.
-* Extensions for JUnit Jupiter can now access JUnit Platform configuration parameters at
-  runtime via the new `getConfigurationParameter(String key)` method in the
-  `ExtensionContext` API.
-* Extensions for JUnit Jupiter can now access the `Lifecycle` of the current test
-  instance via the new `getTestInstanceLifecycle()` method in the `ExtensionContext` API.
-* New callback interface `CloseableResource` introduced in `ExtensionContext.Store`. A
-  `Store` is bound to the lifecycle of its extension context. When the lifecycle of an
-  extension context ends, the associated store is closed, and each stored value that is
-  an instance of `ExtensionContext.Store.CloseableResource` is notified by an invocation
-  of its `close()` method.
-* Selected dynamic tests and test template invocations can now be executed separately
-  without running the complete test factory or test template. This allows to rerun single
-  or selected parameterized, repeated or dynamic tests by selecting their unique IDs in
-  subsequent discovery requests.
-* New Kotlin-friendly `fail` methods added as _top-level functions_ in the
-  `org.junit.jupiter.api` package.
-** When calling the `Assertions.fail` methods from Kotlin, the compiler required the
-   generic return type of `fail` to be declared explicitly when calling it -- for
-   example, `fail<Nothing>("Some message")`. These new top-level functions remove this
-   requirement by returning
-   https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-nothing.html[`Nothing`].

-[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-junit-vintage]]
-=== JUnit Vintage
-
-==== Bug Fixes
-
-* When using a tag filter to include/exclude a tag that represents a JUnit 4 category,
-  e.g. `"com.example.Integration"`, the Vintage Engine no longer mistakenly executes all
-  test methods of test classes that contain at least one included test method, e.g. one
-  that is annotated with `@Category(com.example.Integration.class)`, regardless whether
-  they belong to the same category.

-
-
-[[release-notes-5.1.0-RC1-junit-vintage]]
-=== JUnit Vintage
-
-==== New Features and Improvements
-
-* Prior to this release, the Vintage test engine only returned a childless
-  `TestDescriptor` for test classes annotated with `@Ignore`. However, build tools like
-  Gradle need to show an accurate number of tests, i.e. they want to access and count the
-  test methods of a test class regardless whether it's ignored.
-  The Jupiter engine already discovers skipped containers, e.g. test classes annotated
-  with `@Disabled`, including their children and descendants. The Vintage engine now
-  adopts this approach and returns a full subtree of `TestDescriptors` for classes
-  annotated with `@Ignore`. During execution, it will only report the `TestDescriptor`
-  of the test class as skipped which is consistent with how the Jupiter engine reports
-  skipped containers.

+* The `value` attribute of `@MethodSource` is no longer mandatory. If no value (or an
+  empty String) is supplied as a method name, a method with the same name as the current
+  `@ParameterizedTest` method will be used as the factory method by convention.
+** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-MethodSource,
+   @MethodSource>> in the User Guide for details.
+* New support for parameterized tests for implicit conversion from a `String` to an
+  argument of any of the following common Java types. See the
+  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit-table,
+  implicit conversion table>> in the User Guide for examples.
+** `java.io.File`
+** `java.math.BigDecimal`
+** `java.math.BigInteger`
+** `java.net.URI`
+** `java.net.URL`
+** `java.nio.charset.Charset`
+** `java.nio.file.Path`
+** `java.util.Currency`
+** `java.util.Locale`
+** `java.util.UUID`
+* New fallback mechanism for parameterized tests for implicit conversion from a `String`
+  to an argument of a given target type if the target type declares exactly one suitable
+  _factory method_ or a _factory constructor_.
+** See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-conversion-implicit-fallback,
+   Fallback String-to-Object Conversion>> in the User Guide for details.

+===== Extension Model
+
+* Extensions for JUnit Jupiter can now access JUnit Platform configuration parameters at
+  runtime via the new `getConfigurationParameter(String key)` method in the
+  `ExtensionContext` API.
+* Extensions for JUnit Jupiter can now access the `Lifecycle` of the current test
+  instance via the new `getTestInstanceLifecycle()` method in the `ExtensionContext` API.
+* New callback interface `CloseableResource` introduced in `ExtensionContext.Store`. A
+  `Store` is bound to the lifecycle of its extension context. When the lifecycle of an
+  extension context ends, the associated store is closed, and each stored value that is
+  an instance of `ExtensionContext.Store.CloseableResource` is notified by an invocation
+  of its `close()` method.
+* New `getOrComputeIfAbsent(Class)` convenience method in `ExtensionContext.Store` that
+  simplifies use cases where an extension wishes to store a single object of a given type
+  (keyed by that type) in the `Store` and the object is created using the default
+  constructor for that type.
+  - For example, code such as
+    `store.getOrComputeIfAbsent(X.class, key \-> new X(), X.class)` can now replaced with
+    `store.getOrComputeIfAbsent(X.class)`.

 ==== Bug Fixes
 
-* Due to a regression introduced in 5.1.0-RC1, test classes were reported as started
-  to `TestExecutionListeners` after their `@BeforeClass` methods were executed.
-  Now, they are reported as early as possible again, in particular before invoking
-  `@BeforeClass` methods.
-
-==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes
-
-* ❓
+* When using a tag filter to include/exclude a tag that represents a JUnit 4 category,
+  e.g. `"com.example.Integration"`, the Vintage Engine no longer mistakenly executes all
+  test methods of test classes that contain at least one included test method, e.g. one
+  that is annotated with `@Category(com.example.Integration.class)`, regardless whether
+  they belong to the same category.
 
 ==== New Features and Improvements
 
-* ❓
+* The `VintageTestEngine` supports the new JUnit Platform `ModuleSelector` for selecting
+  Java 9 modules.
+  - This is an alternative to the existing classpath scanning support.
+* Prior to this release, the Vintage test engine only returned a childless
+  `TestDescriptor` for test classes annotated with `@Ignore`. However, build tools like
+  Gradle need to show an accurate number of tests, i.e. they want to access and count the
+  test methods of a test class regardless whether it's ignored.
+  The Jupiter engine already discovers skipped containers, e.g. test classes annotated
+  with `@Disabled`, including their children and descendants. The Vintage engine now
+  adopts this approach and returns a full subtree of `TestDescriptors` for classes
+  annotated with `@Ignore`. During execution, it will only report the `TestDescriptor`
+  of the test class as skipped which is consistent with how the Jupiter engine reports
+  skipped containers.
