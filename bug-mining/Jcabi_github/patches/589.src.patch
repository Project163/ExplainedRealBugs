+                             the parent pom. However, com.jcabi:1.6.1, which is
+                             the current parent, references a buggy version of
+                             the plugin which cannot build on Windows. When a
+                             new version of com.jcabi is released referencing
+                             a fixed Qulice version, let's remove the version
+                             element here and revert it back to being managed by
+                             the parent.
