+ * <p>There are some design conventions in this library, which is important
+ * to keep in mind.
+ *
+ * <p>Sometimes we use {@link JsonObject} as an input argument for a method
+ * (for example, in {@link Repos#create(JsonObject)}),
+ * somewhere else we use {@link Map}
+ * (see {@link Issues#iterate(Map)}),
+ * in other case we use just a few plain Java types
+ * (see {@link DeployKeys#create(String,String)}),
+ * and sometimes we combine them
+ * (see {@link Hooks#create(String,Map)}).
+ * This is not a bug, it's done intentionally.
+ * The logic is simple.
+ * Class {@link JsonObject} is used when Github API is
+ * expecting a JSON object as HTTP request body.
+ * {@link Map} is used when Github API expects HTTP query parameters,
+ * and some of them are optional, and there are more than two of them.
+ * In all other situations we're using plain Java types.
