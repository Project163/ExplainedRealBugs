 There are many integration tests that check our classes against
 live Github accounts. In order to run them, you should create
-a new Github OAuth access token
+a new Github OAuth access tokens
 ([how?](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use)),
-and provide it in command line, like this:
+and provide them in command line, like this:
 
 ```
-$ mvn clean install -Dit.test=RtGistITCase -Dfailsafe.github.key=<token> -Dfailsafe.github.repo=<repo>
+$ mvn clean install -Dit.test=RtGistITCase -Dfailsafe.github.key=<token> -Dfailsafe.github.key.second=<second-token> -Dfailsafe.github.repo=<repo>
 ```
 
-Replace `<token>` with the OAuth access token, and `<repo>` with the name of
-repository you create in your account (for test purposes only), for example `yegor256/test`.
-The `failsafe.github.key` should have permissions in `failsafe.github.repo` to all scopes needed
-by the integration test suite you want to run (including `delete_repo`, which is not set by default!).
+Replace `<token>` and `<second-token>` with the OAuth access tokens of two different Github
+accounts. This test case will try to fork a gist from first account into second. Replace
+`<repo>` with the name of repository you create in your first account (for test purposes
+only), for example `yegor256/test`. OAuth access tokens should have permissions in their
+respective repos to all scopes needed by the integration test suite you want to run
+(including `delete_repo`, which is not set by default!).
+Incorrect documentation - example integration test run script #976
 Please note that different integration tests may need keys with permissions to different
 [scopes](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes);
 the `RtGistITCase` test requires permissions to gist scope.
