We need to implement the following: 1) Add the operations in http://developer.github.com/v3/git/tags/ to the Tags interface. 2) A class RtTags, which performs RESTful request operations against the Tags API. 3) A class MkTags, which mocks the Tags interface. 4) An interface Tag, which represents a single Tag of the Git Data API. 5) RtTags, a Tag implementation which fetches and modifies Tag information according to the Tags API, and 6) MkTag, which mocks a single Reference object. Don't forget to implement unit tests and integration tests.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmarkov","id":5993843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTM4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5993843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov","html_url":"https://github.com/dmarkov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
