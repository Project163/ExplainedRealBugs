It probably occurs because of a concurrent build, or a previous build that failed to execute cleanly.\n\nI think the best way to deal with this is to use a randomized name for the tags in both the `setUp()` method and the actual test. A hard-coded name may already exist on the test repo that we're targetting.\n\n```\nResults :\n\nFailed tests:\n  RtReleaseITCase.canEditRelease:97 HTTP response status is not equal to 200:\n422 Unprocessable Entity [https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi-github-test/test/releases/216164]\nServer: GitHub.com\nDate: Sun, 09 Mar 2014 18:15:54 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nStatus: 422 Unprocessable Entity\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 5000\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 4992\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1394392554\nX-OAuth-Scopes: admin:org, admin:public_key, admin:repo_hook, delete_repo, gist, notifications, repo, user\nX-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes:\nX-GitHub-Media-Type: github.beta\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nContent-Length: 192\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-GitHub-OTP, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nX-GitHub-Request-Id: 36516151:3CF7:550E408:531CAFDA\n\n{\"message\":\"Validation Failed\",\"documentation_url\":\"http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#edit-a-release\",\"errors\":[{\"resource\":\"Release\",\"code\":\"already_exists\",\"field\":\"tag_name\"}]}\nExpected: HTTP response with status 200\n     but: was <422 Unprocessable Entity [https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi-github-test/test/releases/216164]\nServer: GitHub.com\nDate: Sun, 09 Mar 2014 18:15:54 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nStatus: 422 Unprocessable Entity\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 5000\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 4992\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1394392554\nX-OAuth-Scopes: admin:org, admin:public_key, admin:repo_hook, delete_repo, gist, notifications, repo, user\nX-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes:\nX-GitHub-Media-Type: github.beta\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nContent-Length: 192\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-GitHub-OTP, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nX-GitHub-Request-Id: 36516151:3CF7:550E408:531CAFDA\n\n{\"message\":\"Validation Failed\",\"documentation_url\":\"http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#edit-a-release\",\"errors\":[{\"resource\":\"Release\",\"code\":\"already_exists\",\"field\":\"tag_name\"}]}>\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
