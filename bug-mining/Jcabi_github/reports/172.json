Let's implement a new method keys(), which should return an instance of interface PublicKeys. This interface should have at least methods 1) iterate() to list all public keys of a user, 2) get(String) to get a single public key, 3) remove(String) to remove a key. Every key should be an instance of interface PublicKey, extending JsonReadable and JsonPatchable. All of the new classes should be implemented with GhPublicKeys and GhPublicKey classes. We should create integration and unit tests, and implement MkPublicKeys and MkPublicKey classes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmarkov","id":5993843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTM4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5993843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov","html_url":"https://github.com/dmarkov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
