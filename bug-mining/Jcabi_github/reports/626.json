On the other hand, mostly we use generated repo for each test(or test class). I think that it's not only about aesthetics or philosophy. I think that test run must be as similar as possible for different developers. Such a predefined repos makes differences... because one developer use repository with specific configuration and other developer use another repo with different configuration. And their results have possibility to be different. Also it's about usability: why we need to have extra configuration for tests without real reason?\nMy opinion, that we should check all code places where we use `failsafe.github.repo` and answer the question if we really need repos provided from outside(as I remember we used it in some cases because we couldn't create commits, in this case it was reasonable to provide repo with commits). I'm really sure that, at least, in `RtIssueITCase` we can use generated repo like we do in  `RtTagITCase`, for example. In this cases, I think, we should replace repo configuration with repo generation.\n","closed_by":{"login":"aistomin","id":1029530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjk1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1029530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin","html_url":"https://github.com/aistomin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/808/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
