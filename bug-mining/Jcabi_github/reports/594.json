And this methods implemented in different styles. I mean following methods:\n1. MkContents.create(): here branch supposed to be provided inside JsonObject and if it isn't provided than we use `master`.\n2. MkContents.get() here `ref` parameter is strongly required.\n3. MkContents.readme() here we have two methods. One of them uses `ref` parameter and another uses hard-coded \"master\" string(by the way: why method without parameter don't use method with parameter passing \"master\" string? I think that it's little duplication in these methods).\nWe should refactor this methods to be implemented in unified style. According to this issue: #757 probably we should create 2 methods in each case: the first will be \"default\" without branch parameter, the second - with branch parameter.\n","closed_by":{"login":"aistomin","id":1029530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjk1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1029530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin","html_url":"https://github.com/aistomin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aistomin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
