Their respective signatures are\n\n```\nContent create(\n    @NotNull(message = \"path is never NULL\") String path,\n    @NotNull(message = \"message is never NULL\") String message,\n    @NotNull(message = \"content is never NULL\") String content)\n    throws IOException;\n\nCommit remove(\n    @NotNull(message = \"path is never NULL\") String path,\n    @NotNull(message = \"message is never NULL\") String message,\n    @NotNull(message = \"sha is never NULL\") String sha)\n    throws IOException;\n```\n\nThe Github Contents API also allows for the specification of the branch name (`master` will be used if it is unspecified), as well as the committer's name and email address. This is currently not addressed by our API, which means that all `create` and `remove` operations will commit to `master` and will not include any of the committer's details.\n\nIt would be good if we can include a `Map` parameter for these optional fields, as per our input parameter design standards ([as seen here](https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github/commit/37d3cfd)). The result would be something like this:\n\n```\nContent create(\n    @NotNull(message = \"path is never NULL\") String path,\n    @NotNull(message = \"message is never NULL\") String message,\n    @NotNull(message = \"content is never NULL\") String content,\n    @NotNull(message= \"params is never NULL\") Map<String, String> params)\n    throws IOException;\n\nCommit remove(\n    @NotNull(message = \"path is never NULL\") String path,\n    @NotNull(message = \"message is never NULL\") String message,\n    @NotNull(message = \"sha is never NULL\") String sha,\n    @NotNull(message= \"params is never NULL\") Map<String, String> params)\n    throws IOException;\n```\n\nWe should update the `RtContents` and `MkContents` implementing classes accordingly. Note that as per our coding standards, `null` should never be used; if the parameters are unspecified, pass along an empty `Map` instance (e.g. `Collections.emptyMap()`) to `params`, in the case you need to do this (for unit/integration testing and so on).\n\nFor more details about the two methods above, see [\"Create a File\"](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-a-file) and [\"Delete a File\"](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#delete-a-file).\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/398/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
