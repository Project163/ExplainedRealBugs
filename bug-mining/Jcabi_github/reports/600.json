Afterwards I'm reading that some more dependencies are needed for runtime: http://github.jcabi.com/dependencies.html\n\nI've downloaded each one that is mentioned manually but errors about missing dependencies persist. I then add all the dependencies mentioned on the page (those required for testing, compiling) and different errors but still not working.\n\nAt this point I download the most recent version of your code from github, get all the dependencies automatically from Maven but note the huge number of libraries that are needed for this project to work.\n\nWould it be possible to provide a single (fat) jar with all dependencies included?\n\nSecond request: Perhaps possible to trim the non-used dependencies? For example, I see jars for interacting with twitter, don't know if these are really needed.\n\nIdeally, end-developers not adopting Maven on their work would sincerely appreciate to simply download a jar file, include it as library and starting using your project.\n\nIn the current state, I'm unable to use the code.\n\nThanks for taking this request into consideration.\n\nWith kind regards,\nNuno Brito\n","closed_by":{"login":"maxbrito","id":3287582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3287582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/823/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
