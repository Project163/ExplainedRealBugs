Now this presents an inconsistency:\n- The interface `RepoCommits` represents objects that refer to requests to `/repos/:owner/:repo/commits` as implemented in `RtRepoCommits`. Refer to [Repositories Commits API](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/).\n- The `Commit` interface pertains to requests to `/repos/:owner/:repo/git/commits` as implemented in `RtCommit`. Refer: [Git Data Commits API](http://developer.github.com/v3/git/commits/).\n\nThis seems problematic. Perhaps we should create a new interface `RepoCommit` and update `RepoCommits#get` in order to return this type.\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
