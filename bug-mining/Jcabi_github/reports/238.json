However, based on http://developer.github.com/v3/orgs/, each organization should have its own login (in the same way that a user has its own login), although a User can have a list of organizations that he belongs to.\n\nNow, shouldn't the interface `Organization` be defined in terms of its login (and define define a method `String login()`) instead? We can have the `id` property exposed by `Organization.Smart` instead of defined by the `Organization` interface as it is currently defined.\n\nAs for the `user()` I don't see why it belongs to the `Organization` interface, even if `User` can iterate through a list of organizations.\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
