Take for example the following code from `Comment.Smart`:\n\n```\n/**\n * Get its URL.\n * @return URL of comment\n * @throws IOException If there is any I/O problem\n */\npublic URL url() throws IOException {\n    return new URL(new SmartJson(this).text(\"url\"));\n}\n/**\n * When this comment was created.\n * @return Date of creation\n * @throws IOException If there is any I/O problem\n */\npublic Date createdAt() throws IOException {\n    try {\n        return new Github.Time(\n            new SmartJson(this).text(\"created_at\")\n        ).date();\n    } catch (ParseException ex) {\n        throw new IOException(ex);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRepeated creation of `SmartJson` is not necessary, since `SmartJson` is immutable and so are the `Smart` classes that use it. It will be just as safe and will be faster and more memory efficient if we store it as a final field and reuse it every time we need to fetch a `JSON` attribute.\n\nLike so:\n\n```\n/**\n * SmartJson object for convenient JSON parsing.\n */\nprivate final transient SmartJson jsn;\n\n/**\n * Public ctor.\n * @param cmt Comment\n */\npublic Smart(Comment cmt) {\n    //...existing constructor code\n   this.jsn = new SmartJson(cmt);\n}\n//...*snip*...\n/**\n * Get its URL.\n * @return URL of comment\n * @throws IOException If there is any I/O problem\n */\npublic URL url() throws IOException {\n    return new URL(this.jsn.text(\"url\"));\n}\n/**\n * When this comment was created.\n * @return Date of creation\n * @throws IOException If there is any I/O problem\n */\npublic Date createdAt() throws IOException {\n    try {\n        return new Github.Time(\n            this.jsn.text(\"created_at\")\n        ).date();\n    } catch (ParseException ex) {\n        throw new IOException(ex);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe should do this for all our `Smart` classes, not just `Comment.Smart`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
