 rule I tried to follow in this library is that its interfaces represent all REST methods of Github API, but no more than that. When Github API returns JSON our interfaces don't parse them. We just return `JsonObject`, like it's done in `Issue.json()`, `Comment.json()`, etc. When parsing is required, we have `*.Smart` classes. They implement that supplementary parse operations.\n\nSo, in this case we should implement iterate, get, create, edit and delete. Since all of them are REST methods.\n\nSo, no, we don't need to define methods in `Hook` for attributes retrieval. We just provide `json()`, and a `Smart` decorator.\n\nI would recommend to start with:\n1. implement `RtHooksTest` the way you think it should work\n2. create interfaces\n3. create stub classes that throw `UnsupportedOperationException`\n4. skip tests created in step 1 and mark them with `@todo` puzzles\n5. add `RtHooksITCase`, skeleton only, with one puzzle asking to implement it\n\nThe most important task here for you is in step 1.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/comments/31605262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yegor256","id":526301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256","html_url":"https://github.com/yegor256","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/comments/31607714","html_url":"https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/122#issuecomment-31607714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/122","id":31607714,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjA3NzE0","user":{"login":"longtimeago","id":1388994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago","html_url":"https://github.com/longtimeago","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-05T16:10:53Z","updated_at":"2014-01-05T16:10:53Z","body":"Thank you for explanation!

Here it comes:\n\n``` java\npublic interface Hooks {\n}\n```\n\nand the method (also in the `Repo` interface, of course):\n\n``` java\nfinal class RtRepo {\n  public Hooks hooks() {\n    return new RtHooks(this.entry, this);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCommit. Run unit tests again. Do they pass? No, I can't even compile, since `RtHooks` is absent. OK, do I have time? Yes, still have time. I'm in TDD domain, so let's start with a test:\n\n``` java\nclass RtHooksTest {\n  void canFetchEmptyListOfHooks() {    \n    MkContainer container = new MkGrizzlyContainer().next(\n      new MkAnswer.Simple(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK, \"[]\")\n    ).start();\n    Hooks hooks = new RtHooks(\n      new JdkRequest(container.home()),\n      Mockito.mock(Repo.class)\n    );\n    MatcherAssert.assertThat(\n      hooks.iterate(),\n      Matchers.emptyIterable()\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCommit. Does it pass? No, since there is no class `RtHooks` and there is no method `iterate()` in it (and it's not in the interface). OK, do I have more time? Yes, I do, let's create it. Here it goes (and define it in the interface):\n\n``` java\nfinal class RtHooks {\n  RtHooks() {\n    // ...\n  }\n  public Iterable<Hook> iterate() {\n    return Collections.emptyList();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCommit. Tests pass? No, not yet. I don't have `MkHooks`. OK, let's start with a test too. Let's create `MkHooksTest`, with a simple scenario:\n\n``` java\nclass MkHooksTest {\n  void canFetchEmptyListOfHooks() {    \n    Hooks hooks = MkHooksTest.repo().hooks();\n    MatcherAssert.assertThat(\n      hooks.iterate(),\n      Matchers.emptyIterable()\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd I have to create `MkHooks` class and return an empty list of hooks from its `iterate()` method.\n\nCommit. So, do we compile and pass now? Yes, the entire code base compiles and passes all tests. Good. What now? Now I'm running out of time, since I need to send it all through code review and it may be bounced. So, let's reserve some time for it. Besides that, I didn't cover the entire scope, since `Hooks` should have many more features, as the ticket explains. Ok, let's get back to the unit test and add some puzzles:\n\n``` java\nclass RtHooksTest {\n  void canFetchEmptyListOfHooks() {    \n    // ...\n  }\n  /**\n   * @todo #122 RtHooks should iterate multiple hooks. Let's implement\n   *   a test here and a method of RtHooks. The method should iterate\n   *   multiple hooks. See how it's done in other classes with GhPagination.\n   *   When done, remove this puzzle and Ignore annotation from the method.\n   */\n  @Ignore\n  void canFetchNonEmptyListOfHooks() {    \n  }\n  /**\n   * @todo #122 RtHooks should be able to get a single Hook. Let's implement\n   *   a test here and a method get() of RtHooks. The method should fetch a single\n   *   hook. See how it's done in other classes, using Rexsl request/response.\n   *   When done, remove this puzzle and Ignore annotation from the method.\n   */\n  @Ignore\n  void canFetchSingleHook() {    \n  }\n}\n```\n\nCommit. I would add more test methods there, one per each usage scenario (not just per method, but per scenario, like it's done with fetching empty list and non-empty list). No need to do the same for `MkHooksTest`, since when new methods will be introduced to `MkHooks` they automatically will be tested. No need to make extra tasks/puzzles for them. OK, am I done? There should be also an integration test. OK, let's create one:\n\n``` java\nclass RtHooksITCase {\n  /**\n   * @todo #122 RtHooks should be able to fetch a list of hooks from a real\n   *   Github repository. a single Hook.  \n   *   When done, remove this puzzle and Ignore annotation from the method.\n   */\n  @Ignore\n  void canFetchAllHooks() {\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCommit. Looks like I'm ready to wrap up. Did I cover the entire scope of the ticket? Looks like it. OK, I push and make a pull request.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/comments/31608524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yegor256","id":526301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256","html_url":"https://github.com/yegor256","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/comments/31609065","html_url":"https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/122#issuecomment-31609065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/122","id":31609065,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjA5MDY1","user":{"login":"longtimeago","id":1388994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODg5OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1388994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago","html_url":"https://github.com/longtimeago","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/longtimeago/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-05T17:00:55Z","updated_at":"2014-01-05T17:01:38Z","body":"Wow!
