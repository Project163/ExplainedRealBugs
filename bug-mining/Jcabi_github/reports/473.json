However, this method is redundant for the following reasons:\n1. We already have a method `DeployKey#remove()`, in which a specific deploy key removes itself. This is implemented by both `RtDeployKey` and `MkDeployKey`, and I think this is the proper place to implement this method.\n2. The `DeployKeys` interface does _not_ specify any `remove` method, only `DeployKey` does. In other words, `RtDeployKeys#remove(int number)` will be _invisible_ to users of the `DeployKeys` interface unless they cast to `RtDeployKeys`, which is a bad idea anyway.\n\nThus, I recommend that we simply remove the `remove(int number)` method from `RtDeployKeys`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
