In this case, the `path` parameter actually means two things here:\n- `Content.update()` uses `path` to refer to the *file / path name` of the content.\n- `JsonPatch.patch()` interprets `path` as the _XPath location_ of the XML node to be updated.\n\nSecond, for the `json` parameter, we should actually be passing the `content` attribute of the JSON parameter only, since that is the only node that we're updating. The rest of the parameters are used for the `RepoCommit` being returned, we don't want them in the updated content node.\n\nIt needs to be dong something like the following:\n\n``` java\nString xpath = String.format(\"%s/content[path='%s']/content\", this.xpath(), path);\nnew JsonPatch(this.storage).patch(\n    xpath,\n    Json.createObjectBuilder().add(\"content\", json.getString(\"content\")).build()\n);\n```\n\nWe should correct the bugs above.\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
