This implements compareTo but relies on the Object.equals method.\n\nFrom the JavaDoc for the compareTo method in the Comparable interface:\nIt is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact. The recommended language is \"Note: this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals.\"\n","closed_by":{"login":"pbao","id":325150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTE1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/325150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao","html_url":"https://github.com/pbao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
