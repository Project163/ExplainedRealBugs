Let's add a method assignees() to this class returning an instance of interface Assignees. This interface should have at least two methods: 1) iterate() returning a list of Users and 2) check(String) returning TRUE if provided login can be used as an assignee in repository. New interface should be implemented by GhAssignees class and tested in unit and integration tests. Moreover, we should implement MkAssignees class.
