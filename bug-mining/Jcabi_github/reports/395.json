Let's implement a new method emails() that returns an instance of class UserEmails with a few methods: 1) iterate() returning a list of strings, 2) add(String), and 3) remove(String). Let's use the new response format suggested by Github: http://developer.github.com/v3/users/emails/#list-email-addresses-for-a-user This new UserEmails interface should be implemented by GhUserEmails, tested in a unit and integration tests. Besides that, we should implement MkUserEmails class.\n","closed_by":{"login":"dmarkov","id":5993843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTM4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5993843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov","html_url":"https://github.com/dmarkov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmarkov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/17/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/17/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
