Sometimes creation results in duplicate names which cause our builds to fail in an intermittent fashion.\n\nFor example, in `RtRepos.create()`, the repo name is created using `RandomNumeric(5)`. I think, at the minimum, we should use `RandomAlphanumeric(10)` for all names that have to be unique, whereever we can use them (not just in RtRepos). This will minimize the chances of our builds failing because of two concurrently executing tests generating the same name.\n\nSee from one of our recent [Rultor build logs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/relics.rultor.com/urn:facebook:1531296526/jcabi-github-on-pull-request/stdout/2014-04-28T13:45:00Z/log.txt):\n\n```\n[0;31mERRORm] pool-105-thread-1 com.jcabi.github.RtRepos: #create({\\\"name\\\":\\\"83570\\\"}): thrown java.lang.AssertionError(HTTP response status is not equal to 201:\n422 Unprocessable Entity [https://api.github.com/user/repos]\nServer: GitHub.com\nDate: Mon, 28 Apr 2014 13:56:38 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nStatus: 422 Unprocessable Entity\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 5000\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 4406\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1398693911\nX-OAuth-Scopes: admin:org, admin:public_key, admin:repo_hook, delete_repo, gist, notifications, repo, user\nX-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: public_repo, repo\nX-GitHub-Media-Type: github.v3\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\nX-Frame-Options: deny\nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'\nContent-Length: 215\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Link, X-GitHub-OTP, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, X-Poll-Interval\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nX-GitHub-Request-Id: AE81AD3B:6E14:61EAE7:535E5E16\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n\n{\"message\":\"Validation Failed\",\"documentation_url\":\"https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create\",\"errors\":[{\"resource\":\"Repository\",\"code\":\"custom\",\"field\":\"name\",\"message\":\"name already exists on this account\"}]}\nExpected: HTTP response with status 201\n     but: was <422 Unprocessable Entity [https://api.github.com/user/repos]\nServer: GitHub.com\nDate: Mon, 28 Apr 2014 13:56:38 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nStatus: 422 Unprocessable Entity\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 5000\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 4406\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1398693911\nX-OAuth-Scopes: admin:org, admin:public_key, admin:repo_hook, delete_repo, gist, notifications, repo, user\nX-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: public_repo, repo\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"carlosmiranda","id":1917892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTc4OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1917892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosmiranda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosmiranda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
