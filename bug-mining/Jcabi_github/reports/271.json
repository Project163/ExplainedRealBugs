So it always assumes that the response consists of JsonObject array.\nIt's impossible to use RtPagination class if response consist of string arrays.\n\nRtPagination along with its nested Mapping could be parameterized with one more parameter \"P extends JsonValue\".This parameter should be used instead of JsonObject type. It allows to use the same logic based on any json value subtype of JsonValue.\n\nThis functionality is required for #212.\n","closed_by":{"login":"den-anisimov","id":6423296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjMyOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6423296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov","html_url":"https://github.com/den-anisimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/den-anisimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
