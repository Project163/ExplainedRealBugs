The result is that it needs to access the Set, once to get all the keys and then many more times to get the values. \n\nIt is more efficient to call obj.entrySet() then you can just loop over the entries and access the values directly. \n","closed_by":{"login":"pbao","id":325150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTE1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/325150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao","html_url":"https://github.com/pbao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pbao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
