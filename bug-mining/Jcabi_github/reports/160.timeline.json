Briefly, with a short example.\n\nThen, a link to this page should be added in `src/site/site.xml`. Try it and I'll correct you if it goes wrong.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/comments/31645318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yegor256","id":526301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256","html_url":"https://github.com/yegor256","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yegor256/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/comments/31729832","html_url":"https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/107#issuecomment-31729832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-github/issues/107","id":31729832,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzI5ODMy","user":{"login":"asinyagin","id":700837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/700837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin","html_url":"https://github.com/asinyagin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asinyagin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-07T11:17:38Z","updated_at":"2014-01-07T11:20:24Z","body":"@yegor256 I can't think up how to test CarefulWire's sleeping and logging.
