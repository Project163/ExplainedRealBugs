 <!-- DISABLE PIG COMMANDS AND OPERATORS -->
     <section>
-       <title>Disabling Pig commands and operators</title>
-           <p>This is an admin feature providing ability to blacklist or/and whitelist certain commands and operations. Pig exposes a few of these that could be not very safe in a multitenant environment. For example, "sh" invokes shell commands, "set" allows users to change non-final configs. While these are tremendously useful in general, having an ability to disable would make Pig a safer platform. The goal is to allow administrators to be able to have more control over user scripts. Default behaviour would still be the same - no filters applied on commands and operators.</p>

-           <h4>Blacklisting</h4>
-             <p>Set "pig.blacklist" to a comma-delimited set of operators and commands. For eg, <i>pig.blacklist=rm,kill,cross</i> would disable users from executing any of "rm", "kill" commands and "cross" operator.</p>

-           <h4>Whitelisting</h4>
-             <p>This is an even safer approach to disallowing functionality in Pig. Using this you will be able to disable all commands and operators that are not a part of the whitelist. For eg, <i>pig.whitelist=load,filter,store</i> will disallow every command and operator other than "load", "filter" and "store". </p>
