+      Added "move and copy" workflow, where a table to be altered is copied to
+      a new one with the new structure and the old one dropped, is now
+      implemented for SQLite as well as all database backends in general
+      using the new :meth:`.Operations.batch_alter_table` system.   This
+      directive provides a table-specific operations context which gathers
+      column- and constraint-level mutations specific to that table, and
+      at the end of the context creates a new table combining the structure
+      of the old one with the given changes, copies data from old table to new,
+      and finally drops the old table,
+      renaming the new one to the existing name.  This is required for
+      fully featured SQLite migrations, as SQLite has very little support for the
+      traditional ALTER directive.   The batch directive
+      is intended to produce code that is still compatible with other databases,
+      in that the "move and copy" process only occurs for SQLite by default,
+      while still providing some level of sanity to SQLite's
+      requirement by allowing multiple table mutation operations to
+      proceed within one "move and copy" as well as providing explicit
+      control over when this operation actually occurs.  The "move and copy"
+      feature may be optionally applied to other backends as well, however
+      dealing with referential integrity constraints from other tables must
+      still be handled explicitly.

 Migration tools are instead expected to produce copies of SQLite tables that
 correspond to the new structure, transfer the data from the existing

 in a way that is reasonably predictable, while also remaining compatible
