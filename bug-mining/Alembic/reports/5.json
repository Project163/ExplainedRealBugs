For example, `create_check_constraint` shows:\n\n```\nfrom alembic import op\nfrom sqlalchemy.sql import column, func\n\nop.create_check_constraint(\n    \"ck_user_name_len\",\n    \"user\",\n    func.len(column('name')) > 5\n)\n```\n\nHowever, the [bulk_insert](https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ops.html#alembic.operations.Operations.bulk_insert) example does not show op being imported, or use with the `bulk_insert` function. The `from alembic import op` line should be added, and the `bulk_insert` should be changed to `op.bulk_insert` to make it more like the other examples.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
