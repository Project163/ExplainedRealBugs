Modified _append_template to ensure proper TOML section spacing\r\n- Added special handling for .toml files to insert two newlines between sections\r\n- Added tests to prevent regression\r\n- Fixes #1679\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a general summary of your proposed changes in the Title field above -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR fixes issue #1679 where `alembic init --template pyproject` would concatenate sections without proper spacing when appending to an existing `pyproject.toml` file.\r\n\r\n**Problem**: The `[tool.alembic]` section was appended directly after the last line of the existing content, resulting in invalid TOML:\r\n[tool.mypy]\r\npython_version = \"3.10\"[tool.alembic]\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Modified `_append_template` method in `ScriptDirectory` to detect TOML files and ensure proper spacing (2 newlines) between top-level sections.\r\n\r\n**Result**: Proper TOML formatting is maintained:\r\n```toml\r\n[tool.mypy]\r\npython_version = \"3.10\"\r\n\r\n[tool.alembic]\r\nscript_location = \"%(here)s/alembic\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into clickable checkboxes once the PR is submitted, so no need to do everything at once)\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request is:\r\n\r\n- [ ] A documentation / typographical error fix\r\n\t- Good to go, no issue or tests are needed\r\n- [ x] A short code fix\r\n\t- please include the issue number, and create an issue if none exists, which\r\n\t  must include a complete example of the issue.  one line code fixes without an\r\n\t  issue and demonstration will not be accepted.\r\n\t- Please include: `Fixes: #<issue number>` in the commit message\r\n\t- please include tests.   one line code fixes without tests will not be accepted.\r\n- [ ] A new feature implementation\r\n\t- please include the issue number, and create an issue if none exists, which must\r\n\t  include a complete example of how the feature would look.\r\n\t- Please include: `Fixes: #<issue number>` in the commit message\r\n\t- please include tests.\r\n\r\n**Have a nice
