Provide a general summary of your proposed changes in the Title field above -->\r\n\r\nFIXES #1665\r\n\r\nCurrently the type of `down_revision` in migration templates is `Union[str, None]`. However, when you generate a migration using `alembic merge heads` it will generate a migration with a tuple of strings in `down_revision` which causes a type error.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nf.e. when you have 2 heads and run `alembic merge heads` you will get a migration that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nrevision: str = \"6cee9e23ed4b\"\r\ndown_revision: Union[str, None] = (\"aba1172f1a9f\", \"cdd5e67db84f\")\r\nbranch_labels: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = None\r\ndepends_on: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = None\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich will give a type error with type checkers like mypy and pyright. This change fixes this. From the code it seems like just like `branch_labels` and `depends_on` the `down_revision` is first casted to a tuple if needed so typing it as `Sequence[str]` and not `Tuple[str, ...]` should be safe.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into clickable checkboxes once the PR is submitted, so no need to do everything at
