[link](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/blob/bd50ba325b10a1a9cdb452fe40c96f959825797c/tests/test_script_production.py#L245-L307)\r\n\r\n- I also tested all the available `tzdata` versions, and all of them were good:\r\n```\r\nVersion `2024.2`: 597 timezones\r\nVersion `2024.1`: 597 timezones\r\nVersion `2023.1`: 597 timezones\r\nVersion `2022.1`: 595 timezones\r\nVersion `2021.1`: 594 timezones\r\nVersion `2020.1`: 594 timezones\r\nVersion `2020.1rc1`: 594 timezones\r\nVersion `2020.1rc0`: 594 timezones\r\nVersion `1.2016.8`: 421 timezones (annulled version)\r\nVersion `1.2016.7`: 421 timezones (annulled version)\r\nVersion `1.2016.6`: 421 timezones\r\nVersion `1.2016.5a1`: 421 timezones (annulled version)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Also, there's already non-pinned version in [`tox.ini`](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/blob/bd50ba325b10a1a9cdb452fe40c96f959825797c/tox.ini#L27), so I think just `tzdata` should be good\r\n\r\n- And I also installed my fix via `pip
