include a token called `REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME` which can be used in the `options` setting of a post-write hook. This token is replaced by the filename of the revision script, allowing the filename to be passed to the post-write hook in a flexible manner. Thus I can do:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[post_write_hooks]\r\nhooks = pre-commit\r\npre-commit.type = console_scripts\r\npre-commit.entrypoint = pre-commit\r\npre-commit.options = run --files REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the existing behavior is to prepend `REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME` to the argument list. In order to preserve backwards compatibility, this is done when `REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME` is not present.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n* Implement the `REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME` token.\r\n* Switch from `str.split()` to `shlex.split()` for robust command line argument processing.\r\n* Insert `REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME` in appropriate locations in the docs and templates.\r\n* Properly document that `REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME` is prepended instead of appended to the argument list.\r\n* Refactored existing \"test of `black` as a post-write hook\" in order to avoid code duplication.\r\n* Add a test for `REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME` and shlex.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into clickable checkboxes once the PR is submitted, so no need to do everything at once)\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request is:\r\n\r\n- [X] A new feature implementation\r\n\t- please include the issue number, and create an issue if none exists, which must\r\n\t  include a complete example of how the feature would look.\r\n\t- Please include: `Fixes: #<issue number>` in the commit message\r\n\t- please include tests.\r\n\r\nFixes issue #819
