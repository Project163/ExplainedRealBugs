Logic would need to be added that first looks in place for .pyc or .pyo files, then the load module system needs to be modified.\n\nAlso, pep3147 might need to be taken into account; this is where the files would instead be in a `__pycache__` directory and there's no simple way to locate these files.  The good news is that per pep3147 it seems they will continue to support a .pyc or .pyo file sitting next to the .py (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147/#case-4-legacy-pyc-files-and-source-less-imports).  However the system you're using to \"strip the .py files away\" may be too simplistic to work like this - in Python 3 the .pyc file won't just be sitting there normally.\n\nHere's a partial diff to handle being able to load the .pyc/.pyo.
