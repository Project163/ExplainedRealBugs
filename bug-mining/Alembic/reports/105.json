Furthermore, this file is not included in `.gitignore`, so it clutters the `git status`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect that running `tox` should have minimal side-effects, and that any such side-effects should be automatically ignored by `git`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic.git\r\ncd alembic\r\ntox\r\ngit status\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Error**\r\n\r\n```\r\nOn branch master\r\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.\r\n\r\nUntracked files:\r\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\r\n\tpysqlite_test_schema.db\r\n\r\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Versions.**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n - Python: 3.8 via tox\r\n - Alembic: `master`\r\n - SQLAlchemy: ?
