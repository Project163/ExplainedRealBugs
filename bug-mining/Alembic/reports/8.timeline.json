You can generally replicate it yourself directly with something like:\n\n```console\n$ python -c 'for i in range(100000): print(i)' | head\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nBrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe\nException BrokenPipeError: BrokenPipeError(32, 'Broken pipe') in <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'> ignored\n```\n\nNOTE: In Python 3.3 you'll get a `BrokenPipeError`, in versions prior its just a plain `IOError`\n\nTo cause it you basically need:\n\n- python to write a large block of data to (a piped) `stdout`.  It has to be enough to overflow the write buffer.\n- the pipe reader to quit/die.  As long as the writer has overflown the buffer on the block the reader was reading, then the writer will die with the above exception.  (e.g. it won't die if you reduce that loop size).\n\nIt happens because pythons default signal handling is setup to handle a `SIGPIPE` by raising an exception (similar to the way it handles a `SIGINT` by raising `KeyboardInterrupt`).\n\nOptions for removing this annoyance:\n\n- just wrap your output routines in a `try: … catch IOError:`\n\n- flush `stdout` regularly … yuck … bad design\n\n- alter the `SIGPIPE` handler \n\n```python\nimport signal\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE, signal.SIG_DFL)\n```\n\neg\n\n```console\n$ python -c 'import signal; signal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE,
