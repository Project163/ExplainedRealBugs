It wasn't immediately clear that bulk_insert needs an object, and when I realised that, it was clear that the op.create_table route couldn't be used.\n\nMany examples use sqlalchemy.sql.table to create the table, but it's not clear to me how constraints are added to those.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
