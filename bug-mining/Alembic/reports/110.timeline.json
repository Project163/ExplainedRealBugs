https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/1235\r\nfix KeyError of `prefix = autogen_context.opts[\"user_module_prefix\"]` in render.py\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI've made a small snippet to generate create_table ops for my models\r\n```python\r\ndef create_orm_migration(metadata):\r\n\r\n    operations = []\r\n    for table in metadata.tables.values():\r\n        if table.name.startswith('meeting_note'):\r\n            operations.append(\r\n                ops.CreateTableOp.from_table(table)\r\n            )\r\n            for idx in table.indexes:\r\n                operations.append(ops.CreateIndexOp.from_index(idx))\r\n\r\n    print(autogenerate.render_python_code(\r\n        ops.UpgradeOps(ops=operations),\r\n        ), \r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nand it raises KeyError because UUID is defined in other modules.\r\n```python\r\nfrom portal.utils.db import UUID\r\n\r\nBase = declarative_base()\r\n\r\nclass MeetingNotes(Base, CommonFieldsMixin):\r\n    __tablename__ = 'meeting_note_notes'\r\n\r\n    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid1)\r\n    date = Column(Date)\r\n    duration = Column(Integer)\r\n    category = Column(String(1024))\r\n    type = Column(String())\r\n    host_employee_number = Column(Integer)\r\n    content = Column(Text(100000))\r\n    title = Column(String(1024))\r\n    agenda = Column(Text())\r\n```\r\nthis happens in `autogenerate.render:_user_autogenerate_prefix`, first I attempt to change \r\n\r\n```python\r\nprefix = autogen_context.opts[\"user_module_prefix\"]\r\n# to\r\nprefix = autogen_context.opts.get(\"user_module_prefix\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter I review code around, I guess this is designed to use `[]` instead of `.get()`, so I follow the code style and add the default argument `user_module_prefix` into `autogenerate.api:render_python_code`\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nThis pull request is:\r\n\r\n- [ ] A documentation / typographical error fix\r\n\t-
