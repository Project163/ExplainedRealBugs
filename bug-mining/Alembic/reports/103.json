My config was\r\n\r\n```\r\nhooks = pre-commit\r\npre-commit.type = console_scripts\r\npre-commit.entrypoint = pre-commit\r\npre-commit.options = run --files\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe failure occurred because the pre-commit command was being run as\r\n```bash\r\npre-commit /path/to/revision_file.py run --files\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```bash\r\npre-commit run --files /path/to/revision_file.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html#basic-formatter-configuration) states:\r\n> The path of the revision file is sent as a single positional argument to the script after the options.\r\n\r\nHowever, checking the code, [this is not the case](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/blob/8043d5d2b46a2d12e445c8d352d0249447340613/alembic/script/write_hooks.py#L111), as it is being passed as the *first* argument.\r\n\r\n**Additional note**\r\n\r\nThe command line [options are being split](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/blob/8043d5d2b46a2d12e445c8d352d0249447340613/alembic/script/write_hooks.py#L113) using `str.split()`, but for command line options it's much better to use `shlex.split()` since that properly handles things like quoting.\r\n\r\n***PR incoming...***","closed_by":{"login":"CaselIT","id":16175304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc1MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16175304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT","html_url":"https://github.com/CaselIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
