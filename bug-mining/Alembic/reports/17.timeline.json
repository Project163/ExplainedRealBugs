\"op.f()\" directive, which is only there if you're using SQLA 0.9.4 or so with the latest alembic, as well as using anonymously-named indexes (e.g. index=True) which will make use of naming_convention.\n\nso to that extent I'm not exactly sure why luri reported that it all works now, the \"op.f()\" should render correctly but rendering happens long after we've determined what's to be added and removed.\n\nIf you are seeing index add/removes that are incorrect, we've already had three releases each of which resolved ever more issues with this new feature and I have no test cases left that illustrate this issue occurring.  So would need positive confirmation that if you run Alembic on master the issue of bogus indexes doesn't exist for you, I'm not seeing how that's possible at the
