Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\n      Extensive changes have been made to more fully support SQLAlchemy's new\n      naming conventions feature.  Note that while SQLAlchemy has added this\n      feature as of 0.9.2, some additional fixes in 0.9.4 are needed to\n      resolve some of the issues:\n\n      1. The :class:`.Operations` object now takes into account the naming\n         conventions that are present on the :class:`.MetaData` object that's\n         associated using :paramref:`~.EnvironmentContext.configure.target_metadata`.\n         When :class:`.Operations` renders a constraint directive like\n         ``ADD CONSTRAINT``, it now will make use of this naming convention\n         when it produces its own temporary :class:`.MetaData` object.\n\n      2. Note however that the autogenerate feature in most cases generates\n         constraints like foreign keys and unique constraints with the\n         final names intact; the only exception are the constraints implicit\n         with a schema-type like Boolean or Enum.  In most of these cases,\n         the naming convention feature will not take effect for these constraints\n         and will instead use the given name as is, with one exception....\n\n      3. Naming conventions which use the ``\"%(constraint_name)s\"`` token, that\n         is, produce a new name that uses the original name as a component,\n         will still be pulled into the naming convention converter and be\n         converted.  The problem arises when autogenerate renders a constraint\n         with it's already-generated name present in the migration file's source\n         code, the name will be doubled up at render time due to the combination\n         of #1 and #2.  So to work around this, autogenerate now renders these\n         already-tokenized names using the new :meth:`.Operations.f` component.\n         This component is only generated if **SQLAlchemy 0.9.4** or greater\n         is in use.\n\n      Therefore it is highly recommended that an upgrade to Alembic 0.6.4\n      be accompanied by an upgrade of SQLAlchemy 0.9.4, if the new naming\n      conventions feature is used.\n\nfixes #183\n\n\n→

Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nOK I really had to go nuts on this one to cover the bases, and its not clear that I took the best approach.  I like that an autogenerate run produces the constraints with their final name inline; this allows migration files to be independent of naming convention changes.  However I balked at going as far as making it do this automatically within Boolean() and Enum(), and also, I still wanted a way to write directives in a migration script where the naming conventions *do* take effect.   Usually, whether or not the name is None makes this easy to decide.  But because i wanted this stupid \"constraint_name\" token (which is because that's how i was using it already at work), it's not that simple (I don't know of any other good way to give CHECK constraints a deterministic and unique name, there has to be some kind of token, unless I pull out the columns I guess, but multiple CHECK constraints on a single column is very possible).   \n\nSo the new feature op.f() is now used to disambiguate names that have already been tokenized vs. those that have not.  It requires SQLAlchemy 0.9.4 for it to be usable.\n\nIf you want to try out SQLAlchemy 0.9.4 from master and this, feel free to let me know that this improves things.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/comments/441883835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/comments/441883836","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/183#issuecomment-441883836","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/183","id":441883836,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTg4MzgzNg==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-13T08:45:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T03:11:55Z","body":"**Marek Baczyński ([@imbaczek](https://github.com/imbaczek)) wrote:**\n\nI can confirm that using both SQLAlchemy and alembic master works as advertised.
