issue, originally created by Kim Silkebækken ([@Lokaltog](https://github.com/Lokaltog))**\n\nWhen creating models for Postgres/psycopg2 that have a column with a `server_default=func.current_timestamp()`, this statement gets replaced with `server_default='CURRENT_TIMESTAMP'` in the actual migration file. This raises the exception `psycopg2.NotSupportedError: date/time value \"current\" is no longer supported` when attempting to migrate, and to resolve this issue I have to manually edit the migrations file and replace the server default back to `func.current_timestamp()`.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n# Model:\nfrom sqlalchemy.sql import func\n\nclass Test(Base):\n\tcreated = Column(DateTime, server_default=func.current_timestamp())\n\n# Resulting migration:\ndef upgrade():\n\t# ...\n\tsa.Column('created', sa.DateTime(), server_default='CURRENT_TIMESTAMP')\n\t# ...\n\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is intended behavior (or if it's fixable through some configuration option), but if this issue is possible to resolve by e.g. detecting the database backend or just re-using the actual model

awesome.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/226/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T03:14:19Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T03:14:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/235","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/235/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/235/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/235/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/235","id":384601817,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODQ2MDE4MTc=","number":235,"title":"Quoting
