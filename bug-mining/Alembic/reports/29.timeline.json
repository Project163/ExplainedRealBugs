The \"nextval()\" expression here ideally wouldn't be generated, and we'd know this is the default SERIAL case.  But we don't get that info from PG.\n\nSorry you went through all that for the repro case, this is easy to reproduce just by sticking a table on the \"metadata\", running the upgrade, then removing the table and creating another autogen, producing this code:\n\n    \n    #!python\n    \n    \n    def downgrade():\n        ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###\n        op.create_table(u'x',\n        sa.Column(u'id', sa.INTEGER(), server_default=\"nextval('x_id_seq'::regclass)\", nullable=False),\n        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint(u'id', name=u'x_pkey')\n        )\n        ### end Alembic commands ###\n    \n    \n\nThe only solution here would be a hardcoded rule/regex in Alembic to have it completely guess that this exact pattern of default means the whole expression should be removed.   Usually, any function-based default with PG needs the text() expression surrounding it in any case, so this kind of issue always requires that the user review and edit the migration file.  But here, even if you put the text() around the expression so that it is no longer quoted, you still are missing the presence of the sequence itself.   \n\nI've never been comfortable with SQLAlchemy making this guess.  For Alembic, it's slightly less unacceptable, though I'd still consider placing a prominent warning or even an exception (to ensure the user reviews the file) so that these can be manually reviewed/corrected.   Autogenerated revisions should always be reviewed and they make no guarantee that they can produce accurate CREATE statements based on reflection, since this cannot be done without guessing which is something SQLA/Alembic aren't too enthused about doing.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/comments/441882173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/comments/441882182","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/73#issuecomment-441882182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/73","id":441882182,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTg4MjE4Mg==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-09-17T04:45:41Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T03:06:59Z","body":"**Changes

Is it that on upgrade, the sequence is created implicitly, but on downgrade, alembic is trying to reference the sequence explicitly, in order to be faithful to the original sequence name?\n\nEven if the quoting issue is fixed and an independent sequence is created, the sequence is slightly different from the original in that it doesn't get dropped along with the table.  But maybe that can be solved with some constraint (I am not very good with postgres, if you can't tell).\n\nWould a potentially hacky but pragmatic solution be to detect this scenario and emit the same creation statement in upgrades as downgrades?

But it doesn't take effect with table not under search path.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe result of autogererate should not contain server default for column id.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nRun the code below with an empty dataabse.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\r\nfrom alembic.autogenerate.api import produce_migrations\r\nfrom alembic.autogenerate.api import render_python_code\r\nfrom alembic.migration import MigrationContext\r\n\r\nengine = sa.create_engine(\"postgresql://name:pass@host:1234/tmp\")\r\nwith engine.connect() as conn, conn.begin():\r\n    conn.execute(sa.text(\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS test;\r\n        DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test.account;\r\n        CREATE TABLE test.account(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n    ))\r\nmetadata = sa.MetaData(schema=\"test\")\r\nmc = MigrationContext.configure(\r\n    connection=engine.connect(),\r\n    opts={\"include_schemas\": \"test\"}\r\n)\r\nmigration_script = produce_migrations(mc, metadata)\r\ndowngrade_code = render_python_code(migration_script.downgrade_ops)\r\nprint(downgrade_code)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Error**\r\n\r\n```\r\n# ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###\r\nop.create_table('account',\r\nsa.Column('id', sa.INTEGER(), server_default=sa.text(\"nextval('test.account_id_seq'::regclass)\"), autoincrement=True, nullable=False),\r\nsa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id', name='account_pkey'),\r\nschema='test'\r\n)\r\n# ### end Alembic commands ###\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Versions.**\r\n - OS:  macos 12.6.3\r\n - Python: 3.10.9\r\n - Alembic: 1.13.1\r\n - SQLAlchemy: 2.0.30\r\n - Database: PostgreSQL 13.14 \r\n - DBAPI: psycopg2-binary 2.9.9\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\nIn the [column reflect function](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/blob/main/alembic/ddl/postgresql.py#L221), it tries to check the relation of sequence between table by sequence name.
