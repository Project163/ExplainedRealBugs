On the the table picked up was a m2m rel defined using the basic Table()  pattern.\n\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n\"\"\"\nperson_to_role = Table('person_to_role', db.Model.metadata,\n    Column('person_id', Integer, ForeignKey('person.id')),\n    Column('role_id', Integer, ForeignKey('role.id')),\n    PrimaryKeyConstraint('person_id', 'role_id')\n)\n\n```\n\nThis generated the alembic migration, which at first seemed correct.\n\n```\n    op.create_table(u'person_to_role',\n    sa.Column(u'person_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=True),\n    sa.Column(u'role_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=True),\n    sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['person_id'], [u'person.id'], ),\n    sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['role_id'], [u'role.id'], ),\n    sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint(u'person_id', u'role_id')\n    )\n\n```\n\nI decided to run another migration expecting a blank migration to be created.  alembic actually generated an upgrade migration for the m2m model as follows.\n\n\n```\n    op.alter_column(u'person_to_role', u'person_id',\n               existing_type=sa.INTEGER(),\n               nullable=True)\n    op.alter_column(u'person_to_role', u'role_id',\n               existing_type=sa.INTEGER(),\n               nullable=True)\n\n```\n\nAs we can see, alembic is not trying to modify the columns so null would be a valid value which would obviously break at the db level anyway as both rows compose the PK and are created in the first migration like:\n\n```\nTable \"public.person_to_role\"\n  Column   |  Type   | Modifiers\n-----------+---------+-----------\n person_id | integer | not null\n role_id   | integer | not null\nIndexes:\n    \"person_to_role_pkey\" PRIMARY KEY, btree (person_id, role_id)\nForeign-key constraints:\n    \"person_to_role_person_id_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(id)\n    \"person_to_role_role_id_fkey\" FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES role(id)\n```\n\nWe can however see in the first migration that nullable=True was defined, just ignored due to the PrimaryKeyContraint.  setting nullable=False solves the problem for me, however i kinda felt this wasn`t the expected behaviour.  Should you explicitly set nullable=False in a Table def like this or is this actually a bug?\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
